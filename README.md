## Introduction 
Utilizing machine learning techniques for automated stock trading has always been an extremely hot topic ever since the massive success of Deep Learning in the past decade. While many approaches to directly modeling stock data as time-series data have yielded very little success, one approach that appeared to be promising is by performing sentiment analysis on media outlets. It is well known that stock prices can be massively influenced by news and media outlets, especially for companies with more volatile stocks (e.g. many of the tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, and Tesla). Hence, it is possible to predict the fluctuation of stock prices based on the overall sentiment from online media outlets and and comments. 

However, despite this possibility, past attempts has shown that predicting the exact change in stocks can be very difficult to achieve due to the complex nature in the trading dynamics. Hence, the goal of this project is to predict the general trend as the difference between the closing price at the beginning and the end of a trading period. The exact length of the period is going to be empirically determined as the the longest possible period that is within the range of effect of corresponding media sentiment.
