1,1,1,BB quietly building towards the inevitable software defined vehicle future we got excited about in 2021. QNX is being adopted all around.,"BB 2021 surge is today distant past. For anybody who stayed long BB it has been 2 years of pain doom gloom and suffering. 

But the bottom is in. And the fundamentals today are stronger than they have ever been. 

While the market shat on BB post the IVY frenzy the Chenster and his posse have been busy. 

Cyber is going to stabilize in next 2 quarters (see Chen interview at ICE). We prob wont see explosive growth but we dont need that right now. 

What we need is QNX growth and that is what we are going to get that per the TD investor conference yesterday:

1) QNX is on fire. Design wins are progressing at fastest speed. First 6 months generated highest number of design wins as the prior 12 months. 

2) Record number of developer seats deployed. That means preproduction design revenues are growing as evidenced by backlog going from 490 to 560. 

3) QNX Revenues on track to hit 15 percent yoy growth. The 200-215 range is secured. 

4) Slowing economy does not affect pace of QNX design wins. Auto OEMs are transitioning to modern car architecture and they have no choice but to integrate QNX. 

5) BMW highlighted as key customer win. No car OEM wants to build their own core operating system software. Its too hard and not a differentiator. It all goes to BB. Tesla is outlier. But BB thinks they can help Elon FYI.

6) ASP per QNX deployment not something they will disclose. But per car there are larger number of use cases for QNX. So on per car basis the Revenue per car is increasing. Example a high tech BMW will utilize multiple QNX deployments. 

Want a bonus catalyst? Ivy on track. Expect first big announcement at CES in january. Check out CES speakers. BMW chairman is one of the key speakers and BB just signed a big QNX deal with them. Before year end you can also get some Ivy news via amazon. amazon is hosting REinvent November 28-Dec 3. Expect some announcements.",z30m5v,2,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z30m5v/bb_quietly_building_towards_the_inevitable/,1669237725,11/23/2022 16:08,1.0
2,2,2,Upcoming Department of Defense Contract - Its a possibility - $MSFT and Kandy,"**Upcoming Department of Defense Contract - Its a possibility - $MSFT and Kandy**

A multi-page PDF is available from the call held on Sunday evening describing one investor's (mine) illustration of how Kandy would fit into the upcoming J.W.C.C.award announcement. (read as ""upgraded cloud for the federal government and for the department of defense"")

Kandy activitiy seems to be in two buckets:

Path A. an amazing amount of fine-tuning of Kandy to work underneath the Microsoft Teams Chat hood. Alot of this work was done between Microsoft and Ribbon, and then now Advent Technologies fully owns Kandy and seems to have recently completed the DRaas component requested or needed by $MSFT. So, relating to pathway A: this is at least one scenario for a buy out from one of the primes that is part of the IDIQ award on J.W.C.C.

Path B. to prepare Kandy as a pure cloud play solution, hence a keen focus on various softphone tools being able to integrated via the wrappers and software development libraries (sdk), and a focus on Kandy as a reseller of at least one of them called acrobits.

Path B is an obvious 100% focus should there be now buyout or Kandy is not playing a role in the federated communication model / dod communication model. Path B can exist in conjunction with Path A. Professional services headcount for Path B would utilize the various partners listed that are armed with the Kandy solution.

As a side note, J.W.C.C. replaces the original J.E.D.I. contract. Microsoft and Amazon are incumbents on the militarized and/or federated cloud with the U.S. Government. The PDF-file shows how the pieces are put together, as a possible solution based solely on due diligence.

As a key note, the due diligence stems from not only the author but a slew of persons reviewing hints and financials during multiple conference calls over the last few months.

A validation that has come through is the secure version of Microsoft's Azure cloud to be utilized by military contractors such as Lockheed Martin.

3,3,3,Non-Residential Construction Forecast: Slowing 2023-2024,"https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2022/10/25/non-residential-construction-forecast-slowing-2023-2024/?sh=272b2b137e63

Non-residential construction will shrink as the economy drops into recession sometime in the next year or so, due both to the higher interest rates by themselves and the reduced spending that will lead to. The decline won’t be devastating, but it will be significant.

The sector’s current position is puzzling today, with the number of dollars being spent growing moderately but costs up significantly. That usually means that actual activity is down after inflation adjustment. But positive signs conflict with that view. Employment for nonresidential construction is up, for both actual building activity as well as specialty trades. Other indicators look quite positive according to Ken Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors. Forecasting is more difficult, obviously, if we lack a good starting point.

The employment figures and positive industry anecdotes present more reliability than other data in this case. All things considered, it looks like real activity has increased by about four percent over the last 12 months.

The sectoral commentary below derives from on an economic forecast that anticipates recession starting in the second half of 2023 or possibly early 2024. A recession is not absolutely certain but highly likely. It will probably be of moderate severity. For comparison purposes, it will be milder than 2008-09 but worse than 2001.

The macroeconomic factors most at work on nonresidential construction will be the high and rising interest rates plus the decline in total spending that comes with a recession. But individual sectors will do better or worse than the aggregate based on their microeconomic conditions.

Commercial constitutes the largest category, with 21% of all nonresidential construction. It includes retail, restaurants and bars, as well as warehouses and wholesale facilities. This category has grown briskly since the summer of 2020. Warehouses have been particularly strong thanks to increased online sales. Retail, however, has not been as weak as it may seem. Large shopping malls are certainly not going up anymore, but grocery stores, restaurants and activity-based retail (gyms, spas, hands-on craft shops) have grown. Amazon is slowing its warehouse construction. Fortune Magazine reported, “MWPVL International Inc., which tracks Amazon’s real-estate footprint, estimates the company has either shuttered or killed plans to open 42 facilities totaling almost 25 million square feet of usable space.” However, warehouse vacancy rates across the country are quite low and announcements of new projects continue to be strong. Look for continued activity through 2023, with a slowdown late in that year due to general economic cooling.

Power plants are the next largest portion of private nonresidential construction. Spending has dropped 14% from a year ago. However, electric reliability is worsening in most of the country. Eventually we’ll increase spending, though higher interest rates prevent marginal projects from penciling out. Most likely, power construction will level off for two years then grow once again.

Manufacturing construction, in contrast, has grown substantially in the past year, up 22%. Three conflicting trends will drive activity in the coming years. First, the pandemic switch from spending on services to spending on goods is reversing, cutting the need for new manufacturing capacity. Second, the tight labor market is leading to additional purchases of automation and robotics equipment. This will sometimes require remodeling of existing facilities, and in rare cases brand new construction. Third, many companies in the United States would like to re-shore their own production and sourcing of materials and components. However, they are not willing to pay extremely higher costs for shorter supply chains, so this effect will be gradual over the coming years. On net, manufacturing construction will slow in 2023 and 2024.

The next largest category is office construction, which has held up surprisingly well. Some of the continued activity is large, multi-year projects that are being completed in a weaker market, but in some areas suburban offices are going up. That activity will likely shrink as the economy weakens in 2023 and 2024.

The smaller sectors of private nonresidential construction have been holding up a little better than the aggregate category. Healthcare continues to grow with the aging population. Communications is flat, with needed infrastructure mostly built out. Private education has increased with private school and daycare demand increasing. Lodging has staged a comeback from the pandemic decline and is likely to continue growing. Transportation has declined but probably needs to expand. Amusements and recreation has rebounded from the pandemic decline and will probably not decline due to pent up demand. Religious construction has been pretty level and will likely continue so. In all, these sectors should buoy to total private nonresidential activity.

Public sector construction, which is about two-thirds the size of private nonresidential construction, has begun creeping up after declining in the pandemic. The infrastructure bill will boost spending, but only some years from now, and even then gradually. The Buy America Act requires American-made construction materials and manufactured products, which will be hard to meet. Waivers are available for products not available from American producers, or available only at high cost, but securing waivers will add delays. In short, look for modest gain in public construction over the next two years, followed by stronger increases mid-decade.

Rolling this all together, nonresidential construction will suffer in late 2023 and into 2024, with recovery sometime in 2025. The downturn will not be severe but it will be noticeable for almost all parts of the industry. Businesses involved, either directly or indirectly, should sketch out contingency plans for significant sales declines.",z1bwkt,8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z1bwkt/nonresidential_construction_forecast_slowing/,1669068544,11/21/2022 17:09,0.0

The stock opened with a small gap down, my first idea was to take the stock from a resistance level created in the last few days at $94 together with the descending trend line with a target at $92.3.

The trade was unsuccessful, and the stock took me out with a stop after twenty seconds of my entry.

I knew it was not the right timing and my idea was still valid so I continued to follow the stock, after a few minutes the stock stopped at the $95 resistance level and continued to fall to $94, broke the level, and consolidated below it, I entered orders:

Entry: $94

Stop loss - $94.37

Take Profit Point - $93.27 (2:1 RRR) I identified a level after the losing trade from the pre-market and that is why $92.3 was not the take profit point.

6,6,6,"Jeff Bezos of Amazon sees a recession coming, and has said: ""Don't buy TV, fridge, hold onto your money.""","Amazon founder and billionaire entreprenuer Jeff Bezos has advised the American people to avoid large purchases such as new TVs, refrigerators or cars and “keep some dry powder on hand” during the coming holiday season as the US economy is likely to be in a recession soon, according to a report in the CNN.

The tycoon had last month tweeted to his followers “to batten down the hatches”. When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.

He said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession ""very soon"".

“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos told CNN. “Keep some dry powder on hand... Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”

“The economy does not look great right now,"" he said, adding, ""Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy"". ""The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon.""

The fourth richest person in the world said many people may be “feeling the pinch now” because of the extended economic downturn, but he appeared confident of a reverse in the trend in the coming time, saying as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future”.

Several other leading investors and analysts too have cautioned the American public about an impending recession. They have cited the Federal Reserve’s continuous efforts to curb inflation, which increased to a 40-year high of 9.1 per cent in June and remained at 7.7 percent until a month ago.

In the interview, Bezos also said that he will donate a majority of his $124 billion net worth to charities to fight climate change and growing social and political divisions.

""The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors. The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon. Take as much risk off the table as you can. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.""

""The probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.""

**2.** **Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter:**

""There's going to be probably a year or two of serious recession.""

""Frankly, the economic picture ahead is dire, especially for a company like ours that is so dependent on advertising in a challenging economic climate.""

**3.** **Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel:**

""For the Fed to truly conquer inflation here, we're going to put unemployment somewhere in the mid-4% range. I find it hard to believe we're not going to have a recession at that point in time, sometime in the middle to back half of 2023.""

**4.** **Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner and vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway:**

""I think the Fed is willing to have a little recession in order not to have out-of-control inflation. That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to be the one guy at the party that doesn't hang around the punch bowl getting drunk.""

**5.** **Carl Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises:**

""Whenever you have higher interest rates that have moved as they have here, you have an inverted yield curve, Treasuries at close to a 5% yield — you are going to have a recession. And I think we do have a recession already. There's a lot of things that have to happen to turn this economy around, to get us out of a recession.""

**6.** **Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan:**

""There's a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, companies are in very good shape. And there's a possibility of something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that.""

**7.** **David Solomon (AKA DJ SOL), CEO of Goldman Sachs:**

""Generally, when you find yourself in an economic scenario like this, where inflation is embedded, it's very hard to get out of it without a real economic slowdown. The US is most likely going to have a recession.""

**8.** **Jeff Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO:**

""Recession is easily 60% in the next six-to-eight months, and for the year 2023, I'd put it at more like 80%.""

**9.** **Leon Cooperman, CEO of Omega Advisors:**

""The combination of Fed tightening, quantitative tightening, a strong dollar, and the price of oil will create a recession in the second half of 2023. We've pulled forward demand because of very inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies, and ultimately a price is going to be paid.""

**10.** **Greg Jensen, co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates:**

""We are expecting a much bigger recession than the markets are expecting. 2023 will likely be the year of a very significant global recession.""

""You probably won't see the bottom of the equity markets until they begin easing, six to seven months from now. You probably won't see the end of the bottom of the economy for another nine months or so after that.""

**11.** **Nouriel Roubini, NYU Stern economist known as ""Dr. Doom"":**

""History suggests it's going to be near mission impossible to avoid a hard landing. You're going to get not only inflation, not only a recession, but what I call the 'Great Stagflationary Debt Crisis.' So it's much worse than the '70s, and it's probably as bad as during the Global Financial Crisis.""

**12.** **Ken Rogoff, Harvard economist:**

""You really have to look at the world, which is in bad shape. It's very hard for the United States to resist that. I worry that not only are we going to get a mild recession, I think the chances that we get a significant recession are really pretty high.""",z0eplx,250,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z0eplx/jeff_bezos_elon_musk_and_ken_griffin_are_sounding/,1668976991,11/20/2022 15:43,0.0

10,10,10,$QRTEA - Burry's Limited Downside with Unlimited Upside,"**TLDR:**$QRTEA with QVC, HSN is the leader in liveshopping which is more and more becoming a thing again through social media and streaming. The company is priced as if it were to go bankrupt, but it is not (Does that sound familiar to you?). Michael Burry bought a stake in Q3 2022. The company will either complete its turnaround or will be a takeover target before that at easily 3x the price it is now.

QRTEA is probably one of the greatest market distortions I have seen so far and I believe you will like it. This is a WSB-Play of the old days.

**QRTEA = QVC = Teleshopping is dead right?**

* Wrong.The company not only owns QVC, but also HSN and Zulily (yeah the e-commerce store where all those cute MILFS look for baby stuff).[Live shopping via Instagram or Streaming-TV is becoming a thing again](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2021/12/26/live-shopping--the-future-trend-of-e-commerce/?sh=7505d8c81b89)
* Revenues are pretty much constant at 14 bn USD since 4 years while the company has a market cap of 940m USD now. Wait what? You heard that right and it only gets better from here.
* [ROKU just partnered up with them to launch shopping events](https://advanced-television.com/2022/11/15/qvc-hsn-launch-shopping-experiences-on-the-roku-channel/) on their stream

***This ladies and gentleman is how the future soccer mom will buy her stuff: Liveshopping events on Prime, Netflix, Instagram (and ROKU).***

**Michael Burry steps in**

Michael Burry disclosed a stake in QRTEA on the 14th of November. It is his second largest holding. After Michael Burry revealed his stake the B – Shares were halted several times and rose almost 90%. They are up pre-market today again. They have a voting power of 10:1 compared to the A-Shares $QRTEA, but literally zero liquidity and a tiny float. I don't which of you regards is buying up those B-Shares, but get fucked when they 5x and you want to sell suddenly: it will all come down.

**Why would Burry do that?**

There are two aspects that turn the company into an undervalued cigar butt and at the same time give it the potential to become an absolute homerun:

**The Turnaround:**

The company is addressing its supply chain issues from a burnt-down fulfillment center. It is deleveraging its balance sheet by paying down debt and buying back some preferred shares and its turning around its business from a stagnating one into growth again.

\- Soumya Sriraman who led **Amazon’s Prime Video Channels Business** before proving that they are serious about the transformation to streaming

\-Scott Barnhart with Supply Chain experience at Aramark and Cardinal Health to fix the supply chain and rearrange the fulfillment centers.

**The Recession:**

* [The business will lose a few customers, but even in 2008 boomer moms kept buying like there was no recession.](https://www.gcimagazine.com/ingredients/regulatory/article/21847869/electronic-retailer-qvc-stays-recession-proof)
* It is priced in already

**The Icing on the Cake (Financials):**

* EBITDA during the last 5 years was around 1,5 bn USD
* Cash from Operations was always positive above 1 bn USD during the past years
* *Do not look at net income* – the company had a few impacts from e.g. its burnt-down fulfilment center and also impairments of goodwill on its brands which is a non-cash item and at this valuation truly I don’t give a fuck about goodwill, because it is priced like this business is about to die and it is going nowhere
* The company has 7bn in long-term debt
* Cash position of 600m USD roughly
* Interest payments amount to 300 / 400 m every year. Also, the maturing debt is becoming an issue as interest rates rise and it has to be renewed.

**Debt is Trading At A Discount And Can Be Retired**

Bonds and also the preferred stocks are currently trading at a discount of 20-50% to face value meaning that the company can retire its debt at a significant discount….I will leave that here so you can think about it for a second. It will become relevant in a minute. If you want to know how it works here is a good article from the WSJ in 2000:[Companies Buy Back Their Own Debt At Discounts With Short-Term Loans - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB976891532650088946)

&#x200B;

**Thesis:**

A company like Amazon could easily offer to buy QRTEA, get access to its brands and distribution channels and integrate them into Prime. The same applies for Netflix or any other media company.If the company manages the turnaround on its own then this will materialize during the next 2-3 years and the stock will probably be a 5x or more.

**The Math For A Buyout:**

All-Cash-Offer for Shareholders at 5,00 USD (conservative estimate) so give or take 2,5 bn USD (current price 2,20 USD). In the next step the debt can be retired at discounts. All in all 7,5-8 bn for an almost debt-free company that would cashflow you easily 1,5 – 2 bn USD yearly and you could integrate it into your supply chain plus the potential for growth and participation in live shopping markets. Does that sound like a deal?

The company is undervalued by any fucking ridiculous metric and buyout offer or not they should not be trading at 2 USD. I see the fair value somewhere around 5 – 6 USD. If they make the turnaround then this can easily go back to 15/20 USD.

**How To Play:**

The A Stock  $QRTEA – it is more liquid than the B Stock. The B Stock is currently squeezing, but it will crash down even harder once that is done.

Options all strikes 12 months out and roll them over accordingly.

Amazon rose 0.97% on Monday. Amazon is planning to cut about 10,000 jobs in its enterprise and technology divisions, with layoffs expected to begin as soon as this week. It would be the biggest job cut ever for the world's largest online retailer. People familiar with the matter said the cuts would be concentrated in Amazon's devices division, including its voice assistant Alexa. In addition, retail and human resources departments are also being targeted. On the technical side, AMZN is having MACD golden cross and formed an inside day yesterday. Friday’s high and low are two significant levels in the short-term.

The meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which took place in Bali a day before the start of the G20 summit, marked the first face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the two superpowers since Biden took office.

.

.

“We need to chart the right course for the China-U.S. relationship,” Xi said at the opening of the meeting in Mandarin, according to an official English translation broadcast. “We need to find the right direction for the bilateral relationship going forward and elevate the relationship.”

.

.

Biden said the two countries could manage their differences to prevent competition from turning into conflict. A White House readout of Biden’s remarks said that the two leaders spoke “candidly about their respective priorities and intentions across a range of issues.”

.

.

“President Biden explained that the United States will continue to compete vigorously with the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\], including by investing in sources of strength at home and aligning efforts with allies and partners around the world,” the readout said.

.

.

The US opposes any unilateral change to the current status by either side, and it is in the interest of the world to maintain peace and stability in Taiwan. Biden raised the US opposition to the coercive and increasingly assertive actions taken by the People's Republic of China against Taiwan, which undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Region and the broader region, and endanger global prosperity.""

18,18,18,"Another Huge Layoff Announced, This Time is Amazon. What Does This Mean in The Macroeconomic Picture?","Hey everyone,.

I want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.

I'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event.

20,20,20,"Amazon reportedly plans to lay off about 10,000 employees starting this week, would be the largest cuts in the company’s history.","Amazon is planning to lay off approximately 10,000 employees in corporate and technology roles beginning this week, according to a report from The New York Times.

Shares of Amazon were down about 2.5% on Monday.

The cuts would be the largest in the company’s history and would primarily impact Amazon’s devices organization, retail division and human resources, according to the report. The reported layoffs would represent less than 1% of Amazon’s global workforce and 3% of its corporate employees.

The report follows headcount reductions at other tech firms. Meta announced last week that it’s laying off more than 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, and Twitter laid off approximately half its workforce in the days following Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of the company.

Amazon reported 798,000 employees at the end of 2019 but had 1.6 million full- and part-time employees as of Dec. 31, 2021, a 102% increase. The New York Times said the total number of layoffs “remains fluid” and could change.

A representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The holiday shopping season is critical for Amazon, and usually, one where the company has increased its headcount to meet demand. But Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO in July 2021, has been in cost-cutting mode to preserve cash as the company confronts slowing sales and a gloomy global economy.

The company has already announced plans to freeze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business. In recent months, Amazon shut down its telehealth service, discontinued a quirky, video-calling projector for kids, closed all but one of its U.S. call centers, axed its roving delivery robot, shuttered underperforming brick-and-mortar chains, and is closing, canceling or delaying some new warehouse locations.

Amazon reported disappointing third-quarter earnings in October that spooked investors and caused shares to sink more than 13%. It marked the first time Amazon’s market cap fell below $1 trillion since April 2020, and the report was the second time this year that Amazon’s results have been enough to spark a double-digit percentage sell-off. The sell-off continued for days after the report and erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

[Headline MOM PPI](https://i.postimg.cc/BnZf3TPB/image.png)

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the change in the selling price of goods and services sold by producers. The PPI measures price change from the perspective of the seller. When producers pay more for goods and services, they are more likely to pass the higher costs to the consumer, so PPI is thought to be a leading indicator of consumer inflation.

24,24,24,Bear Market Rally: SPY 340 EOY,"We got TGT, WMT, HD earnings on Tuesday/Wednesday premarket. There is no way these guys don't issue a profit warning for the holiday quarter after AMZN cut guidance for Q4.

AMZN CEO:  ""We are seeing signs all around that, again, people's budgets are tight, inflation is still high, energy costs are an additional layer on top of that caused by other issues,"" he said. ""**We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period, like most companies**.""

That was 2 weeks ago, TGT is up 16% since then.

Amazon forecast net sales of between $140 billion and $148 billion, or growth as little as 2% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $155.2 billion.

Then on 11/10 in the midst of the rally everyone missed this nugget from Fed Daly

**""We will probably need to tighten more than the Sept. Fed forecasts suggested""**

[**https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220921.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220921.htm)

Median was calling for 4.6% fed funds rate by 2023, that's probably going to be raised to 5% or higher at the December FOMC.

Last bear market rally SPY peaked 8/15 at $430. By 9/30 the market was at $355, a 17% drop.

$400 11/14 to $340 by 12/30 would be a 15% drop in the exact same timeframe.

Retail is getting set up to get dumped on once again with an ""inflation peaked"" narrative.

Inflation may be coming down but the recession is just beginning, good luck regards.

Still **Long** some John Deere : and it's up again this week to 406.03

Carvana, I could not get myself to trade it as a physical stock purchase, It went to many times south and I would have been stopped out. and while I did look at the options, I could not pull the trigger also . what it taught me is that I have a system, it works based on some characteristics, and I'll stick to knowing that i can sleep well. 

Traded tqqq for a fast $50, again I am not cut out for short term day trading, Not even week long trading. I need to look for stuff that has 8 weeks to 2 years of holding time. 

So this came across my desk this morning. Amazon ( when it was coming down from 98.5 to 97.5 ) and I am crunching numbers. Did my math and analysis. Went **long** ( when Amazon was at 100 ) with **October 2023 145 calls @ 4.26** ( yep that's my trade, horrible fill ), I do expect that by 12/26 I should have a solid grasp of the probable outcome. looking to exit around 19 when it's trading 144-ish by march 7th ( 3 x risk reward ), and if the uptrend holds shoot for 25 ( 5x risk reward) by may 18th around the 160 price. 

Now speaking about Tesla, I think this Insulin Eli Lilly fake account thing in twitter will have a correlation issue   [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/)  Will lead to a freaking huge lawsuit against Elon's groups and team. The One key part of that legal landscape is **Section 230**, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content ( right from google search ) clearly states immunity. Here is the problem, someone was able to buy the blue check mark, without the quality control of the past, it's not so clear cut anymore. That's my new line of research. maybe a good long term put but the cost seems so high do to volatility that there is no meat on the bone.

26,26,26,BULLS LOOK AWAY: Highly regarded WSB legend Michael Burry is a full fledged bear through at least Q1 2023; Says market could fall to 15% below the COVID lows,"Intro:

I don’t know about you guys but I have a lot of respect for Michael Burry and his recession predictions. He has nailed them time and time again. He might be the smartest regarded investor known to man. He has been sounding the alarm about an inflationary crisis since as early as February 2021, and I believe that after the run up we had yesterday that it’s only a matter of time before we see a bunch of giant devil dicks all over our investing apps. I will detail some of his DD for his predictions.

1. 2022 Q3 Earnings

Earnings reports for big tech companies were shite in Q3. Microsoft’s growth slowed substantially, Amazon’s operating income got cut by almost half and reported their slowest revenue growth for AWS since they began reporting it in 2014, Meta Platforms revenues are down 4% and costs up 19%, Google’s revenue growth came in at just 6% compared to 41% 1 year earlier. Burry called this.

2. Disinflation is just temporary

Inflation appears in spikes. It resolves, fools people, and then comes back. After the first inflation spike, there tends to be a second larger one. An inflationary cycle generally spans years, and sometimes decades. It always comes back, just like us degenerates come back to YOLOing on FDs.


3. White collar employment bubble

When white collar employees are working remotely, they are unproductive. I work from home and can confirm I am a worthless sack of shit when working from home. I’m sure some of you can relate. This forces multiple employees to work a 1-man job. Burry thinks the white collar employment bubble is bursting right before our eyes and will lead to a huge increase in unemployment. We have already seen this taking effect with META, Amazon, Twitter (LOL) and other large companies having mass layoffs in the past month or two.

4. Margin bubble

Just like some of you dumb fucks who were inspired by the highly regarded legend of GUH, more investors are using margin now than ever. We are currently in the largest margin bubble in history. Also, plays are more risky. Single stock options volumes are now larger than the volumes for normal shares. Due to increased volatility from alternative investments, margin calls will occur easily. This dropped the asset prices, causing a chain reaction of margin calls. To make matters worse, credit card debt has exploded over the past 5 years to $4.6 billion. Goldman’s Apple Card lends more than a quarter of their credit loans to subprime borrowers. They will default soon once the bad credit regards fall to the rising inflation.

TLDR:

Burry believes the coming recession could be worse than 2008 and has been warning us since February 2021.

• Earnings for big tech were ass in 2022 Q3, worst is yet to come.
• We haven’t seen the peak of inflation just yet.
• White collar employment bubble from regarded unproductive employees, leading to more/continued layoffs
• Largest Margin bubble in history, produced by regards who can’t pay their credit cards and autists that use margin to YOLO on FDs.

Burry predicted the cryptocurrency crash, meme crash, SPAQ crash, 2000 crash, 2008 crash, and now the 2022 crash which is just getting started.

Although it dropped 1.82% during the first 5 min, TSLA then rally back to $195.85, breaking Tuesday’s high but failed to fill the breakaway gap on Tuesday. On the daily chart, TSLA made a new low for the last two years and broke the pivot point $179.83, which was the low on 03/05/2021. Currently TSLA’s RSI14 is at 24, traders can consider this as an oversold signal, but it depends on how you use the indicator.

[Amazon](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMZN/) fell 4.27% as Amazon Cloud Technology signed strategic cooperation agreements on innovation with Takeda Pharmaceutical and Accenture.

39,39,39,CLNE’s cow fart sales up 50% yoy,"Its always been a bit hard to take the CLNE investment thesis serious. I mean literally these guys capture cow farts and then turn them into transportation fuel to save the planet. WTF. 

But every quarter this company is making progress to make this crazy ludicrous business plan a reality. And there can be no denying anymore after this last quarter that CLNE is moving us closer and closer to a greener future.

Lets not kid ourselves. This has been a 15 year build. But rome was not built in a day. And after all these years CLNE today is the undisputed leader in not only RNG production but also RNG distribution. In other words CLNE is the only vertically integrated RNG play with both upstream and downstream business. 

The upstream business gets the most attention. Collecting cow farts is en vogue and all the major oil companies are talking about RNG. Not only talking. They are investing in this space and we now have seen multiple M&A transactions as everbody jockeys to buy renewable assets into their portfolios. 

But the downstream (distribution) business is the real gem. And CLNEs CEO acknowledged that yesterday officially:  

“No company is as well positioned as we are by owning and operating the largest fueling infrastructure in the country where the highest value of the RNG is captured.”

The simple fact is that the fueling infrastructure that CLNE owns (550 fueling stations) plus the trucking fleets it has signed agreements with (eg with Amazon) is very hard to replicate and nobody has this. Whoever owns this infrastructure controls distribution to the end customer (ie trucking fleets) and has leverage over the upstream RNG manufacturers. CLNE today is dependent on third party RNG because it can not collect cow farts fast enough but in the long term it will push its own product through to the customer. 

In the next 12 months expect revenues to ramp as Amazon deploys its fleet of 2000 trucks and other fleets convert to RNG.",yqsli0,9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yqsli0/clnes_cow_fart_sales_up_50_yoy/,1668021471,11/9/2022 14:17,-1.0

43,43,43,UBS says The S&P 500 could plunge another 16% and won't bottom until the Fed starts to cut interest rates.," 

* The S&P 500 will fall to 3,200 points before it hits a low in Q2 next year, UBS has forecast.
* US stocks won't recover until the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, the bank said.
* ""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" UBS strategists said.

The S&P 500 US stock index could fall another 16%, before bottoming out in nine months' time once the Federal Reserve switches away from hiking interest rates, UBS has forecast.

The Swiss bank's strategists laid out this scenario in a Monday note: ""Weak growth and earnings drag the market lower before a fall in rates helps it bottom at 3,200 in Q2 '23 and lifts it to 3,900 by end '23.""

The S&P 500 would have to fall 15.9% from its Monday close at 3,806 to reach that low level.

The benchmark index has already slumped 20.1% year-to-date, weighed down by the Fed's tightening campaign, recession fears, and poor third-quarter earnings performances by Big Techs like Amazon and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.

UBS expects a slowdown in economic growth to carry on dragging stocks down until the second quarter. It also projected year-on-year global GDP will rise just 2.1% in 2023 — which would be the third-lowest expansion in the past three decades.

""Our forecast approaches something akin to a 'global recession',"" a UBS team led by chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note to clients.

""For the US, we now expect near zero growth in both 2023 and 2024, and a recession to start in 2023,"" they added.

That economic slump would likely lead to a period of disinflation, they said. Given the US central bank has increased interest rates rapidly to try to tame inflation running at 40-year highs, that would give policymakers scope to switch to cutting rates to stimulate economic growth.

""Combined with inflation falling rapidly, the Fed would cut the federal funds rate down to 1.25% by early 2024,"" the strategists said. The rate is currently at 3.75%.

""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" they added.

Expectations of a Fed pivot could lift the S&P 500 to 3,900 points — a 2.4% gain from its close Monday – by the end of 2023, according to UBS.

The bank also predicted that future rate cuts will lead to 10-year US Treasury yields slipping 155 basis points to 2.65% and the dollar slowly falling the ten most heavily-traded currencies as well as gold.

46,46,46,I think PLTR is a buy.,"This is t a joke. I just think it's nuts so many people have disregarded the company due to the price drop.

For starters, at the time of posting this PLTR is at $6.99, so if that's not a buy signal, I don't know what is.

Second, both us government and commercial sides are growing. I've worked for the government and I can tell you that once they start working with someone they like, they stay with them for a while. The fact pltr is continuing to see big growth in government just proves they're establishing a powerful moat. The commercial side is also growing steadily, and will likely continue to increase as companies look for ways to become more financially efficient.

Third, the company is making money, increasing its cash position, and has zero debt. I know people will whine about gap profitability, but they'll only be able to do so until we do reach gaap profitability, which pltr has been inching closer to each quarter.

Finally, they're one of the few businesses experiencing strong growth in a recession. I know some might look at pltr and say the price dropped too fast. But they had an IPO literally before one of the largest tech bubbles in history.

And just remember, a lot of big gains are made over years. Amazon was trading for the price of a cup of iced coffee after the dot com crash and it exploded. AutoZone was trading for basically $10 in the 90s and was recently hovering around $2k a share. Don't be a doofus. 

Peter Lynch said it best, companies with no debt that are making money won't ever go bankrupt. We're about to head into the heat of a recession where a lot of companies are going to shrink big time and a lot probably won't be here in 2 years. I know pltr is down, but I also know it's one of the best stocks to get in to over the next few months. 

Also, to the VisualMod because I know you're reading this you piece of garbage--I am a bag holder who bought at $8 and this post might be a coping mechanism.",yoskjr,8,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yoskjr/i_think_pltr_is_a_buy/,1667839388,11/7/2022 11:43,-1.0

* You can also see that their revenue has increased due to advertising campaigns executed per client. This is why the stock pumped on last earnings.

48,48,48,$TTD is expensive trash and it will show this earnings.,"Intro: The Trade Desk (TTD) is an American multinational technology company that specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users. All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.

1). Massive competition 

As stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.


2). The premium is too high

They have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can’t produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can’t produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.

3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads

We are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.
 
4). The guidance nail in the coffin

Guidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.

5). Bull thesis

This is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind 

7) TL;DR

$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.

8). Position.

I have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday. Yolo, food stamps or Ferraris lol.

51,51,51,"Apple is now valued more than Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined"," 

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.

UPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

58,58,58,"Netflix ad tier debuts at 'a pivotal moment for the industry,' ad exec explains","Netflix's (NFLX) ad-supported tier officially arrives in the United States on Thursday.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

Based on me being 15% down on my position (7000 shares @ $4.02) and the 2 hours (maybe 1.5) of ""research"" I've done, I have concluded that this stock is underpriced.

The stock is reeling from the news that CVS has likely pulled a purchase offer, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that Humana $HUM is still looking to buy, always had right of first refusal, and is primed to purchase (still up 30% on the year). Both CVS and Humana are desperate to get more of that Medicare Advantage plan money and are basically fighting to buy the company. CVS reportedly stated in their conference call that they are still looking to get into primary care through acquisitions, and failed on their attempt to purchase One Medical who was instead bought by Amazon. Meaning the ""news"" of their pullout is likely bullshit to get $CANO back on sale for the institutions before the actual buyout. Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good). Analyst's lowest forecast is $4.04, still giving this an %18 upside worst case scenario and a buyout could reasonably drive this to $12 if not higher.

63,63,63,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

Lets flash back to last Friday… The beginning of of the week had a nice green two days followed by a doji Wednesday and a hammer candle on Thursday. This hammer candle showed downside potential and after hours did too. Then Friday came and out of no where ripped a 2.45% green day… Flash forward to this week its nearly an identical movement. I mean 100% identical. Scary at best. 

Today I am not too proud to admit I misplayed 100% and I unknowingly was far to bearish and bet against the markets. The worst part is… I even called this weekly rally last week in my weekly TA.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3a56ccw7mw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f85daeb5ea4b1cf9f4dac4f908e24f3738ffc38

Guess I should trust myself a little more huh? I definitely got blinded by the big tech earning misses, GDP coming in hot af, PCE/ PMI, job claims, etc etc etc. all of that was bearish af for the week. But what happened? Market didn’t care… why? Because the markets still believe JPOW is going to say on Wednesday at 230pm for FOMC (stay tuned this weekend I will release the FOMC trading plan to the server) that “we have inflation under control or we don’t wanna over shoot on rate hikes so we will look to slow down our hikes in December.”

This is why we are rallying in my opinion. 

So where does this leave us next week… well this is the scenarios I forsee. 

Monday and Tuesday I have pinned for a bullish because we really don’t have anything on the books negative wise. I don’t forsee anything economic or macro wise to really bring us down and its pretty clear by this weeks movements and recovery that bulls are in control and the markets is not going to sell off (I misplayed that today). 

Wednesday is FOMC day… I expect a green day. Now the question will be does JPOW rightfully say “we have not controlled inflation and while we do not want to overshoot rate hikes we need to slow inflation first” if he says this then we should look for a dump into CPI. However, if he says “I believe inflation is tamed and we will see the effects of that on the next CPI and going forward and that should allow us to slow our rate hikes… slow not pause…” we are going to rally. 

From there I honestly don’t forsee CPI coming in as a beat at all.. it actually is going to probably be a huge miss… if you remember back in August when CPI came in hot they held off on releasing the consensus (just like now) until we got very close to CPI… I have a feeling after or the day of FOMC we will see the consensus finally released. Which will allow me to accurately predict next CPI…   
 

Regardless of whether we rally or dump after FOMC I expect us to get a bad CPI reading and I will be looking for a repeat of August. What I think is happening is a tactful unwinding of the VIX prior to FOMC and CPI to avoid the crash once again. It seems like this is the general strategy that has happened time and time again. We get these rallies through bad news, and every dip is a buying opportunity where the technical make zero sense (such as this morning where VOLD was extreme bearish and nearly extreme bearish however we saw markets continue to rip). 

In short im bullish till Wednesday then we will take it from there… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/01m9slj18mw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f5350bfd176464416e90563b10fc4bd5ea7f493

In short SPY has maintained this red bull channel for 2 weeks now and until I see this bull channel broken I will remain bullish. I am seeing today we made a really nice double bottom off 379.8 which also was a daily 8ema support test and hold (this is the big play I over looked today with my bearish bias). In addition we put in a 2 day (almost 3) bullish engulfing daily candle. With maintaining and holding within this green channel and failing to retrace through it I am seeing that a 390.1 resistance test will be coming on Monday. The question is do we level up and push for the 400s before FOMC or do we reject that 390 level Monday and actually spend some time consolidating before FOMC. 

Fun note- this week is now the only the 2nd time this year that markets have put in a green week the week before FOMC the other time was July. 

If and when we break through 390 then I will be looking as the 50% retracement line of the bear channel and start eyeing 405.1 as next level resistance. I am not quite convinced that we will have the steam to get there but I do think we could take 395-400 before FOMC or on FOMC day (if jpow is bullish). 

However, if Monday we reject 390.1 channel resistance I would look for this red bull channel support to be tested and see if that 380 support holds. The one thing to note is that this is the first time a candle has closed over 388.6 since September 22nd.

Funny enough about this weekly candle is that this candle last night was showing a 100% different story. However, todays candle is our 2nd green week in a row and our first back to back green weeks since August. With this candle I look for continuation, however, we did fall just short of breaking through the weekly 20ema. We will need to take that level out then we can start looking at that next major level resistance of 408.9. 

If we double top of the weekly 20ema we could see a retracement back to that 375.6 weekly level. 

Key support- 385.2 -> 375.6 -> 363.7

Key resistance- 390 -> 399.8 -> 409.9

Futures put in a massive green day today and dead ended right at that 3925 level which just so happens to be its daily 100ema. On the bullish side of things you can see we held the daily 8ema as support today, reconfirmed 3800 as support and broke through the bear channel from August. There is no longer (besides the 2022 bear channel resistance) downward resistance to watch for. 

&#x200B;

Futures actually was able to close over the weekly 20ema. However, as you can see it fell just short of breaking through the orange channel level resistance of 3925. Next week we will look for futures to turn 3925 into support which should open up an opportunity for futes to test next level resistance around 4085. 

Key support- 3870 -> 3770 -> 3705

Key resistance- 3925 -> 4005 -> 4085

Apple put in one hell of an impressive day today making a total intraday movement of $9.68 which was 179% of its 10day average range. It also put in 175% of its 30day average volume today. People poured into Apple today. I think people found their “safe haven.”

Apple actually broke through its bull channels resistance and topped out right at 157.5 resistance today. With that being where apple hit and retraced we will look for that as key resistance to break over next week. 

This is the first time Apple has closed over the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema since September 12th. 

&#x200B;

Apple weekly played perfectly off the levels… for those who say TA don’t work or that you cant TA stuff when its parabolic… today even on a ridiculously big move Apple still respected levels. These chart levels were untouched and it closed right under that key 157.5 weekly level. 

With apple bounced off that red support line, holding 147.2 as support and closing over all the EMAs we should naturally look for some upside next week. 

Key support- 150.6 -> 147.3 -> 141.2

Key resistance- 155.8 -> 161.2

My love and hate relationship with Tesla is unmatched by anything else. Tesla provided me with 3 huge wins 3 days in a row, however, today I became too bearish and burnt myself playing some level to level plays. Now that I am being more objective I actually see a pretty bullish case for tesla next week. 

We came back down and tested the daily 8ema and managed to close back over that. However, we did fall just short of 230 resistance and the daily 20ema resistance. Tesla looked like it had no sense of direction today and that could have possibly been related to the twitter deal being completed today. 

With this hanging man candle on the daily I am looking for a repeat of 10/24/22 and will look to see a bigger push up on Tesla Monday/ next week. We are right at key resistance for the blue bear channel which lies at 228 for Monday. 

There is a case to be made as I mentioned earlier this week that tesla is establishing a consolidation channel from 205 to 230 and honestly until we close over 230 we haven’t officially broken that trend yet. 

&#x200B;

Tesla still has a daily and weekly gap at 262.47 to fill. I don’t forsee that filling next week but with a bullish enough sentiment and bullish enough FOMC its not out of the realm of possibilities. Bulls are not trading back over the weekly 50% bear channel retracement mark and will look to turn 2330 turn into support next week. 

Support -204.5 -> 191.7

Resistance- 245 -> 254.7

As I had mentioned I do believe we are seeing the VIX being unwound before FOMC and next CPI. Its generally bad juju to have it over 30 before such events happen. With us clearly trading under the key 28.4 and now under 27 I will look for a the VIX to be near 23.6 to 24.7 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

10% challenge- 

Overall despite finishing green today (bless up tesla) today was not a great day for me. I was too biased bearish and I couldn’t get a read on the technical today. VOLD (difference of buy/ sell on NYSE) is one of my biggest indicators and biggest check boxes for entering a trade. Today until about 1145am VOLD was not supporting any sort of rallying. IT actually was showing that a huge sell off should have occurred. This also put me overly bearish, however, the charge was led by SPY and tech today and by mid day NYSE jumped on board finally. From there I still took every rejection (consolidation) at key levels as a short opportunity and ended up missing out on some good bull plays. 

Cant win them all and no ones perfect but I look forward to a good weekend to reset my head and trade better next week. This has been a pretty tough 3 days to trade in my opinion. Monday and Tuesday were great though thankfully. 

My Apple put was toasted at open but took a nice win on that Amazon earnings play at open to recoup most of the loss… apparently I shoulda gone even more OTM as one of the 80s puts on Amazon paid 1k%+ at open.

I was able to record my most profitable week in two months and my most profitable week of the year. Which actually is more impressive being that im trading with ½ the position size still that I traded with from January to May.

I have gotten a lot of questions of “how did you go from 6 out of 8 weeks being red to 8 green weeks in a row? “How is it even possible to go from losing that much to winning like this now?” 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time… risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”

I say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover. 

I will make this into a dedicated reddit post and mention a few other things later too but wanted to bring this up here too!

* Apple stock surges, on pace for its best day since 2020
* Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.
* “Sometimes in-line results are most exciting,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.

If it holds until the close, it’ll be the best day for Apple shares since April 2020. Apple was the second-best-performing stock in the Dow Jones behind Intel on Friday.

The surge comes after a mixed week of Big Tech earnings, in which Meta and Alphabet

showed signs of weakness caused by macroeconomic conditions hurting the digital ad market. Alphabet rose less than 3% and Meta was up less than 1%.on Friday. Both took big hits earlier in the week.

Amazon fell 9% on Friday after giving weak guidance for the holiday quarter.

Although Apple signaled some slowing growth in the current quarter, and weakness in its profitable service business, analysts were generally positive about the company’s results.

Which turned into a beyond choppy and untradeable day. I wasn’t able to really trade a lot today as I had to learn before 10am to go pick my kid up who had a fever and was puking and was in and out most of the day with her being home sick.

Highlighted this yesterday on futures but im highlighting it today on SPY to make it even more clear. The blue arrows show what looks like a possible top on SPY which should lead to a sell off. I will be looking for an interaction with SPY at 378 support (now resistance after hours). This is the key level that separates the green and grey channels. A breakdown under this support and back into the green channel would signal to me a retest of 360s is coming before we reach 390 resistance. 

This will be the key pivot level to watch tomorrow. If we reject there in the morning or close back below that support of 378 (at this point we do have a gap to fill) then I will be looking for a further sell off next week leading into FOMC and with FOMC. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/siz07crkwew91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e192f0dd3fbbc96eb2a878a0d727f14768d0d3f3

I will touch on this more tomorrow in the weekly TA but overall SPY, Futures and Apple weekly charts are setting up for a massive failed breakout gravestone doji which should lead to a pretty nice sell off next week. The one caveat with this is that FOMC is next week and that can be a wild card for sure. If it wasn’t for FOMC id play puts for sure but I will sit cash most likely unless something looks really good. 

Key support- 378.8 -> 378 -> 374.3 -> 370.5

Key resistance- 380 -> 383.1

If you read last nights TA I said that futes most likely would go up and touch 3870 before it rejected just like happened back first week of October. That would then lead to a sell off and we would see a further sell off intraday. Well with this drop after hours its setting up perfectly to see the next leg down leading into FOMC next week. 

With that 3870 rejection and now sitting back under key 3805 support I would look for the 3600s before I look for 3900 again. 

Key support -3770 -> 3705 -> 3675

Key resistance- 3805 -> 3840

Well there it is… Apple missed on pretty much everything but china rev lol. So that’s not very good.. currently only down 4% after hours though. The golden boy lives! The call will be interesting for sure especially since they never give guidance anyways. 

Edit- apple BEAT on everything but china... that is fully my bad and i just can't read.

To be honest though earnings is a whole none issue for me. Apple today broke through key red bull channel support. This is the same channel that SPY and Futures are holding so far. I will look regardless of what happens for further downside next week. This could be the fuel that markets need to see Apple retest its 52week low finally. If and when that happens I will believe that the temporary bottom is in. 

Key support- 144.7 -> 142.8 -> 141.1

Key resistance- 148

And then there was tesla! So this is one that I am actually most excited about tomorrow at open. I think Tesla is poised for a really nice sell off tomorrow and next week. Tesla went on pretty much a 4 day bounce rally this week and established a super impressive rising wedge and bull channel. However, we say today that we broke out at open touching and rejecting key 234 resistance and then it dumped from there. If you caught that move it was one heck of nice win (granted not as nice as the call win yesterday). With this rising wedge broken I am looking to short tesla at open tomorrow most likely. I think if market remains are red as it is right now and Apple drops tomorrow and the rest of tech including SPY finally then we will see Tesla test that bull channel support. 

Tesla has established a really nice 230 to 205 consolidation channel. I am using the 230 area as a nice opportunity for puts and the 205 area for a nice opportunity for calls. 

Support- 219.2 -> 215.6

Resistance- 225 -> 230 -> 234

Besides the VIX being detached from reality the one thing I am looking at is that we bounced off that previous support of 27 today and closed with a dragonfly doji. This should result in a nice retracement tomorrow which should also result in a nice dump of SPY tomorrow. 

10% challenge- 

Well after an all around fucky day… just found out my daughter who I had to go pick up this morning during opening hours actually has the VID… my son who I picked up from school at normal time walked out with an ice pack on his head cause he fell off the swing and probs has a concussion… our household be falling apart I tell ya.

Intraday today didn’t get to play much. I ended up closing my level to level spy play EOD during PH cause I was supposed to leave to take my kid to the doctor… had I held that 1.6% win it would had hit 80% profits during that 15 minute drop after hours…

97,97,97,"10-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well today was one wild day that’s for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a “level to level” play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren’t stopping out too soon (this is why I didn’t chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key support- 381.6 -> 378.9 -> 378 -> 374.3

Key resistance- 385 -> 388.6 -> 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple…. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking.

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough.

Here is a little excerpt to kinda help explain it.

You know those little maps that say “you are here” when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak… apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover… its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -> 3805 -> 3770

Key resistance- 3875 -> 3925

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn’t very bullish… 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing… technically Tesla beat but missed revenue… its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before… But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don’t know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -> 147.3 -> 145.5

Key resistance- 150.9 -> 152.4

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today… So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -> 214.4 -> 209.9 -> 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -> 229.5 -> 234

&#x200B;

As if the VIX couldn’t become anymore detached from reality… we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers… however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That’s really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn’t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it’s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

Wish me luck…. Im hoping im not remind why I don’t do overnight swings and why I don’t play earnings at open tomorrow….

I browse this sub a ton and am seeing so many people making x1000 on earnings plays, so I know there's potential. But I also know that bad plays can make you lose everything.

I've been trading for about 6 months, but something happened recently which became the last straw for my gf. Her father is very supportive, and decided to pay for our trip to Greece (he gave us roughly $6k). In the end, we didn't use all of it. My gf insisted we give the rest back to her daddy, and I said it was the right play. However, AMZN was having its earnings and I didn't want to miss out. I thought we could make bank, give the remainder back to her father, and we could have a little extra for ourselves. So I used it all on AMZN calls. Went to 0 real quick.

So now my gf has been mad as hell at me, but why? Her father gave us that money to spend on our trip, he didn't expect to be getting any back. I was trying to do something good for all of us, and I happened to screw up. Now she's refusing to come over. I even drove over to her place with my guitar and tried to serenade her with an apology. She said that until I close my Robinhood account for good, she's done sleeping with me. I don't think that's fair.

What should I do? Can y'all have my back here?

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* $2k to $100k Challenge Update
* This week’s Earnings

Ok so let's get this show on the road

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

* Options pricing in a 13.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Every Healthcare company (hell even $TDOC) beat this quarter, taking some $152.5 Calls here Nov4 exp, IV is not too high

**Block Inc ($SQ)**

* Technology/Computer Software
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:00 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $.23 & Revenue $4.49B
* Options Activity ($100K+ Premium - 1 Month Out): You couldn’t really whose activity was dominating the list unless you counted them. The bullish activity, however, is in the lead with a 55.11%
* Options pricing in a 16.2% move on earnings
* My Play: Lots of bullish activity and lot of beats in the finance sector, going with $65 Nov11 Calls will likely hold till 1D 200MA is tested ($88) trimming on the way up

**After Close - Twilio ($TWLO)**

* Industrial Machinery/Components
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:00 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS:-$0.393 & Revenue 972.71M
* Options pricing in a 17% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is very bullish and alot of Growth companies that got crushed in the bear market have beat expectations ($SHOP, $PIN etc..) Going with Nov11 $76 calls, also will likely hold till 1D 200MA is tested  ($110) trimming on the way up

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

The analysts' rating of AAPL is trash. Only .58% returns in a year? What a rookie! Taking a deeper dive into their ratings and predictions, most of these gards put buy ratings at the top of a spike and right before the gay bears came to town!

&#x200B;

[Analysts Ratings of AMZN](https://preview.redd.it/aq47g54pydw91.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=538698b2223128eb11a6f9d7ebdcb8f48325f8bc)

It gets worse for AMZN! These gards are still giving advice when their track record for the past year is -30%!!!

The volumes and open interest of calls for AAPL and AMZN is also pretty high vs the volume and OI on puts!

154,154,193,AMZN is TWITCHING to IMPLODE,"Amazon earning are in 2 days. I am buying puts and here's why.

&#x200B;

1.) **Amazon-owned Twitch recently started taking more money from creator revenues** (Source:  [A Letter from Twitch President Dan Clancy on Subscription Revenue Shares | Twitch Blog](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2022/09/21/a-letter-from-twitch-president-dan-clancy-on-subscription-revenue-shares/) ) The days of being alive and unprofitable are over, and the numbers need to start looking better. This reminds me of when $NFLX raised their prices right before a historically terrible earnings call. I am expecting something similar this time as well. I think its simple that amazon needs more money and is cracking down on twitch to boost their numbers.

&#x200B;

2.) **Out of the blue Prime Day 2** (technically called Prime Early Access Sales but I call it prime day 2) Trying to get rid of excess inventory? Trying to pad sales numbers? I am not sure but it doesn't look good to me.  “Data suggests lighter sales than Prime Day event in July,” - BofA analyst Justin Post (Source:  [Amazon Prime Early Access Day Volume Drops 25%, But This Analyst Keeps The Faith: Here's Why (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/amazon-prime-early-access-day-volume-drops-25-25-but-this-analyst-keeps-the-faith-heres-why/ar-AA12Y7U7) )

&#x200B;

Other, smaller reasons

3.) **Strong dollar hurts international profits**. International profits make up more than 25% of Amazon's sales (Source:  [Amazon Percentage of International Sales 2002-2022 - Marketplace Pulse](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/stats/amazon/amazon-percentage-of-international-sales-13) ) and a strong dollar means less dollars when the foreign currency is changed back to dollars. Kind of priced in, but it's not a good thing nevertheless.

4.) **Weak economic outlook**. Now this we all sort of know by now, but interest rates have been rising, forecasts into 2023 look gloomy, and amazon is already trading at >100 PE. It just feels like a bad environment plain and simple.

&#x200B;

For these reasons and my desire to gamble, I am buying AMZN 105p 10/28

155,155,194,FAANG + Microsoft are all still a genuinely attractive buy to me,"Long story short I’m finding these 6 stocks to be very attractive currently for the following reasons: 

1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.

2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don’t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they’re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.

3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. 

I feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. 

Re: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they’re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. 

Hence, I feel there’s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind. They might get killed over the next 1-2-3 whatever years but I find them to offer solid and reliable value.

If we have good news it is likely that the technical rebound that started last week can continue but until we have some encouraging inflation data we will continue to be in a bear market. 

The most important thing is to reduce core inflation which is heavily influenced by the housing market. It is usually always the last to surrender.

159,159,198,Yahoo Finance Big Tech earnings and GDP data," 

Wall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market’s most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy’s health.

On the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) – which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&P 500 index – will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.

A bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

 

Earnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.

For this quarter, the number of S&P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.

Earnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn’t leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla’s revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.

&#x200B;

 

On Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.

Strength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback’s 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.

That headwind is expected to show up in Amazon’s results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate’s revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that “foreign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs"" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.

  

For Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted “demand has held up better than expected in recent months.”

Meta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech’s 72-hour earnings rollout.

In economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings – which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER’s panel of economists must officially declare a recession.

Economic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

 

According to Pantheon Economics’ Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.

“But the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,” Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",yc05jv,10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yc05jv/yahoo_finance_big_tech_earnings_and_gdp_data/,1666579616,10/23/2022 22:46,0.0

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

>Another day of big reversals on Wall Street, with stocks posting their best week since June after a treasury rout stalled. The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  
>  
>It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  
>  
>The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It’s important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It’s do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.
