0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FEW MILLION DOLLAR SHORT POSITION ON MARGIN. UPDATED POSITIONING.," Current positioning on my three largest accounts.  This rally is just another bear market rally in my opinion. \~ Max margined short right now.  Took over 3k CAD profit on $CMG short since the last post.

 TA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200-day MA SPY, FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \~3490, sentiment,  inversion of the yield curve, upcoming recession, risk-free rate changing, etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally (and tells me this is just a bear market rally). Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on. 

Watchlist for downside: 

$AAPL, $CAT, $TR, $DE, $GS, $DJIA, $NFLX, $CMG, etc.

Will be rotating shorts around to lock in profits, reduce risk, etc.

Will also likely be increasing margin as my positions move in my favor.

This is not financial advice, and I might have a little bit of autism.

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"My Full Plan for this Week 11/21 + Challenge Update (3 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event , 4 Stocks)","Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays.

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918**Port % Change**: 102%

We are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, i currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* SPXW 12/06/2022 4100.00 C
* TSLA 11/25/2022 180.00 C
* TWST 04/21/2023 25.00 P

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so they pulled the account value down, i got alot of time on most of these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on.

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much.

# Major Economic Events

**Wednesday 11/09**

8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct9:45 AM S&P PMI Flash Nov2:00 PM FOMC Minutes

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

# Earnings

# Monday 21 Nov

**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 & Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.

# Tue 22 Nov

**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.032 & Revenue $10.3B
* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings
* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell

# Wed 22 Nov

**Before Open - Deere & Company ($DE)**

* Industrial
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $7.12 & Revenue $13.5B
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.

Other notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

As of right now, I believe the bear market rally is coming to an end. Maybe there is a bit more upside, but I don't want to miss the downside. I personally like the risk-to-reward here.

My only long position is $ASTS right now, which I trimmed today bigly.

Universal Studios (UVV), like all Hollywood studios they are out of ideas. Its all about the nostalgiabait baby. The gen x’s had their time with stranger things but now its millenials turn. And what better thing to bring back than Jurassic Park Chaos Effect? Look man, we all know Jurassic World Dominion was a fat sack of shit but it grossed $2 billion dollars. It doesn’t matter if the movie respects cannon or makes endless plot holes. Its motherfuckin dinosaurs baby! Jurassic World and Camp Cretacious are done, son. I guarantee that Jurassic Park Chaos Effect is coming. Spielberg won’t cancel it this time; he doesnt care about art, only money. But UVV isnt even the half of it my friends.

I’m going balls out figuratively and metaphorically on DIS and NFLX. There is no shortage of Florida Man characters to put Hollywood back on top with interesting new celebrities. I myself am going to audition to be the next stay puffed marshmellow man in the next ghostbusters remake/reboot/sequel. I’m fat, pasty and white sticky stuff comes out of me.  But this is still not the money maker….

You google the top ten profitable industries during a recession; I will be a gator fuckin crack head if that list doesnt say fuckin toys! We going all in on calls this december for MAT and HAS. Every 90’s kid was so pissed off when Kenner unveiled the Ultimasaurus right before Spielberg cancelled the damn show. Half of damn youtube is people making their own Ultimasaurus from current Jurassic Park figures. When Universal and Spielberg finally gives the ok; this toy is going to make us Lambo driving millionaires. But thats still not all. We got Ron DeFuckme Santez on our side. He’s going to make sure the crotch goblins keep coming. More kids means more of a reason to make toys. The end of Roe is nigh motherfuckers!

I know in the next year I’m going to have 20 Ultimasaurus figures around me while I watch the next season of walking with dinosaurs.

In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

We  absolutely crushed it! So missed $TWLO that was a bad play, $TSLA never  ran to $250 but some profit was made there, if you got out early (i  didnt). And $NFLX & $PIN never triggered, so no play.

But earnings plays $CVNA $SQ $ROKU $ETSY $AMD (everyone thought this wouldnt run) $MRNA all were home runs.

Economic  events FOMC meeting went as planned too everyone said 75bps would sell  off, but it ran as expected, then we played the Speech as went along.

Watchlist, $DB, $SPY also played out as expected, so all in all good week!

# Major Economic Events

**Tuesday 11/08**

**Friday 11/11**

11:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment

Obviously  all these are important, but the only one we would be interested in  playing would be the CPI day. You can play CPI day 2 ways

**Option 1:**

Wait  for the results, after the initial drop or jump, the day usually  follows the same direction, you dont have to guess, and you would make  the ALOT of $$ by waiting it out and picking direction after that. If  you play same day options, chop might kill your plays anyway. This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.

**Option 2:**  
Speculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody’s chart  below.

https://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d

So  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)

So that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed’s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  ‘’influncers’’ would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.

The  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  
Remember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much. So play accordingly.

# Earnings

Monday 07 Nov

**After Close - Lyft Inc ($LYFT)**

* Transportation
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.069 & Revenue $1.056B
* Options pricing in a 18.6% move on earnings
* My  Play: Very bearish flow and $UBER earnings results were mixed too (ran  because of guidance & bookings), going with the flow here, they laid  off alot of employees not a great sign. Taking ATM puts today

Tue 08 Nov

**After Close - Affirm Holdings Inc ($AFRM)**

* Technology/Internet Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $-0.842 & Revenue $360M
* Options pricing in a 25% move on earnings
* My  Play: Almost all banks beat, $HOOD beat, $SOFI beat, very bullish flow,  im going with ATM calls for this one, corelation doesnt equal  causation, anything can happen, if you want to play safe you still make  ALOT of money with a straddle given the 25% implied move.

**After Close - Walt Disney Company ($DIS)**

* Consumer Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.554 & Revenue $21.3B
* Options pricing in a 8.3% move on earnings
* My  Play: Overly bullish flow, my gut says they miss with the $NFLX beat,  and China Park shutdown, but im going with flow on this one maybe there  is something i dont know.

Wed 09 Nov

**Before Open - Roblox Corpartion ($RBLX)**

* Technology/Packaged Software
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $-0.31 & Revenue $692.2 million

Thu 10 Nov

**Before Open - AstraZenca PLC ($AZN)**

* Health Care/Biotechnology
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS 0.758 & Revenue $10.78 billion
* Options pricing in a 5.2% move on earnings
* My  Play: Will probably end up skipping this, not a crazy move here as most  pharmas already reported, they almost all beat, so calls would be the  play here

# Watchlist

**- $AMD Long/Short**

**- $VIX Long**

Lot  of chatter lately about VIX big spike coming soon, while i personally  dont see it, the trend lines we drew 4 month ago, remain respected so my  play here, is if we break and hold $25.6 resistance ill take calls, if  that fails we are likely going back to retest the trend and likely break  it all the to $22 at which point i would take profits

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.

UPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

12,12,12,12,12,12,12,"Netflix ad tier debuts at 'a pivotal moment for the industry,' ad exec explains","Netflix's (NFLX) ad-supported tier officially arrives in the United States on Thursday.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

17,17,17,17,17,17,17,Zero Day Index options vs weekly stock options.," I tried posting this on r/options but no answers, there's just not enough degeneracy over there.

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

&#x200B;

1.) **Amazon-owned Twitch recently started taking more money from creator revenues** (Source:  [A Letter from Twitch President Dan Clancy on Subscription Revenue Shares | Twitch Blog](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2022/09/21/a-letter-from-twitch-president-dan-clancy-on-subscription-revenue-shares/) ) The days of being alive and unprofitable are over, and the numbers need to start looking better. This reminds me of when $NFLX raised their prices right before a historically terrible earnings call. I am expecting something similar this time as well. I think its simple that amazon needs more money and is cracking down on twitch to boost their numbers.

I am not sure but it doesn't look good to me.  “Data suggests lighter sales than Prime Day event in July,” - BofA analyst Justin Post (Source:  [Amazon Prime Early Access Day Volume Drops 25%, But This Analyst Keeps The Faith: Here's Why (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/amazon-prime-early-access-day-volume-drops-25-25-but-this-analyst-keeps-the-faith-heres-why/ar-AA12Y7U7) )

&#x200B;

Other, smaller reasons

3.) **Strong dollar hurts international profits**. International profits make up more than 25% of Amazon's sales (Source:  [Amazon Percentage of International Sales 2002-2022 - Marketplace Pulse](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/stats/amazon/amazon-percentage-of-international-sales-13) ) and a strong dollar means less dollars when the foreign currency is changed back to dollars. Kind of priced in, but it's not a good thing nevertheless.

4.) **Weak economic outlook**. Now this we all sort of know by now, but interest rates have been rising, forecasts into 2023 look gloomy, and amazon is already trading at >100 PE. It just feels like a bad environment plain and simple.

&#x200B;

For these reasons and my desire to gamble, I am buying AMZN 105p 10/28

34,34,34,34,34,34,34,"Netflix adds more than 2.4 million subscribers, reveals details about password-sharing crackdown","* Netflix beat third-quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines Tuesday.
* The company said it added 2.41 million net subscribers during the quarter, higher than the 1 million it had forecast.
* Netflix will begin to crack down on password sharing next year.

Netflix shares skyrocketed more than 14% after the bell Tuesday as the company posted better-than-expected results on the top and bottom lines. The streamer also reported the addition of 2.41 million net global subscribers, more than doubling the adds the company had projected a quarter ago.

Additionally, Netflix will begin to crack down on password sharing next year, opting to allow people who have been borrowing accounts to create their own. The company will also allow people sharing their accounts to create sub-accounts to pay for friends or family to use theirs.

Here are the results:

**EPS: $3.10 vs. $2.13 per share, according to Refinitiv.**

**Revenue: $7.93 billion vs. $7.837 billion, according to Refinitiv survey.**

Expected global paid net subscribers: Addition of 2.41 million subscribers vs. an addition of 1.09 million subscribers, according to StreetAccount estimates.

The majority of Netflix’s net subscriber growth during the quarter came from the Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for 1.43 million subscribers. The U.S.-Canada region had the smallest growth of Netflix’s regions, contributing just 100,000 net subscribers.

“We’re still not growing as fast as we’d like,” Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call. “We are building momentum, we are pleased with our progress, but we know we still have a lot more work to do.”

Netflix (NFLX) was up 10% in premarket trading after reporting better-than-expected earnings & revenue for Q3.

35,35,35,35,35,35,35,Were we all lied to ?,"We were told for the last six months that rates were going to hurt tech  stocks and as a result all tech stocks are now 50% to 70% off their  highs and the sector multiples are priced like slow growth value stocks  as a result.

Yet we see:

NFLX crush it .

We see NVDA sell out the new graphic card on day 1.

We see ASML crush it.

All  signs that the tech sector is performing exactly opposite of what we  were told again and again since the Fed started raising rates.

Last week we saw the entire market capitulate on a day when the VIX did not even turn green.

Today the VIX is lower.

The tech sector has been clawing back losses ever since the last week collapse.

I  think we are in the beginning of a new bull mkt for tech  ( or should  be) as the evidence is coming in to suggest the narrative that we have  been fed over and over again is flawed .

&#x200B;

 What we have is an oversold tech sector that has been heavily shorted on a falied narrative.   


Last weeks rebound is only the beginning of a reconciliation with reality .  


if we have a recession that is hurting tech please explain that to the buyers of the New 1599.oo RTX 4090 chip card from NVDA.

51,51,51,51,51,51,51,Netflix will charge $6.99 a month for new ad-supported plan starting Nov. 3 in U.S.," 

* Netflix is pricing its ad-supported service at $6.99 a month, which will be $1 less than Disney+ and Hulu with commercials.
* Commercials will be 15 or 30 seconds in length and will play before and during Netflix’s content.
* Netflix’s “Basic with ads” tier will include an average of four to five minutes of commercials and will have 720p resolution.

Netflix will charge $6.99 per month for its new advertising-supported tier, which the company will roll out in the U.S. on Nov. 3.

Netflix’s “Basic with ads” tier will include an average of four to five minutes of commercials each hour and won’t give users the ability to download movies and TV series. A limited number of TV series and movies will initially be unavailable due to licensing restrictions.

Ads will be 15 or 30 seconds in length and will play before and during Netflix’s content. Companies will have the ability to prevent ads from appearing on content they deem unsavory or unsuitable. To help advertisers understand its reach, ratings company Nielsen will use its standard digital audience measurement, Digital Ad Ratings, in the U.S. beginning in 2023.

Netflix is launching its first less-expensive plan with commercials after years of rejecting the concept. The move comes as subscriber growth has plateaued in recent quarters. Netflix lost subscribers in the first two quarters this year and expects to add just 1 million customers in the third quarter. The company has about 221 million subscribers globally, which makes it the largest worldwide streaming service.

Netflix will announce its third-quarter earnings after the market closes Tuesday and plans to unveil new subscriber and revenue forecasts, according to Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters. Netflix is partnering with Microsoft

62,62,62,62,62,62,62,PARA Short Squeeze?,"Is PARA setting up for a massive short squeeze? Short interest is above 11%, which is small potatoes compared to GME at the max, but other factors are in play.

First, PARA is a profitable, investment grade company that sells for .42 sales. PARA is priced like it's going out of business, but it's growing revenue. PARA trades insanely low due to hedge fund shorts, the other side of their long NFLX.

Second, Buffett might own 25% of float possibly, after this quarter of new lows. I'm guessing that 25% is the Buffett limit. He owned 25% of ABC Cap Cities. Buffett already had 13% at the end of last quarter. Between the shorts and Buffett, 24-36% of PARA shares are spoken for.

Third, PARA has about a couple of billion authorized for share buybacks. That we'll over 10% of the current market cap but call it 10%. So 34-46% of PARA shares would be spoken for if PARA did a share buyback.

The 11% that's short has no fundamental basis for the short. Moreover, with the slightest effort to buy back shares from PARA management, shorts might find a materially constrained supply of shares when they need to cover.

66,66,66,66,66,66,66,How to Win the Week of 9-26,"The market is retesting the lows (SPY 362.17), expect a bounce of some kind. Might be for an hour, a day, or a week, but a bounce is coming. 

**Why would the market bounce?** 

* Markets don't move in a straight line, we have been going straight down since the Fed meeting 
* Shorts are going to cover (if they didn't already in the last hour on Friday)
* People who bought puts in the last 3 days since Powells speech are going to close them for gains now that they got the down move and VIX is elevated 
* When people close out long puts, VIX comes down
* 3 day rule applies: the third day after the Fed meeting is Monday 9-26
* People say ""the market doesn't bottom on a Friday"" so expect another gap down at open or the June 17th lows to be tested early in the AM 
   * The dumb retail traders who are late will read the news over the weekend, and the fear sets in, so they sell on Monday (in theory)
* In the last hour of the day expect a rally as shorts cover and figure that the down move is at least over for now 
   * ""They"" are going to want to sell their puts while VIX is still high - or close their equity shorts before the other guy does 
   * Once one short covers, another short is going to want to cover as well before their gains are wiped out
   * We all know what a short squeeze is, right?
* Markets hate uncertainty, but the big event (Fed speech) is over now
   * Uncertainty has been reduced 
   * All the other central banks just finished a global coordinated rate hike - that is behind us now 
* No more Fed meetings until Nov 3rd. Pow has been hawkish 3 times in a row now, ""rumor"" is he has to be more dovish next time right? Aren't we feeling the pain now? 
   * Buy the rumor they say 
* Oil died so that feeds into the ""inflation is coming down narrative"" 
* The last CPI was a surprise because people were expecting a ""better"" number
   * Now everyone is scared and is expecting a ""worse"" number so any data that comes in not as bad as expected, will send the markets higher 
* Rates on the 2yr and 10yr have been on a straight up rally, so it is more likely they ""revert"" than continue (at least in the short term) 
* At some point the cash sitting on the sidelines comes back into the market 
   * Remember everyone that sold the last few days? They didn't buy bonds (check the rates), they didn't buy gold, they didn't really buy ""safe"" stocks either - they went to cash and they bought puts. Cash gets spent and puts get closed

**Look at this primitive cave painting I have prepared for you:**

[I made lines on a chart that confirm my bias](https://preview.redd.it/g26q3sdx1vp91.png?width=1307&format=png&auto=webp&s=6452399bac3693d8d7b3ff1267c2eb518011936f)

* Whenever RSI gets to these levels (orange circles), we get a major bounce
* The next trading range:
   * Spy 360 seems to be level we were fighting over in the past (red dashed line)
   * SPY 340 was peak before COVID (blue dashed line)
   * SPY 320 is the bottom of the level we were fighting over in the past (green dashed line) 
* The bear market range:
   * Red line = top of the range, good place to be selling 
   * Green line = bottom of the range, good place to be buying (or at least not selling) 

**Could we go lower?**

* The chart looks terrible, and all signs point to continued downside moves. 
* There is no ""macro"" reason why the selling would stop 
* The market hasn't completely priced in the current interest rate levels 
* The bond market doesn't seem to believe the Fed's projected terminal interest rate. Either the fed or the bond market will be wrong and change their opinion 
* Powell is in the bond market daily unwinding the balance sheet, that pushes up rates, and requires stock earnings to be further discounted 
* More companies could pre-announce downside revisions to earnings - FEDEX and Ford sent the market lower and more downside revisions are probably coming 
* Russia could use nukes 
* Natural disasters, food shortages and other macro issues continue to deteriorate and that will cause commodities to be in short supply, that means prices going up, which means inflation is going to go up 
* The dollar is strong and shows no signs of slowing down 
* Financial conditions are tightening and money supply is coming down - assets can't go up if money itself is going down 

**What should you do?**

* Don't buy calls: If you buy calls, and VIX comes down, you are not going to see the gains you expect, even if the market moves up. 
   * You will win on delta, lose on vega, lose on theta 
* Do sell puts: If you sell puts you get to win on three greeks: 
   * you win on delta, win on vega, win on theta 
   * give yourself 2 weeks of time to realize this bounce because it might not start for a few days if it doesn't start on Monday 
* If you like shares, then consider the tripple leveraged ETFs for a short term trade 
   * If you are capable of thinking past this week, get long on growth equities, but only get companies you can see being around still in 2 years (SHOP, NFLX, META)

Netflix's forthcoming ad-supported tier may cost between $7 and $9 per month, according to a report from Bloomberg. Netflix (NFLX) shares were higher Wednesday afternoon after a new report from The Wall Street Journal said the company expects its ad-supported streaming will reach 40M viewers next year. 

&#x200B;

By looking at the companies’ financial status, the companies’ ROE and ROA have improved in recent years. In the competitive streaming market, Netflix still has the most market share. With the 62% pullback this year, and the stock price stabilized after its FY22 Q2 earnings report, it is not a bad time to start to build the position in the stock.

&#x200B;

Warner Bros Discovery is a media-entertainment giant that has hit rough times lately, debt is concerning and they have not been profitable as of their last earnings report, but the company has some interesting numbers as of lately that could show it being severely undervalued. ( All sources for the information on the DD will be provided at the end of the post).

# Streaming and Box Office

&#x200B;

This year has been great for WBD in this area, movies like The Batman or Elvis have crushed the Box office and have posted great profits for WBD. In the case of Batman the budget was of 200 million and box office 770.8 million and in regards to Elvis budget was 85 million and box office gave 281.4 million. Special mentions to Fantastics beasts budget: 200 million box office: 405.2 million.

In regards with the streaming services of HBO MAX and Discovery+, how will they manage to merge them successfully is still unknown but separately they have posted great numbers, they ended 2021 with 73.8 million users and as of their last earnings call that number has grown to 92.1 million subscribers after adjusting for 10 million AT&T mobility subscribers. This has been shown on their quarter over quarter sales of 220%. This growth is much faster than any of the other companies in the industry (NFLX: 8.60%, DIS: 23.3%, PARA: 18.5%. Source: Finviz).

On the negative side WBD has had to scrap projects that didn't have good outlook like batgirl. This happened because they have to be picky when deciding what should go through because of their debt levels and protect their new DC movies that started successfully with Joker(2019) and The Batman (2022).

# WBD Gaming

&#x200B;

WBD has had a great hit with its latest release Multi-Versus. The game has raked up over 20 million players as of August 22, this can represent a massive cash cow since it is a free to play game which might bring more and more people as it keeps getting popular. This can generate huge gains via merchandise and in game cosmetics.

The gaming division is also scheduled to release Hogwarts legacy on the 10th of February of 2023, this shows a growing outlook and if the games are successful WBD might expand onto the growing market of gaming with some of their most knowledgeable franchises. This division of WBD has overall grown 4% in revenue against the previous quarter with the release of Leg0 Star Wars-Skywalker Saga.

# WBD Networks

&#x200B;

This division for WBD has grown 1% on their last quarter, and advertising revenues 2%. This growth has been explained because of strong sports and audience ratings. This sector is expected to slow growing due to the rise of the internet and unless they manage to get those services in there in some profitable way this sector of WBD might have some trouble, Zaslav seems to have a plan for this according to some interviews .

# Debt

&#x200B;

The largest issue for WBD is their debt, WBD has pushed the lever up to concerning points. Their debt to equity ratio is 1.02, this means that they have more debt than equity which is concerning, specially when going into a macro environment with higher interest rates which means WBD is not going to be able to refinance. The positive side is that when looking at their debt schedule is that their average maturity is 14 years which shows there is time to pay off debt and the interest they have to pay for this debt is mostly under 6% and for their larger bonds is less than 5%.

Zaslav has urged how important it is to reduce their debt levels and they have managed to reduce some of this debt during the latest quarters.

# Ratios and comparison with competitors.

&#x200B;

When comparing with their main competitors WBD seems to be growing faster and their valuation is much more conservative than Disney or Netflix for example. WBD forward p/e is of 11.45 which is a good ratio, their P/B ratio is of 0.58 which means that if you take WBD and sell it by parts you are getting more than what you are getting by market cap. Their P/S ratio is better than any of their competitors with the exception of paramount and in regards of their price/free cashflow WBD\`s is much better than the rest of the giants of the industry. The company that seems to be comparably undervalued by ratios on the sector is Paramount($PARA)

# What are insiders doing?

&#x200B;

Insiders have been consistently buying WBD which may hint at the company being undervalued, they have specially bought after the last dip after their earnings report.

# Conclusion

&#x200B;

If WBD manages to get their debt under control, their streaming servicies continue to grow at the same pace and the WBD gaming section is a success I see this company going long past the target price of 24.74$ per share, specially because the management has added compensation if the stock goes to certain levels in the next few years. I already own WBD and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years

85,85,85,85,85,85,85,Disney surpassed Netflix on subscribers. Do you think DIS will maintain its market leadership in streaming?," If Disney+’s subscriber growth is any indication, the rumors that the global streaming market is nearing saturation have been proven untrue.

On Wednesday, the Walt Disney Company reported that total Disney+ subscriptions rose to 152.1 million during the fiscal third quarter, higher than the 147 million analysts had forecast, according to StreetAccount.

At the end of the fiscal third quarter, Hulu had 46.2 million subscribers and ESPN+ had 22.8 million. Combined, Hulu, ESPN+ and Disney+ have over 221 million streaming subscribers. Netflix, long the leader in the streaming space, had 220 million subscribers, according to the most recent tally.

Disney shares rose more than 6% after the closing bell.

The streaming space has been in a state of upheaval in recent weeks, as Netflix disclosed another drop in subscribers and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a shift in content strategy. While Netflix expects subscriber growth to rebound, uncertainty has left analysts and investors wondering what the future holds for the wider industry.

Also Wednesday, the company unveiled a new pricing structure that incorporates an advertising-supported Disney+ as part of an effort to make its streaming business profitable.

During the fiscal third quarter Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ combined to lose $1.1 billion, reflecting the higher cost of content on the services. Disney’s average revenue per user for Disney+ also decreased by 5% in the quarter in the U.S. and Canada due to more customers taking cheaper multiproduct offerings.

Starting Dec. 8 in the U.S., Disney+ with commercials will be $7.99 per month — currently the price of Disney+ without ads. The price of ad-free Disney+ will rise 38% to $10.99 — a $3 per month increase.

88,88,88,88,88,88,88,$WBD is potentially undervalued," 

Let's start off with the obvious fundamental thesis: Streaming is no longer ""the future"", it is basically the present. traditional cable continues its slow decline and streaming platforms are continuing to grow.

Traditionally $DIS $NFLX and $AMZN are seen as the big players in this industry and most others are considered small-fry. This dynamic is clearly visible if you look at the market cap of the major players compared to $WBD. Obviously $AMZN and $DIS have some other revenue streams factoring in but $NFLX at least offers a compelling comparison. Netflix has 220 million subscribers after launching in 2007 with a corresponding current market cap of $101B. $WBD by comparison has 100.8 million subscribers (between HBO max and Discovery+) and a market cap of $38.8B. The ratio of subscribers to market cap isn't too far off here, but what I failed to mention previously is that both HBO max and Discovery+ are less than 3 years old and still growing fairly quickly, while Netflix subscriber count growth is starting to slow down as we have seen over the past few quarters.

$NFLX is trading at a 19.99 P/E. $WBD is trading at a 9.55 P/E ratio. This is IMO a pretty ridiculous gap. $NFLX has been floundering for months. Prices are increasing, they are adding advertising, their ""fast laughs"" feature and gaming endeavors are complete busts. Their product is suffering. I don't say these things to imply that $NFLX is going to 0, I think long term it will stabilize at near current P/E. Instead what I am saying is that it seems backwards to me that $WBD is trading at such a low P/E considering its potential. It appears undervalued.

To speak a bit to that potential: $WBD is quietly and efficiently improving their product, improving their library, and unifying their UX (probably Discovery+ and HBO Max will merge sometime in the next few years). Most importantly, unlike Netflix, $WBD is sitting on an absolute wealth of quality IP. They have also publicly stated that they plan to try and keep costs low as they scale. If management can execute on their plan $WBD can conceivably quickly catch up to and conceivably pass Netflix in subscriber count and in revenue over the next 3-6 years.

So, $WBD is currently undervalued, how best can one capitalize on this information?

Personally. I would recommend stock. I currently have a small stock position in $WBD and I plan to add to it after their ER later this week unless something deeply concerning pops up. The reason I am leaning away from options is because with the recent merger between WB and Discovery there could be significant short term costs reflected on this quarter's ER. Pairing that risk along with the potential that we are in bull trap, I am steering clear from playing this earnings. For those who really want to leverage up I would at least recommend leaps in case this ER is a dud. Analysts have a median price target of $25 but long term I expect us to break above current ATH's before the end of the decade. I'd be more aggressive about my timing but with macro conditions what they are it's hard to be too bullish at the moment.

Full disclosure of biases: I am long streaming. I hold positions in most US based streaming services.

90,90,90,90,90,90,90,My thoughts on NFLX and what's to come,"As we all know, Netflix stock ""soared"" after earnings. But compared to the gap up in 2018 and the gap down this year, I believe that the company needed to report exceptional guidance and a stellar report to get above the $226-$228. Though it is currently treading between this resistance and support at about $216, there is now a sizable gap to be filled on the way down as a result of ER. With everything happening next week, SNAP earnings being an indication that the ad market is lacking, SPY falling short of the $400 mark and going down after a decent week of earnings and performance from top companies, and the guidance that Netflix put out about new strategies, I think this is the temporary top line for NFLX and a lot of holdings incorporated in SPY.

Reported Loss of 970,000 versus loss of 2 million users expected","Netflix (NFLX) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close as the company battles ongoing inflationary pressures, increased competition, and an uptick in subscriber churn.

The streaming giant's Q2 subscriber numbers showed a narrower loss than expected, causing shares to surge more than 8% in after-hours trading. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share were mixed amid the broader subscriber slowdown, in addition to increased pressures from foreign exchange with the dollar holding strong relative to other currencies.

Here are Netflix's second quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg:

**Revenue: $7.97 billion versus $8.05 billion expected**

**Adj. earnings per share (EPS): $3.20 versus $2.98 expected**

**Subscribers: Loss of 970,000 versus loss of 2 million users expected**

The streaming giant's anticipated loss of 2 million paying users for the second quarter would have been the worst quarterly decline in the company's history after the streamer lost 200,000 users in April.

Netflix's Q3 subscriber guidance of 1 million came in below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 1.9 million, although analysts have admitted that the second half of the year could see potential downside risks amid macroeconomic concerns.
