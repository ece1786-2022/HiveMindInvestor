3,3,3.0,Apple and Elon Musk’s Twitter are on a collision course," 

* **Musk wants to vastly increase the amount of money the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more “free speech.”**
* **This creates a risk that Twitter could violate Apple or Google’s app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.**
* **Battle lines are being drawn. Last week, Musk complained about app store fees, which are between 15% and 30% of digital sales, in a tweet.**

 Elon Musk has announced big, albeit confusing, plans for Twitter since he took over the social network last month.

Musk wants to vastly increase the revenue the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more “free speech,” which in some cases seems to mean restoring previously banned accounts like the one owned by former president Donald Trump.

But Musk’s plans for Twitter could put it in conflict with two of the biggest tech companies: Apple and Google.

## Tensions are brewing

One of the biggest risks to Musk’s vision for “Twitter 2.0” is the possibility that his changes violate Apple or Google’s app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.

Tensions are already brewing. Musk complained in a tweet just last week about app store fees that Google and Apple charge companies like Twitter.

“App store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly,” Musk tweeted. “It is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.” In a follow-up post, he tagged the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, which is reportedly investigating app store rules.

His complaint is over the 15% to 30% cut Apple and Google take from purchases made inside apps, which could eat into the desperately-needed revenue from Musk’s plans for $8 per month from Twitter Blue subscriptions.

Over the weekend, Phil Schiller, the former head Apple marketing executive who still oversees the App Store, apparently deleted his widely-followed Twitter account with hundreds of thousands of followers.

The US producer price index (PPI) rose less than expected in October, both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis, clearly showing the broader trend of slowing inflation growth in the US and increasing the likelihood that the Fed will slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

Semiconductor and software Platforms were among the top gainers, while technology companies mostly gained, with Google, NVidia, and Meta Platforms up more than 2% and Apple and Tesla up more than 1%.

SEA rose 36.05% as Q3 revenue beat expectations, the loss was much lower than consensus, and it cut full-year booking guidance to US $2.6 billion to US $2.8 billion from US $2.9 billion to US $3.1 billion; 7,000 jobs, or 10% of the workforce, have been cut in the past six months. Tencent Music rose 30.56 percent as overall results solidly beat expectations, with paying online music users growing 19.8 percent year on year to a record 85.3 million.

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

&#x200B;

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.73**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.57**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.25%**|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Growth Rate Estimate with market risk|12.68%|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-3.60%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|\-20.92%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,127,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

note: EPS is the EPS of last month, this is to compare the company in that time period to today's macro data.

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|12.68|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**

&#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.25%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|12.68%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,127,000,000|

This gives us a fair value of **$46.50**

&#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|**$41.05**|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|**$75.98**|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|**$46.50**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$32.71**|

Note:  In the evaluation, the price took in  mind discounted dividends model and total payout model, which both give  an evaluation of $0 due to the fact that growth rate is higher than the  discount rate. So the average takes in count the three methods above plus the two zeros

The company pays dividends so in this case i priced in also the output of those two models too

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC – Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX – Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI – Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG – Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS – Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&E

# Revenue Forecast

With the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 12.86%

## Analysts Price Target

**$72 High**

**$32.74 Average**

**$18 Low**

**$32.71 OP’s**

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

The cooldown of infration migh suggest a better economic landscape for 2023

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $32.71.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

16,16,16.0,Apple plans to source chips from Arizona plant that’s set to open in 2024: report," 

[Bloomberg News reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-15/apple-prepares-to-get-made-in-us-chips-in-pivot-from-asia-supply?srnd=premium&sref=Oeyjq8by) Tuesday that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook recently said during an internal meeting in Germany that the tech giant is preparing to buy chips from “a plant in Arizona,” which is expected to go online in 2024. Cook reportedly added that Apple will likely buy more European-made chips as well.

That’s all in an effort to reduce its reliance on chip manufacturing from Asia, which has been plagued by COVID-19 and shipping disruptions in recent years. Apple has been working to remake its supply chain, with dozens of its parts suppliers [adding manufacturing facilities in the U.S.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-suppliers-add-manufacturing-sites-in-u-s-with-focus-on-california-11664912415?mod=article_inline) in fiscal 2021, according to a supplier list released by Apple in October.

The Arizona plant Cook referred to is likely [the $12 billion facility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-12-billion-chip-factory-in-arizona-2020-05-15?mod=article_inline) north of Phoenix being built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which was announced in 2020. TSMC is the world’s largest contract manufacturer of silicon chips and is Apple’s chip-making partner.

Last week, [the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-making-juggernaut-tsmc-eyes-multibillion-dollar-arizona-factory-expansion-11667973859?mod=article_inline) TSMC would expand that facility, which could serve as a second manufacturing plant.

17,17,17.0,"11-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Going to shy away from further TA on Apple. For me personally I don’t focus on it much anymore and I just don’t want to waste my resources on it when I have had a much higher success rate with Tesla and of course my GOAT SPY. 

Today we saw yet again another massive sell off. I am trying to decide if markets are truly that over extended that anything will cause a dump or if we are just getting truly rogue new waves causing a dump. The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now… it sure shows signs it doesn’t want to stay there. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfq05cbxt70a1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bceb8d88dc64a122111ae099429909bfb085c4f

The one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland “incident” is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. 

Now SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is… did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.

Support- 398.5 (key pivot point) -> 395 -> 393 -> 390.1

Resistance- 401.9 -> 405.3

Looking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. 

Futures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965. 

Support- 3965 -> 3925 -> 3900

Resistance- 4002 -> 4027 -> 4060

Tesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation. 

Support- 190.8 -> 185.7 -> 177.4

Resistance- 196.1 -> 201 -> 204.9

We did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn’t take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren’t that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC. 

There still is a very real scenario where JPOW says 50 bps hike and hints at another 50bps next meeting in January. On top of that there is nothing saying after 5 consecutive decreases on the CPI YoY readings that we don’t get a rogue spike in CPI YoY that sends the markets tumbling. At this point with the markets now expecting a beat on CPI any miss is going to get bloody… like historically bloody type of days…

Good day today. I was busy with my daughter and her birthday most of the morning so I wasn’t around to trade until about 1230… hit that morning put scalp on SPX before I left. I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don’t enjoy trading much and I also don’t trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play.

I am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don’t know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn’t even a missile… we probably will never know the truth. 

I did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. 

That’s the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of “are you going to take profits at open?” “you going to take your loss at open?” and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn’t about to play out.

18,18,18.0,"Buffett may have invested in TSMC too early, analyst says, predicting the best time to buy","Legendary investor Warren Buffett may have overpaid for his latest investment in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor, according to one equity analyst.

This could also be good news for those following in the footsteps of the “Oracle of Omaha” though, as it gives investors another opportunity to buy the stock.

Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought more than 60 million shares of TSMC worth $4.1 billion (1.2% of TSM) in the third quarter, according to a [quarterly regulatory filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000095012322012275/xslForm13F_X01/18337.xml). New York-listed shares in the chip stock rose 5.8% in after-hours trading to $77.08.

“What’s interesting about it is he kind of got in early on this trade,” John Blank, chief equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told CNBC early Tuesday. “I would have probably waited for $50 or $60 on the shares like this, because you’ve got enough downside pressure on that stock.”

Chip stocks have sold off this year, with the iShares and VanEck Semiconductor ETFs down by about 30%. TSMC has also declined by almost 40% over the year to date.

Blank said Buffett, 92, was not as interested in buying the bottom as other investors, given Berkshire Hathaway’s long-term investment horizon.

“He just decides: ’I have got the foundation stock of the chip business globally on sale, and I simply don’t care to buy the bottom,” Blank said of Buffett’s thinking on the investment.

TSMC is the smallest of Buffett’s top 10 holdings and is the second-largest tech allocation following his investment in Apple – the largest holding in Berkshire.

Bank of America analysts said in a note to clients last week that the semiconductor sector is likely to rebound in the second half of 2023.

The Wall Street bank’s analysts also said that chipmakers’ high profitability, a high entry barrier for new competitors, and dependence on chips for growth in the electric car and robotics sectors make a convincing argument for investing in chip stocks.

The median price target of 30 analysts covering TSMC indicates a 29.8% potential upside from its share price prior to Buffett’s investment, according to FactSet.

SPY went on a super impressive breakout back to 400 only to get absolutely smacked down. This was actually a super bearish close today and shows a local top in my opinion. It will take some big strength to push through 400 that is for sure. 

With this black bull channel we actually have a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow. Not sure exactly how low we will go but until we can break through and close over 400 there is not a reason to expect further upside.

Identical pattern on futures right now too… we actually came close enough on Futures to the daily 200ema to call that a daily 200ema rejection and again with these gravestone doji candles I expect this to be the local top and to see a back test of some stronger support levels like 390/ 3905 before we have a fighting chance of continuing up.

Apple ran right into its daily 100ema today, however, found itself running into a brick wall and has now retraced pretty significantly.

However, we could hard reject and retrace instead.

Tesla attempted once again to break out over its daily ema and break out of this falling wedge on the daily however was once again unsuccessful. I had said last week that the 196.1 double top was in play and it sure was today. With this doji I do expect some downside tomorrow. IT did however find itself holding key support of 190.9 EOD. I will look for that support to break tomorrow and test the blue support line at 188. If we lose that support I am looking for 177.4 support retest this week. However, if we can hold support and finally take out the daily 8ema and 196.1 then we can look for the gap fill and possibly a bigger push towards 208.8 resistance.

Lots of movement on the VIX today. Had a nice 6% green open that led to a hard sell off under that key 23.5 range. However, still not exactly sure what caused it but EOD we had a pretty big spike of the VIX that put it back over 23.5 and caused it to close its biggest green day since October 6th.

Lets start with the FG index which I did talk about earlier this week on Monday we were only at 61 and we have now jumped up to 66. As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. 

I wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. 

January the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  
 April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   
 August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.

That means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at 401.6 and find out rejection point there. This actually is exactly where we rejected in august on the dead cat bounce. 

This COULD give us a trajectory of about 339.4 sometime between December 1st and December 20th. However, my one caveat here is the million dollar question “what would the catalyst for such a drop be?” Earnings is over, no cpi/ fomc until December 13th/ 14th and more or less there isn’t much I can for see that could panic people enough to sell that intensely. 

So if we break the trend and we let the FG index run hotter than usual the next question is “where are we going? How high are we going to go?”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0byl8v7iez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6526517148b713a6e8f9d5b1479a461453f70ef4

Looking at the daily chart I see a bull and a bear case. Bull case would be that we push minimally to the 200ema at 401.6. If we can CLOSE a daily candle over that 200ema then I have no doubt next week we could test 405.4 channel resistance and we very well could end up testing that bigger solid green resistance line for the overall 2022 bear channel. This resistance on Friday is 410.8. 

However, if we either reject the 200ema or from here here double top and see downside the first stop is going to be 390. This is the level that bulls need to defend. If they lose 390 then we are looking at a pretty convincing minimally partial gap fill to 381.14. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rkrafse8iez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf2c3a225eaf8f4605823c4dae5e1717f1881da

Now if we flip over to the weekly view things become a little more clear. We dead stopped into the weekly 100ema today and couldn’t break through that. We have a nice blue bull channel formed here and a pretty mild black rising wedge also. 

Next weeks key resistance comes in at 399.5. This will be our pivot point. Break out over it and hold that as support through the week and we are looking at a test of the WEEKLY bear channel resistance at 412.7 next week. However, if we reject and form a double top here at the weekly 100ema we could be looking for that backtest of 390. Same with the daily if we lose 390 then we will look for a bigger retrace. 

I am pretty indifferent here in the fact that I don’t see a catalyst to make people want to sell at these levels. Most investors are probs thinking “bottoms in” and they don’t wanna miss the next bull run. It will take a lot to convince them to sell. However, Spy just put its greenest week in since the week of June 21st. There definitely could be at minimum some profit taking and with the VIX unwinding we could see some people start hedging for next CPI/ FOMC. 

For me I wouldn’t take a long here but I feel until we touch the 200ema its too early to start a put position.  

Key support- 390 -> 375.8

Key resistance- 399.5 -> 409

Similar case here on the Futures daily we haven’t quite touched that key 200ema yet which is the gateway for the next big run up or the potential for the next top.

When we look at futures weekly chart you can see this is actually a true weekly bullish engulfing candle. This should provide some upside for next week from a technical standpoint. However, we need to take out that weekly 100ema first. We are also well above that 3870 JPM collar call too. 

Support- 3915 -> 3770 -> 3705

Resistance- 4000 -> 4085 -> 4152 (bear market resistance… 3.8% from close)

Apple put that 135 support in this week and from here this thing has never looked back. I believe it will test that bear channel resistance next week. Apple fell just short of its 100ema and 200ema this week which as I have mentioned before on Apple is always a period of consolidation.

The weekly on Apple actually is still trading within an overall bear channel. That resistance comes in at 151.9 next week. If we see Apple break through that level then it has broken its bear channel and we can look for further upside. Apple did close back over its 8ema but fell just short of its 20/50ema. 

Key support- 147.2 -> 141.3 -> 138.2

Key resistance- 150.5 -> 151.9 -> 155.8

Tesla mostly due to its sporadic movement the last few weeks has quite a few things set up on it. It has the bigger red falling wedge formed on it that has a tighter falling wedge with that black resistance line within it. There is also a potential recovery support line highlighted in blue. 

Tesla did come up today and get near the daily 8ema but failed to close over it today it also came within 14 cents from the November 7th 196.66 gap fill. I am keeping an eye out for a double top Monday at the daily 8ema which also would coincide with the back resistance line at 196.8. As long as we hold under that resistance line there should be downside expected. However, once we break through that resistance then I would expect a test of possibly the daily 20ema (especially if the markets remain bullish).

I actually remain bearish on tesla, however, looking at the weekly it broke under the weekly 200ema as I had said for the first time in 3 years, however, it popped and closed over it. With this huge hanging man candle here there actually is a pretty solid case for upside next week. The weekly bear channel resistance will be 211.1 and will also be the weekly 8ema. 

Key support- 195.8 -> 177.8 -> 167.9

Key resistance- 207.3 -> 228.6

The VIX has now closed below 23.5 support for the first time since the days before the September CPI reading. This also is the lowest reading the VIX has closed at since August 26th which was Jackson Hole. 

This kinda goes even further to prove my point that I don’t see a bearish catalyst for this market. IF we look at the last two times the VIX was at these levels there was bearish catalysts that pushed it back up. Jackson hole and then CPI. But with no big fed events, no cpi and no FOMC for another month what is going to be the catalyst? What is going to be the reason the VIX wants to spike? 

There might not be one for the next month. If there is no catalyst we might be looking at the VIX going back to that support line from the August low at 19.7. For me this is where we open a longer 30-60dte put position. We are in no mans land right now. Going short is fighting the trend but going long on calls feels like we are buying the absolutely top. 

Remember guys… CASH is a position! We don’t always have to be long. We can be cash over night. We can play some short 7-14 dte plays and wait for the next top/ bottom to more clearly present itself.

I will do weekly updates on this but also include it in my daily log. The general idea here is I will be using $5,000 for ONE trade per day.. the goal is 10% profits BUT a hard set -20% stop loss. We will see where this takes us and if we can make one trade a day for about 10% profitable or not. On the right side you can see I broke it down in an equivalent had you used a smaller account instead of my $5,000.

Overall this was a pretty great week. My most profitable week ever I believe and I also secured my biggest win ever this week with that CPI play. However, I recognize while that was a high probability play… if I was wrong and we opened flat I woulda closed my week out red. 

I also made some mistakes this week. I let a few of my level to level puts run way too long and pass my 25% stop loss. Still a struggle but letting the SPY put from yesterday run to today for -82.32% and taking a bigger -60%+ loss on Tesla earlier in the week really hit me hard. 

This week I absolutely KILLED it on scalps hitting 95% win rate and a nice $4,889. I had mentioned last week and earlier this week whether or not tesla plays were worth it or not. In review you can see that my win rate was much lower on them, however, profitability wise I actually was very successful. Something some fail to remember is that win rate doesn’t always equal profits. For this week low win rate still netted profits. 

I am always learning and always critiquing my strategy. I will continue to monitor my L2Ls and see how next week shapes up.

25,25,25.0,BULLS LOOK AWAY: Highly regarded WSB legend Michael Burry is a full fledged bear through at least Q1 2023; Says market could fall to 15% below the COVID lows,"Intro:

I don’t know about you guys but I have a lot of respect for Michael Burry and his recession predictions. He has nailed them time and time again. He might be the smartest regarded investor known to man. He has been sounding the alarm about an inflationary crisis since as early as February 2021, and I believe that after the run up we had yesterday that it’s only a matter of time before we see a bunch of giant devil dicks all over our investing apps. I will detail some of his DD for his predictions.

1. 2022 Q3 Earnings

Earnings reports for big tech companies were shite in Q3. Microsoft’s growth slowed substantially, Amazon’s operating income got cut by almost half and reported their slowest revenue growth for AWS since they began reporting it in 2014, Meta Platforms revenues are down 4% and costs up 19%, Google’s revenue growth came in at just 6% compared to 41% 1 year earlier. Burry called this.

2. Disinflation is just temporary

Inflation appears in spikes. It resolves, fools people, and then comes back. After the first inflation spike, there tends to be a second larger one. An inflationary cycle generally spans years, and sometimes decades. It always comes back, just like us degenerates come back to YOLOing on FDs.


3. White collar employment bubble

When white collar employees are working remotely, they are unproductive. I work from home and can confirm I am a worthless sack of shit when working from home. I’m sure some of you can relate. This forces multiple employees to work a 1-man job. Burry thinks the white collar employment bubble is bursting right before our eyes and will lead to a huge increase in unemployment. We have already seen this taking effect with META, Amazon, Twitter (LOL) and other large companies having mass layoffs in the past month or two.

4. Margin bubble

Just like some of you dumb fucks who were inspired by the highly regarded legend of GUH, more investors are using margin now than ever. We are currently in the largest margin bubble in history. Also, plays are more risky. Single stock options volumes are now larger than the volumes for normal shares. Due to increased volatility from alternative investments, margin calls will occur easily. This dropped the asset prices, causing a chain reaction of margin calls. To make matters worse, credit card debt has exploded over the past 5 years to $4.6 billion. Goldman’s Apple Card lends more than a quarter of their credit loans to subprime borrowers. They will default soon once the bad credit regards fall to the rising inflation.

TLDR:

Burry believes the coming recession could be worse than 2008 and has been warning us since February 2021.

• Earnings for big tech were ass in 2022 Q3, worst is yet to come.
• We haven’t seen the peak of inflation just yet.
• White collar employment bubble from regarded unproductive employees, leading to more/continued layoffs
• Largest Margin bubble in history, produced by regards who can’t pay their credit cards and autists that use margin to YOLO on FDs.

Burry predicted the cryptocurrency crash, meme crash, SPAQ crash, 2000 crash, 2008 crash, and now the 2022 crash which is just getting started.

A beat on CPI actually makes trading SPY for the next month even harder then a miss. Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI “came down” we have to deal with yet again the “fed pivot/ slowing” news media cycles hitting the tapes. 

Overall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode.

SPY just made yet again market history… today was the 3rd largest daily point gain in market history, the 2nd largest intraday points swing, and the largest daily percent change this year (bear or bull). This was the largest green close since march 23rd 2009 which closed up 7.08%. 

What an incredible and unbelievable day.

We impressively broke through the daily rising wedge support last night at market close (now that makes a new support) and today we just touched and held the resistance of that same rising wedge. That is one hell of a swing and I cant even believe it myself. We also went from close in the bear channel to now closing in the purple channel completely skipping the green channel close. 

If the market is being rational it is going to come down and at least test 390 purple channel support. There could be a case for it to come all the way down to 384 or even 381.1 to gap fill. However, with the extreme volume on VOLD today and just the overall momentum I wouldn’t be surprised (despite it being illogical) to see tomorrow be yet another big green day. 

Support- 393 -> 390 -> 388 -> 384 -> 381.1

Resistance- 397.9 -> 402 (daily 200ema) 

Something I would like to point out is that this day is very similar to May 4th on SPY. That was a FOMC day that went on a similar insane rip EOD and end up with a flat top daily candle much like SPYS today. That day resulted in a massive drop the next day. Something interesting about this also is that the VIX put its biggest drop of the year in since May 4th today also. Tomorrow will be interesting to say the least.

Weekly chart wise you can see we are still in this bull channel withing the green 2022 bear channel. Resistance of this channel is 397.6 (this is a potential place we could pop to tomorrow before retracing). We also have a rising wedge inside this bull channel to keep an eye on too. Next week 2022 bear channel resistance comes in at 412.7. We break that and effectively bear market is “over.” Technical wise.

One of the single most impressive daily candles ive ever seen on Futures. It didn’t quite make it to 3975 resistance but we very well overnight may touch it.

Futures weekly setting up very similarly looking at the bull channel within the 2022 green bear channel with a rising wedge within that bull channel. 

4000 is the weekly 100ema and also the bull channel resistance for this week.

Apple with an impressive day closing up 8.9%. which is incredible. I don’t have the same data easily available on apple as I do spy but im sure since covid 2020 this is its and most of techs biggest closure. 

Apple broke through that red bear channel and actually closed over the daily 8, and 20ema falling just short of the daily 50ema. With the blue/ black falling wedge still in play that resistance will be 146.6 tomorrow and from there we can test the overall black bear channel dating back to august which has resistance of 153.4 tomorrow. 

Support- 144.9 -> 141.2 -> 138.5

Tesla is the wild child that no one wants to touch cause its so unpredictable. The biggest thing that happened today is that it failed to make a new daily low for the first time since October 31st. Many (me included) have been waiting for the bounce on telsa that just never came. We just might be looking at that bounce right now. With 190.9 clearly being resistance on Tesla we very well may be looking at our double top rejection. This daily hammer candle very well could result in a double top and further sell off tomorrow. 

Biggest thing to watch for tomorrow is whether Tesla closes below 188.3 or not which is the weekly 200ema. 

Support- 186.7 -> 177.4

Resistance- 194.3 -> 197 -> 201.8

Pretty impressive candle on the daily chart here for the VIX. The biggest drop as I said since May 4th. While the VIX was in much different levels back then something that is VERY intriguing to me is that today we dropped to about 22.84 and recoiled and the VIX closed right at that key 23.5 support level. I am a little surprised to see that on a 5.5% green day for SPY. Actually I am surprised that the VIX didn’t drop more like 15% especially when you consider that on big red days for CPI or other events we can see a 12-20% green day on the VIX. 

This 23.5 level is a big level. The VIX could be hinting to us that the markets are not as bullish as this rally today wants us to believe. I will be watching for a double bottom pop on the VIX tomorrow. 

**Where am I at right now? Bearish or bullish ?**

To be honest we couldn’t have had a worse outcome today. A beat on CPI just leads to even more speculation from the markets that the Fed is going to pivot/ slow rate hikes next meeting. However, the thing is that MoM inflation did not come down and while yes these were “beats” under expectation and under previous its hard to say after one good reading that we beat inflation. With SPY now being over the 75% retracement line of the bear channel the risk to reward to run calls up here is very low. However, this rally could last too long and we may never see an actual drop to pay out on puts now. I don’t forsee until next CPI/ FOMC any thing big enough to actually put the markets in sell off mode. While I do think we pullback a little just to naturally fill some of this wildness I don’t think itll be too sustained. But playing calls up here just seems like playing with fire too. We are definitely in a short term play area right now.

However, lets keep this in mind… 

CPI YoY- 7.7% puts us at the lowest reading since February which was 7.5%.  
 CPI MoM- 0.4% was under forecast but was the same as previous… that means inflation is still increasing… don’t get this confused… we did not DECREASE inflation… it just didn’t go up as much…  
 CORE YoY- 6.3% is a decrease but only puts us back at September CORE of 6.3%. that means we saw core go up for one month and then come back down to the previous months numbers.   
 CORE MoM- 0.3% means after two back to back months of 0.6% MoM CORE we did finally decrease….   
 

Now here is something that I already have on my radar and will be doing a lot of data diving into to figure out the best play for next CPI/ FOMC which is back to back (thinking we can really nail a banger). 

Lets chat really quickly to put it on our radars about the August drop in CPI and the august rally (mind you this is the ONLY other “beat” on cpi all year). 

In August CPI YoY beat at 8.5% coming down 0.2% form forecast and an impressive 0.6% from previous. The interesting thing about this prediction was that the forecast was so far below the previous with the 0.2% variance it woulda been incredible if we missed. Interestingly enough the following reading for September came in 0.2% over forecast of 8.1% but WAS a beat and decrease. Looking at the numbers for CPI YoY we have now had 5 readings in a row of CPI YoY decreasing… 

CPI MoM in august was forecasted at 0.2% and came in at 0%. This is the closest we have been to a decrease in inflation all year but we have still NOT gotten an actual negative reading for MoM. After the August 0% reading we had 0.1% -> 0.4% and now we have 0.4% again. So despite a BEAT of forecast CPI MoM has actually not seen a decrease to match CPI YoY. 

Since August CORE YoY of 5.9% which actually wasn’t even a beat from previous it was unchanged we had a 6.3% and now a 6.6% reading on YoY core. This reading was 0.2% beat from forecast and a 0.3% beat from previous. From the April CORE 6.5% reading until August we did see a decrease/ unchanged on core YoY. I will be closely watching to see if CORE YoY can unwind again or if we are going to go up. 

Core MoM was 0.3% in august which was a pretty impressive beat from the previous 0.7%. Much like CPI Mom we have not had a negative reading yet and we have not by any means tamed inflation but there has been slowing of CORE MoM unlike CPI MoM.

I am seeing a pretty big potential where we COULD get another good reading on inflation in December actually. Again everything comes down to the forecast. As long as the forecast comes in 0.2% below current actual readings so that would be forecast of CPI 7.5, CPI MoM 0.2, CORE 6.1 and CORE MoM 0.1% we actually could see another impressive beat and our first back to back green CPI days of the year. 

Now do I believe in real world that inflation is tamed? Absolutely not… no way… shit is so expensive its not funny and yeah used cars have come down (sucks more then It helps) new cars have not come down to match that used car drop. The biggest thing to watch for CPI on December 13th is 1. Will CPI YoY give its 5th consecutive drop, 2. Will CPI MoM and CORE MoM give their first negative readings (showing an actual decrease not just being unchanged) and 3. Will CORE cpi start the trend of coming down again.

The crazy bull case would be that we get back to back good readings on CPI come December 13th and then on December 14th while we still most likely get a 50bps this COULD give JPOW the fuel he needs to finally say the magical words to the market of “we are ready to slow hikes at the next meeting and see the full effect of our rate hikes.” A hinting at 25bps would be an pretty bullish thing and we could end up seeing December 13th and 14th turn into some impressively green two day rally based on that news. I will keep you guys posted and of course post a full trade plan and analysis/ breakdown for those two days.

Daily log- 

Today for me was an amazing day and for many in the server who played the strangle or amazingly played calls only the payout was phenomenal. After the morning win I did open one lotto put pretty early when things started to look heavy and that we wouldn’t take out 390 today, however, that quickly got wrecked. It was worth the risk to reward as I wouldn’t have in my wildest dreams expected a 5.5% green day on spy today. I am shocked we broke through 390 and that we kept pushing EOD even higher.

I played a few level to level plays on SPY but I couldn’t bring myself to scalp today. For me when we are at such an extreme and as much as I want to trust it to continue I struggle to believe in my plays which makes me struggle to believe in myself and I end up cutting early or cutting red when I shouldn’t have. Days like today are better left untraded for me. 

Tomorrow is going to be interesting to say the least. I wouldn’t put it past markets to not even look back and just straight push to gap fill 403 tomorrow but I more sensibly expect a 384 to 390 pullback.

Inflation is at about 10% right now, but most ETFs I look at seem to do even worse than that. I had the idea of spending about 50-100€ a month to buy into ETFs as a means to escape inflation. Usually they should be doing about +7% a year, but right now, they all seem to crash or at least do worse than inflation. 

The only way right now I feel like is worth investing is to invest in some shitcoin and get lucky. I thought about buying into apple stocks, since thats the only big company right now which doesnt completely do worse or at least not as bad as inflation. 

That being said: Is it even worth investing ?

Brent crude closed down 2.92 %. Spot gold settled down 0.43% at $1,705.17 an ounce. The dollar index remained higher against a basket of six major currencies, closing at 110.48.

SPY

SPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday’s low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday’s low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.

QQQ

QQQ held Tuesday’s low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.

DIA

DIA also held Tuesday’s low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA’s weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders’ attitude towards the market. 

XLF

The financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.

XLI

XLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium. 

Most popular tech stocks ended in the red. Apple fell 3.32% on news that the company's first AR glasses have encountered design problems, affecting the 2024 launch. Microsoft fell 1.91 percent as the company faces a new EU antitrust complaint about its cloud computing business; European Union antitrust regulators have launched a sweeping investigation into Microsoft's $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.

[Tesla](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-TSLA/) shares fell 7.17%, closing at their lowest level in about two years, after Musk sold at least 19.5 million shares worth $3.95 billion. Unlike the market, Tesla didn’t experience a large gap down at the open. Although it dropped 1.82% during the first 5 min, TSLA then rally back to $195.85, breaking Tuesday’s high but failed to fill the breakaway gap on Tuesday. On the daily chart, TSLA made a new low for the last two years and broke the pivot point $179.83, which was the low on 03/05/2021.

Here is my forecast based on historical CPI data and analysis. There is a chance based on Cleveland fed all miss besides CPI Yoy though. It will be a very spicy open. But something interesting to keep in mind is that this is the reddest pre-CPI day we have had since June. And for those of you who remember pretty much before July we used to get an almost standard and expected 2% intraday sell off on SPY the day before CPI… it appears we just started that trend again. Tomorrow will be interesting to watch. 

Will keep todays TA brief as we will have a massive move either way and the dust will settle and we can decide where we could be headed next.

We did break through that 378 key level support which has held up and we also broke through the rising wedge on the daily that we have been trading within since the last CPI. Based on my calculations bull case puts SPY somewhere between 385.3 to 389.1 tomorrow and bear case puts us near 362.9 to 359.2. 

Key daily supports around this range is 365 -> 360 

Key daily resistance around this range is 384 -> 388.6

Regardless of what reading is we are about to see the next big move and direction for markets. If CPI beats and JPOW truly can say next meeting that “inflation has slowed” and “we see reason finally to slow rate hikes” then we are going to see a push toward 400-420 by next CPI and FOMC (December 12/13th). However, if CPI misses (especially core and or MoM) then what JPOW said about not having inflation tamed and that it is pre-mature to even consider slowing hikes right now is about to be sang on every new outlet. If we miss I think we head down towards 320-340 before the next CPI/ FOMC in December.

Apple just closed below its last CPI candle body low of 134.9. Today tech as a whole (besides meta) looked probably the worst it has looked In a very long time. This further tells me that a CPI miss is not price in and that tech especially will get absolutely slaughtered. 

Looking at previous CPIs 5-6% movement is possible on Apple that gives us a possible 127.8 to 126.5 tomorrow which would be a new 52 week low for Apple… actually Apple right here is 4.4% from its 52 week low at close of market today. This is the first close below 138.4 support level since June of this year.

Zoomed out on tesla is beyond ugly and I feel like this thing is just going to get driven down until it closes under $100/ share. Currently 172.2 support is the 2022 bear channel on Tesla if that level breaks then there is just the massive weekly bear channel left as you can see. This also potentially will be the first close under the weekly 200ema since October 2019.

The VIX remains hella underwhelming putting in a mild 2.15% green day on the eve of CPI. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the VIX somewhere between 27 and 28.3 at open tomorrow and we could breach 30 if CPI misses that big. 

Daily log- 

Honestly I struggled today with the technical. A lot of oversold indicators then pushing $1-$2 through that level to then reverse then push further. I got stopped out a few times only for it to go green and I didn’t close green for it to reverse on me too. Overall ended green thanks to a few scalps but tough day for me. 

See what tomorrow brings with CPI.

Since the beginning of this year, as Federal Reserve continued to raise interest rates, a number of rich people have suffered varying degrees of decline in their wealth, including [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/).

Recently, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/)'s company, [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/berkshire-hathaway-holding-stocks/), reported third-quarter earnings with revenue of $76.934 billion, up 9% from $70.583 billion in the same period last year; net loss of $2.688 billion compared with a profit of $10.344 billion in the same period last year, but was sharply narrower than the $43.755 billion loss in the second quarter.

For the full year, revenue for the first three quarters of 2022 was $223.924 billion, up slightly from last year's $204.296 billion. But it lost $40.983 billion in the first three quarters of this year, compared with a profit of $50.149 billion in the same period last year, due to a poor investment environment.

Judging from [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/)'s performance this year, it's not so bad.

As early as the first quarter of this year, in fact, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) is still bucking the trend of growth. He changed his regular strategy for the past 5 years and increased the intensity of investment. In total, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) bought $51.8 billion of shares in the first quarter and sold $10.3 billion, according to his earnings report. His cash pile fell from $143.9 billion to $102.7 billion at the end of the quarter.

After the general direction was set in the first quarter, its position has been small changes, more persistent is to continue to buy western oil.

Specifically, Berkshire lost $13.465 billion on investments and derivatives contracts in the third quarter, bringing its losses to $82.362 billion in the first three quarters.

In terms of total holdings, Berkshire's market value is $306.167 billion so far, compared with $350,719 billion at the same time last year. That represents a decline of about $50 billion over the course of a year. The changes in the market value of these positions are not from losses caused by active adjustments, but losses caused by passive declines in the stocks they hold.

 

https://preview.redd.it/r0brm5g32wy91.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=75cfc448c824b2b23f0f168b8723813984e9d9b3

According to the earnings report, Berkshire's top five holdings were unchanged, as follows:

First, Apple, with a market capitalization of $126.5 billion. According to statistics, so far this year, Apple's stock price has fallen by 21.03%. From the perspective of position contribution, Apple's position has contributed more than half of the loss limit.

Second, Bank of America, with $31.2 billion in market value. Bank of America is down 15.37% for the year;

Third, Chevron, with a market capitalization of $24.4 billion. Although it rose 63.89% in the year, but the overall position is small, the impact on the entire position is not big;

Fourth, Coca-Cola, with an open position of $22.4 billion. This year's increase of 2.95%, it is reported that this has been the fourteen consecutive years of Coca-Cola increase;

Fifth, American Express, with an open position of $20.5 billion. It was down 7.06% for the year.

In terms of overall holdings, Berkshire's major investment losses are from Apple stock, so over time, for [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/), he will focus more on operating profit. Berkshire reported operating income of $7.761 billion in the third quarter, compared with $6.466 billion in the same period last year. Operating income for the first three quarters was $24.084 billion, compared with $20.17 billion in the same period last year. On that measure, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) still beats the market by a wide margin.

&#x200B;

In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 8.74% this year, while [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/berkshire-hathaway-holding-stocks/) A is down just 1.9%, so Berkshire is also beating the index.

The results also showed that Berkshire still had $109 billion in cash on its books at the end of the third quarter, a slight increase from $105.4 billion in the previous quarter.

Taken together, the big cash flow on Berkshire's books is still a reflection of the market's weakness, and while [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) has been buying Occidental oil all year, it's not enough to change [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/)'s overall position structure.

The last 4 daily candles are completely ugly with all these massive wicks and huge ranges and volatility. But we reconfirmed 378 as support on that huge sell off intraday and I am looking for 388 to 390 tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day before CPI there is a very likely scenario where we trade between 378 and 384 all day in anticipation of CPI. This would be much like October 31st if that happens. However, if we look at September CPI (highlighted by the blue circle) despite the difference in candle structure we are actually seeing a VERY similar set up. We had a bounce off a key support level (September was 390 and now is 370.5) and that was followed by 4 green days (for a total of 5.5%... we are currently at 2.1%). We could see a bigger push tomorrow to that 390 level which would get us about 5.4% rally over 4 days prior to CPI. 

If you remember September the market was pretty bullish back then too and was under the anticipation that CPI would beat pretty bigly. However, it missed huge and back then much like now the market was Not prepared for a huge miss on CPI. 

When I look at the VIX now and IV compared to the last few CPIs the vix is extremely low and IV rank/ IV is very low. For instance today IV was around 30-32 which last CPI was 40-50. The market is not hedged for a huge miss or a huge CPI dump… I stand by if we get a big miss (read my cpi trade plan posted under pre-market analysis) that we might get our biggest red open and we might see a repeat of September also.

I didn’t talk about it under SPY but futures much like spy did break that FOMC resistance line today. We are holding that 3805 as support nicely, however, hard rejected at 3865. I am looking for futes to retest 3865 tomorrow and push for next major resistance at 3925. A rejection at 3925 and SPY 390 would actually form a really nice daily double top prior to a bad CPI reading and could be the “top” for a while.

And then there was tesla… once again another massively red sell off on tesla, however, this time it had a nice intraday recovery. Tesla is now down $37.05 in 3 days and $50.65 total over the last 6 days. That is a pretty insane sell off on Tesla.

Looking at the weekly ( I don’t usually talk about the weekly chart intraweek but this one is important to show). On that morning sell off Tesla hit its weekly 200ema. This is the first time Tesla has touched the weekly 200ema since October 2019. Even during the covid crash tesla never touched its 200ema on the weekly. It did touch and bounce aggressively off its 100ema though. 

If Tesla is going to bounce… this is the best chance it has. In addition unless Tesla opens under 182.4 -3.7% it will break its red dotted aggressive 3 day sell off resistance line and I believe attempt to go for its 197 gap fill tomorrow.

The VIX is at a very interesting crossroads here… it is holding now in a consolidation pattern 24.4 to 25.8 and remains in its downward bear channel. 

The June CPI which from these levels resulted in a 3 day spike of the VIX for 32.1% was at 23.8 the day before CPI. The June 10th CPI resulted in a -1.66% open and closed down -2.9%.

The July CPI was at 25.79 two days before CPI and resulted in a smaller 11.3% spike over 3 today. The July CPI opened down -1.52% but closed only down -0.52%. 

The September CPI was at 22.64 two days before CPI and resulted in a 3 day spike of 19.6%. The September CPI opened down -2.2% (the reddest CPI open) and closed down -4.35%. 

We COULD expect a 21% spike on the VIX starting today through Thursday EOD. This means Thursday the VIX should hit 29.3. But realistically could end up somewhere between 26.9 and 31.9 on Thursday. We also COULD be looking for about a -1.79% red open (or somewhere between -1.5% to -2.2% Thursday morning) if CPI misses. 

The thing to keep in mind at least for me is that this market much like September is not in any shape or form position for a big miss. I also do not think if we do miss we see a repeat of October or July because back then we were at the 52week low and people were HEAVILY hedged with puts. But now that people are not positioned that way it will be much harder for us to rally intraday especially with the VIX so low.

I don’t study the P/C ratio as I feel its never helped and is just a data point but currently the P/C is 2.34% and the IV is 41.3% which is relatively low IV wise compared to the last CPI where were near 50. The call volume actually greatly outweighs the put volume (maybe someone can explain this better then me) but the actual put OI is much higher then the Call OI.

Today was a pretty good day… not going to lie not being greedy saved me about 4 different times from getting wrecked… I luckily opened that tesla call at a lotto size and was able to average down and get out with a smaller loss but still not great. 

Interestingly enough data wise for me today I went 100% with SPX scalps (weeks win rate is 90.9%), and my level to level plays intraday on spy were also 100% win rate (with the weekly win rate being 85.7% for just spy level to levels). However, I am 0 for 2 this week on tesla L2L plays and last week I hit 71.5% win rate… for the last two weeks for just Tesla L2Ls I am averaging 55.5% win rate…. For the last two weeks my P/L $ on Tesla L2Ls alone is -$389 and last week with my 71.5% win rate I had a P/L$ of $1279.

I had that 60% loss yesterday on Tesla (shoulda been cut at -30%) that if it was not for that I would be profitable on my L2Ls. But I like to anlayze my trades to see if what im doing is working or not. I will be keeping a close eye on this the rest of week and next week to see if there is a case to stop my Tesla L2Ls and stick to strictly SPY.

Despite the struggle almost all day for SPY to break through 370 resistance we finally saw spy break through before power hour and end the day extremely bullish. The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. 

However, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday. 

Support- 378 -> 376.2 -> 374.7 -> 371.4

Resistance- 380 -> 384 -> 388.6

Futures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It’s a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. 

If 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s. 

Key support- 3805 -> 3750 -> 3675

Key resistance- 3865 -> 3925

Apple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill. 

Key support- 138.1 -> 137.1 -> 135

Key resistance- 142.1 -> 145

And then there was Tesla…. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. 

Highlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom. 

Key support- 197 -> 193.3 -> 184.3

Key resistance- 201.8 -> 205.6

The VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn’t hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days… the VIX has either closed red OR closed <1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart.

Looking at the fear and greed index… we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot… from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. 

The current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  

Januarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  
 Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  
 Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  
   
 

That would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days… that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th…. 

Now hear me out on this one which is even more WILD… December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)…. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible… 

Something to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week. 

Daily log- 

Today was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn’t miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it… though I wouldn’t have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all. 

&#x200B;

Something important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. 

The best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week… every trade is a new chance… If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. 

Something I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play. I don’t want to get in a habit of that with these level to levels even though I know sometimes they need time to mature… this COULD result in a lower win rate as I may stop out more BUT for instance today had I stopped out on my Tesla and SPY level to levels that closed very red I would have ended up very green today. 

Actually had a capped my L2L plays at -25% today for the two losers I would have only closed down -$50 for my L2L plays and with my $1249 from scalps today woulda ended the day up $1199 instead im ending it down about $103.

* Berkshire’s operating earnings totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.
* The conglomerate spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion.
* The Omaha-based company suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the third quarter’s market turmoil, however.

Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a solid gain in operating profits during the third quarter despite rising recession fears, while Warren Buffett kept buying back his stock at a modest pace.

The Omaha-based conglomerate’s operating earnings — which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities — totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.

Insurance-investment income came in at $1.408 billion, up from $1.161 billion a year earlier. Earnings from the company’s utilities and energy businesses came in at $1.585 billion, up from $1.496 billion year over year. Insurance underwriting suffered a loss of 962 million, however, while railroad earnings dipped to $1.442 billion from $1.538 billion in 2021.

Berkshire spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion. The pace of buyback was in line with the $1 billion purchased in the second quarter. Repurchases were well below CFRA’s expectation as its analyst estimated it would be similar to the $3.2 billion total in the first quarter.

However, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire’s equity investments amid the market’s rollercoaster ride.

Berkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is “usually meaningless.”

Shares of Buffett’s conglomerate have been outperforming the broader market this year, with Class A shares dipping about 4% versus the S&P 500′s 20% decline. The stock dipped 0.6% in the third quarter.

Senseonics on the other hand just got approved a few months ago. It already landed an approval for the second largest insurance provider in the US.

Not only does senseonics CGM has a 180 days implantable device. It completely obliterates dexcom and Abbotts 14 days. Not to mention they are already thinking even further and are developing the 365 day CGM. 


I sens a buyout coming soon, and it will very likely be from Apple. Apple has been working relentlessly on trying to figure out ways to monitor blood glucose through their apple watches. Not only will this give access to the apple watches to do this but it will put apple inside your body as an implantable device.

You maybe short sides but the potential is huge here. Now add to all of this the news I mentioned above of it being integrated with Apple health. Not to mention senseonics is one of the heavily shorted stocks that happens to be a real growth company. Well you do the math but than again you are on wallstbets so I don't expect you to know math.

48,48,48.0,Apple warns Covid restrictions in China are hurting iPhone production,"*China needs to seriously chill*

Apple said in a statement on Sunday that it has temporarily reduced iPhone 14 production because of Covid-19 restrictions at its primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly plant in Zhengzhou, China.

The factory, operated by Foxconn, is operating at “significantly reduced capacity,” Apple said. It warned that it would ship fewer units and that customers would experience longer wait times when ordering devices.

Apple’s warning brings up the possibility that it may sell fewer iPhones in the December quarter because it is having trouble making enough to meet demand. It previously signaled slowing growth in the December quarter last month.

It said that it continues to see strong demand for the affected models, which are higher-priced than other iPhone models and start at $999 and $1099.

In the past week, China has ordered lockdowns in Zhengzhou, where Apple does the majority of its iPhone production. The factory in China has grappled with employees fleeing the facility because of its Covid policies and outbreaks, according to Reuters.

China continues to pursue a “zero-Covid” policy that requires facilities like the iPhone facility in Zhengzhou to operate as “closed loops,” where workers isolate in dorms and work in factories separated from the outside world.

It currently takes 31 days to receive an iPhone 14 Pro if ordered from Apple’s website, longer than the average 2-day lead time for less-expensive iPhone models, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a note on Sunday.

52,52,52.0,"Trading ""Level to Level"" with Options","**How to Trade Level to Level**

This is a question I must get at least 10 times a day. So I am going to indepth do my best to explain to you guys what a Level to Level or L2L play is for me. 

The whole reason I started including more of these is that despite this being a scalpers market I realize its nearly impossible for someone to mirror a scalp. While it can be done the reward generally will never be as great as mine for the mirror. These plays are more of a set it and forget it sort of play and a play that due to the longer DTE and longer time held everyone can play them while still having a great risk to reward play. 

**Picking a DTE**

First off this is NOT a scalp this is a play that will usually take a while to develop and very well could develop overnight too. With that in mind that immediately means we need a slightly longer DTE to utilize. For SPY I prefer a 3-5dte, however, this also greatly varies on the actual way premiums and theta are hitting. When I play a Tesla or Apple L2L I prefer at least 3dte or longer. Since general stocks only expire on Fridays that means pretty much after Tuesday I will refer to the next weeks DTE. The issue especially with a stock like Tesla is that it moves like Wildfire so if you are wrong or the play does move against you then you will need to your way you will get wrecked before its ever worth it. 

You have to weigh a short enough DTE that the move nets you profits quickly but not so short that if the play takes time to develop as it usually does that you don’t end up missing out hugely. 

**Choosing the correct position size** 

This is the one tricky thing about the L2L plays. We have to chose a size big enough that the risk to reward is there and that we get a nice pay out. However, we can not immediately open such a large position size that we end up with a big loss if it goes against us. 

The way I enter my position sizes is of a normal scalp size (which is about $2000-$2500 for me). I like to open at least 50-75% immediately depending on how strongly I feel about the play. If I feel its going to be a pretty aggressive move and that im timing pretty much right before the bounce then I will open closer to 75% if not more and end up near $2000 for the trade. However, if like Friday I expect it to consolidate first possibly then I will usually start with about $1000-$1500 initially opened. This allows me to average down if I feel the play is valid and it holds my stop loss. 

But wait! DD you say averaging down a loser is just making a loser a bigger loser!? Correct! I did say that… however, that applies mostly for a scalp. I NEVER add to my scalps because those are 0dte… And those are pretty much hit or miss. I either immediately hit profits and close or im pretty much immediately wrong too. So averaging that down is not smart. However, this play factors in an average down on purpose and also uses clear support/ resistance levels to average down. 

**When to stop loss out**

The thing about these level to level plays that I enjoy is that they have a built in stop. So let me post an example of that from Friday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyxlirrs5dy91.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c334066f4339df0ea6f1b3621210da0c8aed6c2a

So here you can see I already KNEW that my stop loss was going to be if a candle closes below 370.6. Now you gotta be forgiving with this too. So within reason because we did have a candle close near 370.5. So if we had closed under 370 I would have closed this play. The important thing I factor into this also is that I want my stop loss to be somewhere around 20% still. That’s just how my risk to reward and win rate works. I don’t want one L2L loss to wipe out numerous L2L wins. 

**When to average down?** 

Lets take a look at a Tesla L2L I took on Friday also and this will be a great example of a time where averaging down works. Friday when tesla on the daily had appeared to be holding 210 support and forming a nice double bottom I entered a 7dte ATM Call. My take profit target was near 215 to 219.3. Looking back at the daily and weekly charts I know that Tesla for the last 2 weeks has broken through 205.6 support numerous times but everytime it has popped back up and refused to close below it. So what I did was purposefully make my stop loss closing UNDER 205.6 EOD. This gave me enough room where at the LOD I still only saw about -30% 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke1qvu9t5dy91.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2afd0346939b4b734eba1c269086788d3729de0

Okay above you can see my call out on the play. Now lets look at how it actually played out intraday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ud60poqt5dy91.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d77f12eb18e0ec03fda6482dfa1f8baa974a58

So with this Tesla L2L you REALLY had to trust the levels. You had to trust that even though we broke key support that we were going to see a recovery by EOD which has historically happened time and time again. This was a great Risk to reward play as this is probably one of the strongest levels tesla has. 

Now looking back I could have absolutely waited for 205.6 support test before initially entering the play, but on Friday you can see we had that massive sell off after a strong morning and we had bounced off that key 210 support are intraday and was appearing to recover. The one thing looking back that I DID misplay on this was not waiting for the candle to break back over the 5ema before entering this play. However, leaving room to average down and knowing the key levels we can be a little aggressive and sometimes snag a more reward in doing so if we recognize the risk. 

So here once EOD we broke back over that 205.6 level and closed back over the 5ema I was able to average down on my call. I did end up hitting exactly break even at one point EOD before the choppiness hit. With this support level being so strong I felt comfortable swinging this over the weekend. Knowing that we could retest 205.6 but most likely would bounce but after that EOD recovery I expect to see a bigger push up at open Monday to look for an exit. 

**How I choose the play**

The way I choose my level to level plays is based off daily price action along with current intraday price action. What I am looking for is when we find a key support area on the daily chart that the intraday 15min chart is then finding support at. 

Lets take a look at another example from Friday 11/4/22 on SPY. 

&#x200B;

Taking a look at Friday here is a L2L play that I made on Friday. So you can see I clearly have highlighted in purpose 370.6 as a key support. This is one of my levels established from my TA on the SPY daily chart. What I saw here is that after the massive morning sell off we bounced hard off 370.6 and continued to hold all candles closing over this level. We had about 10 candles bounce off this level total. When I saw this extremely strong support establishing around this level I knew it was time to enter a LEVEL TO LEVEL play. 

The first thing and most important thing is we have to chose a DTE. For me I chose a 5DTE. Why did I choose a 5DTE? When we first bounced and double bottomed off the 370.6 level at noon I Did expect a big bounce back up near that 374.9 resistance, however, I knew it could consolidate there first (which is exactly what ended up happening). Had I taken a 0dte play here by time EOD that move up finally happened I would have been. 

Now that I chose the correct DTE we have to set our TP target and our Stop loss target. 

Take profit will for a call play be the next resistance which in this case is 374.9. 

Stop loss target as I mentioned was a FULL candle closed below 370.6. As breaking that key support would signal a bigger downside to come on SPY. On the daily 370.6 is actually a huge level support that separates periods of price action. 

Once we enter the play do we diamond hand it or do we take profits when we can? Well this is where things get tricky. In the end PROFITS are KING.

Here is what it looks like for me at least on a few different L2L plays from earlier Friday morning. As you can see for these I actually entered a 3dte and 5dte on SPY (I actually usually do this to show you guys the difference in pay out not so much because I wanna play it both ways) but for tesla I did enter the 0dte because in the morning that’s how strongly I felt about the play and knew it would hit quick but would let the 7dte tesla play out longer.

Usually I look for at least 10% but if I recognize that things have turned against me then I will exit for a much smaller gain. There is no reason to let a play go red… 3% green is better then -20% red. 

Generally I will just add some stop limit orders as you can see and I will continue to increase that level as price moves in my direction. And if it stops me out green well it’s a win either way! Now the issue here is that many many times I stop out way before the actual L2L ever fully plays out. Which means I miss out on a HUGE win, however, if you look at the first stop limits here I was playing the 374.9 support to 378 breakout and got a nice win. I really thought we were going to see a huge green day and very well could have let those run think we see 380-385. However, had I done that on Friday I would have taken a massive loss on that sell off. 

I would say the biggest risk on these L2L plays is that we can not use a hard fast and set stop loss. If we do at say -20% like we usually do then we may stop out before key support actually holds and the play develops. However, when the key support or resistance against us breaks we have to exit and be okay accepting the loss.

Here is an example of when I actually followed my own stop loss and had I actually diamond handed it this play the very next candle would have been back to profits. However, we HAVE to be mechanical in trading. We cant be smarter then the candles or the charts. IF the play fails it fails. If it comes back to life after we close it… then that’s something we can consider and something to take into play about perhaps using a looser stop loss next time but in my opinion for every play that came back from the dead there are 10 that never came back. My losers that I have held that never come back GREATLY outweigh those that come back to life.

U.S. and Europe have been fairly relaxed with COVID since the vaccine has released. But China has not. Any inkling of covid, and they lock down hard. So much so that workers are not allowed to leave work, quarantine there, and then only leave to go home when the government allows it. 

As a result the largest factory in China has had many workers quit and they plan to not go back. If this continues for more than a month this could lead to a 30% reduction in iPhone sales, which would spell a loss for Apple next quarter.

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -> 363.6 -> 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -> 408.6

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures.

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -> 3705 -> 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -> 4085

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&#x200B;

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -> 133.3 -> 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -> 147.1 -> 150.8

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support.

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -> 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -> 245

&#x200B;

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope.

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

60,60,60.0,"Apple is now valued more than Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined"," 

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

[META is projected to grow  to record rev in 2023 to 2025 still and just needs to cut spending. ](https://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796)

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

&#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.

UPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though.

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -> 365 -> 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -> 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right?

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow. 

Key support- 214.9 -> 210 -> 205.6

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

I try to have the same mindset that I had during this last bull run what will be the future now where can I risk my money on a future gamble, and this seems like it can be the future, Meta has tons of more cash to throw at this and the engineers.

Powell agreed there wil at some point be a time to slow rate… however, he confirmed that time is not now and it would be pre-mature… The question that will remain now is was this some unbelievably wild over reaction to what JPOW said or did we just witness the top get put in?

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -> 370.5 -> 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -> 379.9 -> 384.1 -> 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -> 3675 -> 3585

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -> 141.1 -> 138.2

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port.

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits.

&#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter
(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.

Seems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion

&#x200B;

They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT

&#x200B;

Is it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?

&#x200B;

How is the company still GROWING?

74,74,74.0,"11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA","It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities… I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip… that day was today. 

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish.

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -> 377.8 -> 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -> 390.1 -> 393 -> 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish. 

Key support- 3845 -> 3800

Key resistance- 3885 -> 3925 -> 3975

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema. 

Key support- 148 -> 146

Key resistance- 153.4 -> 155.7 -> 157.4

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it. 

Key support- 230 -> 224.8 -> 219.2

Key resistance- 234.2 -> 239.6

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months.

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons.

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback.

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -> 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -> 155.8 -> 157.4

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -> 219.3

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness.

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

The FCF has been ERASED! The only big tech that has decided to smash its cash flow generation capacity. Zuck doesn't care. He is all in into the METAVERSE. F\* you shareholders. Investment returns? You should have bought APPLE.

100 F\*ing Billion per year! Hey Regards, he could be buying your entire GME company 12 times each of these 2 years. 

But... was this a SHHURPRISE? Mmm... no! This is what he already anounced last year, and the stock did a rally from 320$ to the 340$ after releasing this:

&#x200B;

The capital he will allocate in CAPEX will be 33-34 Bn$ each year, in 2022 and 2023. This is basically data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. As he says, ""increase in AI capacity""

So...

how is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.

The share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. 

OCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?

# Scalping Review

SPY opened at that 380 range and held (important level to hold as noted in last post). It started its first leg. It came back down to 380.96 at around 8:12 UTC-6 and tested 20 MA and AVWAP. It bounced and continued upward, completing another leg and half or so. For the next hour and half, SPY traded in a large flat top triangle - getting three bounces off the 385.04 line on the scalping chart. SPY broke out of the triangle at 10:15 UTC-6 and backtested twice. The 388.96 full measured move was hit EOD. SPY continued it’s uptrend and traded in a rectangle from 11:10 UTC-6 to 12:32 UTC-6. It broke out and hit 388.96 full measured move EOD. We closed right around 389.34 line on scalping chart.

I found some time to trade in the AM before I went golfing. I took four trades. I played the second leg of the uptrend.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks ended a volatile week with a sizable gain as Apple's earnings report boosted technology shares and a smattering of economic data suggested the Federal Reserve is making some progress in its battle against inflation.

  
The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 both posted their longest weekly gains since August. Gains in major technology companies such as Microsoft and Google Parent Alphabet aided both indexes in reversing a two-day decline.

  
Treasuries fell on Friday, snapping a three-day rally, as hopes of a Fed pivot faded. The dollar rose for the second day in a row.

  
This week, stocks, bonds, and the dollar swung wildly as investors tried to make sense of conflicting earnings reports and economic data.

  
Quarterly reports from megacap tech names underscored the impact of the Fed’s tightening regime, and consequently the surging dollar.

  
Meanwhile, a core measure of US inflation increased in September, strengthening the Fed's case for another jumbo rate hike next week. However, a contraction in manufacturing and services, as well as lower-than-expected US home sales, indicated that the Fed's actions were already having an impact on the economy. The release of gross domestic product data on Thursday temporarily allayed fears of a recession.

  
Economists continue to expect the Fed to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point next week, for the fourth time in a row. Rates are expected to rise another half point in December, followed by quarter point increases in the next two meetings.

90,90,90.0,"10-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Weekly Analysis and Recap (and how i went from 2 red months to 2 green months in a row)","Is anyone else having major déjà vu or is it just me? Lets flash back to last Friday… The beginning of of the week had a nice green two days followed by a doji Wednesday and a hammer candle on Thursday. This hammer candle showed downside potential and after hours did too. Then Friday came and out of no where ripped a 2.45% green day… Flash forward to this week its nearly an identical movement. I mean 100% identical. Scary at best. 

Today I am not too proud to admit I misplayed 100% and I unknowingly was far to bearish and bet against the markets. The worst part is… I even called this weekly rally last week in my weekly TA.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3a56ccw7mw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f85daeb5ea4b1cf9f4dac4f908e24f3738ffc38

Guess I should trust myself a little more huh? I definitely got blinded by the big tech earning misses, GDP coming in hot af, PCE/ PMI, job claims, etc etc etc. all of that was bearish af for the week. But what happened? Market didn’t care… why? Because the markets still believe JPOW is going to say on Wednesday at 230pm for FOMC (stay tuned this weekend I will release the FOMC trading plan to the server) that “we have inflation under control or we don’t wanna over shoot on rate hikes so we will look to slow down our hikes in December.”

This is why we are rallying in my opinion. 

So where does this leave us next week… well this is the scenarios I forsee. 

Monday and Tuesday I have pinned for a bullish because we really don’t have anything on the books negative wise. I don’t forsee anything economic or macro wise to really bring us down and its pretty clear by this weeks movements and recovery that bulls are in control and the markets is not going to sell off (I misplayed that today). 

Wednesday is FOMC day… I expect a green day. Now the question will be does JPOW rightfully say “we have not controlled inflation and while we do not want to overshoot rate hikes we need to slow inflation first” if he says this then we should look for a dump into CPI. However, if he says “I believe inflation is tamed and we will see the effects of that on the next CPI and going forward and that should allow us to slow our rate hikes… slow not pause…” we are going to rally. 

From there I honestly don’t forsee CPI coming in as a beat at all.. it actually is going to probably be a huge miss… if you remember back in August when CPI came in hot they held off on releasing the consensus (just like now) until we got very close to CPI… I have a feeling after or the day of FOMC we will see the consensus finally released. Which will allow me to accurately predict next CPI…   
 

Regardless of whether we rally or dump after FOMC I expect us to get a bad CPI reading and I will be looking for a repeat of August. What I think is happening is a tactful unwinding of the VIX prior to FOMC and CPI to avoid the crash once again. It seems like this is the general strategy that has happened time and time again. We get these rallies through bad news, and every dip is a buying opportunity where the technical make zero sense (such as this morning where VOLD was extreme bearish and nearly extreme bearish however we saw markets continue to rip). 

In short im bullish till Wednesday then we will take it from there… 

&#x200B;

In short SPY has maintained this red bull channel for 2 weeks now and until I see this bull channel broken I will remain bullish. I am seeing today we made a really nice double bottom off 379.8 which also was a daily 8ema support test and hold (this is the big play I over looked today with my bearish bias). In addition we put in a 2 day (almost 3) bullish engulfing daily candle. With maintaining and holding within this green channel and failing to retrace through it I am seeing that a 390.1 resistance test will be coming on Monday. The question is do we level up and push for the 400s before FOMC or do we reject that 390 level Monday and actually spend some time consolidating before FOMC. 

Fun note- this week is now the only the 2nd time this year that markets have put in a green week the week before FOMC the other time was July. 

If and when we break through 390 then I will be looking as the 50% retracement line of the bear channel and start eyeing 405.1 as next level resistance. I am not quite convinced that we will have the steam to get there but I do think we could take 395-400 before FOMC or on FOMC day (if jpow is bullish). 

However, if Monday we reject 390.1 channel resistance I would look for this red bull channel support to be tested and see if that 380 support holds. The one thing to note is that this is the first time a candle has closed over 388.6 since September 22nd.

Funny enough about this weekly candle is that this candle last night was showing a 100% different story. However, todays candle is our 2nd green week in a row and our first back to back green weeks since August. With this candle I look for continuation, however, we did fall just short of breaking through the weekly 20ema. We will need to take that level out then we can start looking at that next major level resistance of 408.9. 

If we double top of the weekly 20ema we could see a retracement back to that 375.6 weekly level. 

Key support- 385.2 -> 375.6 -> 363.7

Key resistance- 390 -> 399.8 -> 409.9

Futures put in a massive green day today and dead ended right at that 3925 level which just so happens to be its daily 100ema. On the bullish side of things you can see we held the daily 8ema as support today, reconfirmed 3800 as support and broke through the bear channel from August. There is no longer (besides the 2022 bear channel resistance) downward resistance to watch for. 

&#x200B;

Futures actually was able to close over the weekly 20ema. However, as you can see it fell just short of breaking through the orange channel level resistance of 3925. Next week we will look for futures to turn 3925 into support which should open up an opportunity for futes to test next level resistance around 4085. 

Key support- 3870 -> 3770 -> 3705

Key resistance- 3925 -> 4005 -> 4085

Apple put in one hell of an impressive day today making a total intraday movement of $9.68 which was 179% of its 10day average range. It also put in 175% of its 30day average volume today. People poured into Apple today. I think people found their “safe haven.”

Apple actually broke through its bull channels resistance and topped out right at 157.5 resistance today. With that being where apple hit and retraced we will look for that as key resistance to break over next week. 

This is the first time Apple has closed over the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema since September 12th. 

&#x200B;

Apple weekly played perfectly off the levels… for those who say TA don’t work or that you cant TA stuff when its parabolic… today even on a ridiculously big move Apple still respected levels. These chart levels were untouched and it closed right under that key 157.5 weekly level. 

With apple bounced off that red support line, holding 147.2 as support and closing over all the EMAs we should naturally look for some upside next week. 

Key support- 150.6 -> 147.3 -> 141.2

Key resistance- 155.8 -> 161.2

My love and hate relationship with Tesla is unmatched by anything else. Tesla provided me with 3 huge wins 3 days in a row, however, today I became too bearish and burnt myself playing some level to level plays. Now that I am being more objective I actually see a pretty bullish case for tesla next week. 

We came back down and tested the daily 8ema and managed to close back over that. However, we did fall just short of 230 resistance and the daily 20ema resistance. Tesla looked like it had no sense of direction today and that could have possibly been related to the twitter deal being completed today. 

With this hanging man candle on the daily I am looking for a repeat of 10/24/22 and will look to see a bigger push up on Tesla Monday/ next week. We are right at key resistance for the blue bear channel which lies at 228 for Monday. 

There is a case to be made as I mentioned earlier this week that tesla is establishing a consolidation channel from 205 to 230 and honestly until we close over 230 we haven’t officially broken that trend yet. 

&#x200B;

Tesla still has a daily and weekly gap at 262.47 to fill. I don’t forsee that filling next week but with a bullish enough sentiment and bullish enough FOMC its not out of the realm of possibilities. Bulls are not trading back over the weekly 50% bear channel retracement mark and will look to turn 2330 turn into support next week. 

Support -204.5 -> 191.7

Resistance- 245 -> 254.7

&#x200B;

As I had mentioned I do believe we are seeing the VIX being unwound before FOMC and next CPI. Its generally bad juju to have it over 30 before such events happen. With us clearly trading under the key 28.4 and now under 27 I will look for a the VIX to be near 23.6 to 24.7 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

10% challenge- 

Overall despite finishing green today (bless up tesla) today was not a great day for me. I was too biased bearish and I couldn’t get a read on the technical today. VOLD (difference of buy/ sell on NYSE) is one of my biggest indicators and biggest check boxes for entering a trade. Today until about 1145am VOLD was not supporting any sort of rallying. IT actually was showing that a huge sell off should have occurred. This also put me overly bearish, however, the charge was led by SPY and tech today and by mid day NYSE jumped on board finally. From there I still took every rejection (consolidation) at key levels as a short opportunity and ended up missing out on some good bull plays. 

Cant win them all and no ones perfect but I look forward to a good weekend to reset my head and trade better next week. This has been a pretty tough 3 days to trade in my opinion. Monday and Tuesday were great though thankfully. 

My Apple put was toasted at open but took a nice win on that Amazon earnings play at open to recoup most of the loss… apparently I shoulda gone even more OTM as one of the 80s puts on Amazon paid 1k%+ at open.

I was able to record my most profitable week in two months and my most profitable week of the year. Which actually is more impressive being that im trading with ½ the position size still that I traded with from January to May.

I have gotten a lot of questions of “how did you go from 6 out of 8 weeks being red to 8 green weeks in a row? “How is it even possible to go from losing that much to winning like this now?” 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time… risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”

I say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover. 

I will make this into a dedicated reddit post and mention a few other things later too but wanted to bring this up here too!

91,91,91.0,What the boomer idiot investors don't realize about METAverse,"I see some real shit opinions all over Reddit on META, as this place has somehow become a cynical cesspool of anti-intellectual teenagers that think they know better. 

Listen to me instead. An elder millennial that gets triggered by misinformation all day long and also thinks I know better. (sometimes it's even true) Also, may or may not be regarded. You tell me. 

Here's what I see:

\>""it looks worse than roblox / vr chat"" 

\>""Facebook is dying""

\>""bring back myspace""

First of all, shut the fuck up. Just stop. Please. It hurts my head. If it was true, that would be fine. But like I said I my autism gets triggered by dumbness. 

WHY has Facebook/META thrown nearly 100 billion at this? (with a revenue of 27 billion per quarter, they have the money)

Facebook is the ONLY multi-modal social media company in the USA. It has a marketplace, local community groups, videos (50% of all facebook traffic is watching videos) not to mention Insta, whatsapp. You can do almost anything on it. Run a business. Chat with your mom. See what your friends are doing. Rent a boat. Harass women with pics of your extremely small penis. Whatever you want! (don't do the last one bro. Just don't.)

So WHY? 

It's a hardware platform, that you cannot access on a normal PC. Only on a META VR headset (potentially) 

You think the graphics look bad? That's like blaming youtube for 480p video. Don't blame youtube. Blame the creator for having a shitty camera. Metaverse is the platform. Not the video. It's a new platform that has tools to do whatever you want. AR or VR both in one.

Now just imagine this, if you can. Tell your wife to hop off her boyfriend's dick, pull both of them over, and try to imagine with me. 

Your favorite youtube/twitch livestreamer? Don't watch them anymore. VR with them. Walk in their room as they talk to you. Sit at their desk. You're not behind a screen anymore. You're in the room. Even a prerecorded youtube video can work this way. Or do it live.

You want to see that Ye redemption concert tour but the tickets are $5,000? Attend in VR. Walk around, live. The performer doesn't need a headset. Just you. Interact with other VR people at the concert (or not). See their facial expressions. Dance with them. Switch your headset over to AR, go to the fridge, get a drink, check your texts, reply to an email, and then head back into the concert. All using the headset. Buy merch at the shop, which has an AR eshop overlay. Easy. This can be done with 3d camera arrays. Even a basic iphone can LIDAR scan a bedroom in 5 minutes. Apple ahead of the game as always. A highly accurate (to the 1/16"" accuracy) venue model can be recreated in a single day using current technology, like the Leica BLK360 scanner. That's your metaverse. It's whatever you want. 

You can't attend your best friends wedding? Attend in VR metaverse platform. The normal attendees will just see you on a screen (or not at all), they don't need headsets. But you can walk around, see the moment, while not being too invasive. To them, you're just on an ipad somewhere. Maybe there's a few 360 cameras around. Some LIDAR scanners to record the venue (or the venue provides this). You're not intrusive, but you can experience it. 

Want to buy a puppy on FB marketplace? See it in VR. Live. Confirm it's not a scam. Send the money through Facebook even, with buyer protection.

Onlyfans - see your favorite porn model from every angle. Walk around. Jack off in the privacy of your home. Squirt some e-jizz all over his/her face. or not. I'm not the boss of you.

The possibilities here are endless. This hasn't even mentioned the work from home benefits yet. This is still 5-10 years down the road. But it is coming. Reality and the digital world WILL mix together more and more over time. Unless the apocalypse gets us first ofc. And META has a huge head start in technology hardware and software tools (not software environment))

So. That's why you're all dumb for comparing it to VR chat. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

I sold my calls yesterday, but I plan on going back in next week on Jan 100c contracts.

* Apple stock surges, on pace for its best day since 2020
* Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.
* “Sometimes in-line results are most exciting,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.

If it holds until the close, it’ll be the best day for Apple shares since April 2020. Apple was the second-best-performing stock in the Dow Jones behind Intel on Friday.

The surge comes after a mixed week of Big Tech earnings, in which Meta and Alphabet

showed signs of weakness caused by macroeconomic conditions hurting the digital ad market. Alphabet rose less than 3% and Meta was up less than 1%.on Friday. Both took big hits earlier in the week.

Amazon fell 9% on Friday after giving weak guidance for the holiday quarter.

Although Apple signaled some slowing growth in the current quarter, and weakness in its profitable service business, analysts were generally positive about the company’s results.

 TA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200-day MA SPY, FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \~3490, sentiment,  inversion of the yield curve, upcoming recession, risk-free rate changing, etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally (and tells me this is just a bear market rally). Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on. 

Watchlist for downside: 

$AAPL, $CAT, $TR, $DE, $GS, $DJIA, $NFLX, $CMG, etc.

Will be rotating shorts around to lock in profits, reduce risk, etc.

Will also likely be increasing margin as my positions move in my favor.

132,132,149.0,"Top 30 ""Most Efficient"" Options Today","Hi guys, this is the second attempt at making this report after incorporating the feedback from some very regarded traders. 

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early. 

Zomedica is up-listed on NYSE American and compliance is ONLY $.20.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

165,165,188.0,Apple Q4 Earnings Preview: All Eyes On iPhone 14 Sales and Guidance,"[Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) will release Q4 earnings Thursday after the market. After several disappointing earnings posted by its FAAMG fellows (Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta), a weaker-than-expected quarterly result or guidance will further trigger stocks selling-off mode. 

Still, Apple’s current market cap is around $2.4 trillion, with PE 24.65. The stock is down 15.54% YTD, beating S&P 500’s -20%. 

**Here's what Wall Street expects:** 

revenue:  $88.68 billion, 6.4% Y/Y

diluted EPS: $1.26, up 2% Y/Y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/skr9qr5ddcw91.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=cff8e267d0a4159cd3db652d54791eba14f20868

Investors should mainly focus on the performance of U.S. and Chinese consumers, who contributed 45% and 18% company’s revenue in Q3. The iPhone 14 in other regions such as Europe and Japan saw price increases of 5%-20% compared to last generation due to unfavorable exchange rates and higher costs, however, prices for those two areas remained the same, probably for higher sales. 

**iPhone global market share increased further and the Pro series help driving ASP to a record high**

Wall Street expects iPhone Q4 revenue to be 42.66 billion, up 10% year-over-year, thanks to strong demand for iPhone 14 series. 

Research firm Canalys reported that global smartphone Q3 sales fell 9% year-on-year, recording third consecutive decline this year. However, Apple was the only vendor in the top five to record positive growth, improving its market share to 18% thanks to relatively resilient demand for iPhones, which includes latest iPhone 14 models.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/22viwg3edcw91.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=61d9418e2fad3def87e9abad9636cd4b5f255ef5

It is noted that iPhone 14 went on sale on September 16, a week earlier than 13 series, allowing Apple recorded roughly one-week sales into Q4 results. The initial demand will also set the tone for the December quarter covers the busy holiday shopping period, which typically achieves the highest revenue during the year. 

Consumers are more willing to buy costlier “Pro” models this time, due to huge improvement compared with 13 Pro Max (equip the latest A16 chip, the first ever 48 MP camera and dynamic island, etc). iPhone 14, the base model, got slight improvements from iPhone 13, but roughly the same price, which failed to capture consumers’ interests. 

Due to 14 Pro’s higher shipment proportion and prices, Counterpoint Research estimated that iPhone’s ASP (“Average Selling Prices”) will rise to a record $892 in the September quarter and $944 in the December quarter, higher than current record $873, achieved in the fourth quarter of last year.

But that also means iPhone's revenue will be mainly supported by two Pro models. And it also raises a question: can big demands for iPhone 14 Pro be sustainable throughout the next year?

Currently, if someone orders an iPhone 14 Pro 512G online in Los Angles, it will take at least 3-4 weeks, a week shorter compared with same period last month. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c4rkn3wedcw91.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=082ad301131bd1f3cf1c79b3b075572c8d3b215d

Apple hasn’t offered official guidance since 2020, and it may offer this time as well. Investors will be closely watching what Apple says about December quarter, the shopping season during the year. Any forecast or guidance that suggests lighter-than-expected results will be a risk to shares.  

**Will new** [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) **Watch and AirPods Pro help earnings this time?**

Wall Street expects Wearable devices, home and other products Q3 revenue of $ 8.79 billion, flat year-on-year. Accompanying with iPhone 14, Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE were both available on September 16, while Apple Watch Ultra and AirPods Pro II were available on September 23, which will be part of Q4 results as well. In addition, as iPhone 14 sells well, the accessories (cases, chargers) may also see some growth. However, analysts seem less bullish.

“We believe Wearables are the most discretionary product in Apple’s portfolio and therefore most prone to the pullback we are seeing in consumer electronics spending,” Morgan Stanley’s Woodring said in a note.

**Mac may be the shining star even PC demand slows sharply**

Wall Street expects Mac revenue for Q4 to reach $9.25 billion, flat Y/Y; iPad revenue will be $7.81 billion, down 5% Y/Y. 

It is noted that Mac revenue for Q3 fell 10% Y/Y and CEO Tim Cook attributed the drop to supply constraints, which means Apple couldn’t make enough computers to meet demand. Now, the supply constraints may not be a serious problem anymore, but demand is.

Declines continued for the traditional PC market as global shipments totaled 74.3 million units, down 15% Y/Y, during the third quarter of 2022, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Cooling demand and uneven supply have contributed to a year-over-year contraction of 15.0%.

""Consumer demand has remained muted though promotional activity from the likes of Apple and other players has helped soften the fall and reduce channel inventory by a couple weeks across the board,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers. ""Supply has also reacted to the new lows by reducing orders with Apple being the only exception as their third quarter supply increased to make up for lost orders stemming from the lockdowns in China during the second quarter.""

**Services revenue may slow further;** [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) **hiked music, TV+ fee first time ever**

In Q3, Apple's services revenue rose 12% year-over-year to $19.6 billion, the slowest growth rate since 2015, and is expected to slow further this time. Wall Street expects revenue to be $19.96 billion, up 10% year-over-year.

In July, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri warned investors that while services business would continue to expand, its growth rate would slow from 12% during the June quarter, citing the strong dollar and economic factors.

On Monday, Apple raised the prices of its Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple One in the United States, for the first time ever. Apple said the increase in Apple Music (Individual from $9.99 to $10.99 per month) subscription price was due to increased licensing costs. The company said artists and songwriters will earn more per stream as a result of the pricing tier changes. Regarding Apple TV+ (Individual from $14.95 to $16.95 per month), the company said the increased price reflects the growing catalog of original TV shows and movies. The price hiking may help services grow somehow (though not for Q4).

Overall, market still expects strong earnings from Apple under macro uncertainties. However, after Tesla, Microsoft, Google and Meta's disappointing earnings, if [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) fails investors as well, the stock market will surely suffer a further sell-off.",yeqoeg,31.0,17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yeqoeg/apple_q4_earnings_preview_all_eyes_on_iphone_14/,1666873677.0,2022-10-27 08:27:57,0.0

169,169,192.0,Foxconn's iPhone factory in China — the world's largest — hit by Covid outbreak," 

[Foxconn](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/2317-TW/) said Tuesday that its factory in Zhengzhou, China — the world’s largest assembly plant for [Apple’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) iPhones — was hit with a small Covid outbreak.

A spokesperson for the Taiwanese firm, officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group, told CNBC that operation and production at its Zhengzhou facility is “relatively stable with health and safety measures for employees being maintained.”

“For the small number of employees affected by the pandemic, Foxconn, in compliance with local epidemic prevention policies, is providing the necessary guarantees for livelihoods, including material supplies, psychological comfort and responsive feedback,” the spokesperson added.

Foxconn said that the impact on the group is “controllable” and the operating outlook for this quarter remains unchanged.

Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Zhengzhou, in central China’s Henan province, has been battling a new wave of Covid this month. The city has locked down some districts as China pushes ahead with its zero-Covid policy, using testing and lockdowns to try and tackle the virus.

 

Earlier this month, Foxconn implemented virus prevention measures such as requiring employees to have a Covid test within 24 hours of them entering the Zhengzhou premises and urged them to get vaccinated.

Foxconn’s position highlights the balancing act required by manufacturing facilities to meet customer demand under Beijing’s strict Covid policy.

Apple still relies heavily on China for the majority of its iPhone production, but the Cupertino giant has looked to diversify its supply chain.

Last month, Apple said that it has begun assembling its flagship [iPhone 14 in India](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/apple-starts-manufacturing-the-iphone-14-in-india.html). It is the first time Apple is producing its latest model in India, close to the device’s launch, which happened in September.",yefleg,1.0,13.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yefleg/foxconns_iphone_factory_in_china_the_worlds/,1666836303.0,2022-10-26 22:05:03,0.0

175,175,198.0,FAANG + Microsoft are all still a genuinely attractive buy to me,"Long story short I’m finding these 6 stocks to be very attractive currently for the following reasons: 

1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.

2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don’t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they’re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.

3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. 

I feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. 

Re: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they’re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. 

Hence, I feel there’s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind. They might get killed over the next 1-2-3 whatever years but I find them to offer solid and reliable value.

Tldr : used phone retailer SellCell says that price of IPhone 14 resale has dropped by 50%, meaning people don't want to hold on to their phones and want to get rid of it at a lower price.

Corning, maker of Gorilla glass for iPhone and iPad says it expects 14% year-over-year decrease in smartphone sales volume and a 17% drop in orders for tablets and laptops. They make other smartphones too  but the bulk of their revenue comes from Apple, I think.

IPhone 14 and and iPhone 14 Max are selling comparatively worse than the Pro models. But since pro models account for less sales since they are 100 to 200$ more, overall sales are down. 

https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/18/iphone-14-plus-demand/amp/ 

https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-cuts-iphone-14-plus-production-less-than-two-weeks-after-debut 

Apple has asked at least assembler to “immediately halt [iPhone 14 Plus] production.” as they ""reassess""
Also 2  Apple suppliers in China that rely on the parts and assemble them into larger modules are also cutting their production 70% and 90% respectively 

According to Wayne MA's source, these  changes are due to demand. Also, he confirms that the Pro and Pro max sales are insignificant compared to the Non-pro devices. 

Another worry is on the wearable of Apple, who are considered the most discretionary as they are usually seen as gifts for others. With inflation this high, people are very likely to cut costs and impact yet another lucrative revenue stream for Apple.
