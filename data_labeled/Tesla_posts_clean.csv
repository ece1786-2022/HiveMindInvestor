5,5,5,5,"11-23-22 SPY/ ES futures, and Tesla Daily Market Analysis (FOMC minute analysis)","Lets look at some highlights from FOMC minutes:

FOMC minutes:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tuxj7sq3xr1a1.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=a37f01e3cb06af38b6bff41107165ef3552a7d59

Overall when I read these highlights from the minutes honestly they kind of shock me a little bit. The overall message and the way the markets received these minutes was far more bullish (dovish) than JPOW presented himself at the last FOMC. The way JPOW presented stuff with saying that there was no reason to slow and that I was extremely pre-mature is not quite the same vibes im getting from these minutes and perhaps that’s why we did see a decent rally off of FOMC minutes here today. 

The biggest things im noting is that the fed does not believe inflation is under control and they also do no believe that they have reached peak fed funds (they don’t even know where its going to go). 

This could be enough to send markets bullish and to test the bull market resistance next week though. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gydvsda5xr1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=677044b7ea1e8214bbee781a672215cb816c9dcb

While I do not believe in the bullish push and I do not believe that the markets should keep rallying this is where we have to take our bias and ignore it. I will be looking at calls and will remain bullish on SPY until I see the rising wedge break and see the daily 8ema support broken. Today reconfirmed we are bullish and not only that we closed over the daily 200ema for the first time since August. 

With earlier last week touching and holding the 390.1 support level I do look now for a touch of the purple bear channel resistance at 405.4.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2e4fy8r5xr1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1573d79045267f436d7216058814e487d79e6c8d

Looking at the weekly (remember markets closed tomorrow and Friday half day) we are seeing quite a nice setup here to touch the weekly 50ema at 403.6 Friday and possibly with a big enough push touch resistance at 408.7 (about 1.5% green day). I see forming here a double top at 408.7 where we close Friday at or near 408.7 followed by next week touching the bear market resistance at 409.8 that then results in this current peak being put in much like the last channel resistance peak at 432 in august. 

However, if we break through this bear market resistance (the dark green line) then things are going to get really really interesting. A break through that from a technical and algo stand point could be pretty explosive. And as I have mentioned through this whole bear market there needs to be a reason for bulls to want to sell. And for people to not want to buy in for the “rally.” At this point there is not much left until CPI and FOMC. 

But now we get to an interesting place with CPI and FOMC. Lets say CPI comes in bad and CPI yoy increases or just a generalized missed. Will markets even care? JPOW most likely does a 50bps anyways right? Or do we see an even bigger reaction then we would usually see as market panics about another 75bps… he did say he didn’t have a reason to slow remember? 

This market get harder and harder to trade every day especially the more the bullish “copium/ hopium” that is pumped into it.

Futures daily shows a lot of the same on SPY holding this nice rising wedge (which does remind me spy/ futes broke the diamond pattern so we should have expected and continue to expect a push up). 

Key resistance- 4040 -> 4060 -> 4090

Key support- 4010 -> 3955

Tesla is the stock that giveth and taketh. I am a little disappointed in myself for perfectly analyzing this move up and really even calling it to the day and not reaping the rewards of that play… I got blinded by FOMC minutes today for sure. I was so bearish cause of FOMC minutes and historically FOMC minutes opens red so I did not want to take Calls on tesla. Then we had such a huge pop on spy at open I even saw the 176 breakout and thought we would hit 180 and didn’t play it. I also regrettably played puts expecting the 180 level to continue to reject as it had and well that did not go well… I also missed played it as it came back to me and I failed to close it for a small loss. I was eying a drop here on FOMC minutes and that never came.

Tesla broke through two of the three falling wedges today and closed over its daily 8ema for the first time since November 1st, putting in its biggest day since July also.

Tesla now looks something more like this. On the daily. 

If we are following data I analyzed below…

We should look for the top of this rally to be put in on Monday or Tuesday and finish us somewhere near 185.2 to 186.8. I will look for the next time we touch the daily 20ema for the next opportunity for some puts. 

Support- 183.2 -> 173.6

Resistance- 186.7 -> 191.5 -> 196

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jud7svt8xr1a1.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=df2e9d9e2c87df9d7c226e4b16c70410b5725878

Highlighted here on the VIX you can see that the last 3 “tops” were put in when the VIX broke below that thick red line at 19.7. This is where I am eyeing for the VIX to hit Friday or early next week. 

My ideal case to finally grab some 30-60dte puts is the VIX to break under 19.7 (doesn’t have to close but would like it to) and SPY touching 405.3 to 409.5 next week. If we break out over 409.5 then I will be more worried about going long on puts as we may actually get a bigger unwind on the VIX and we COULD see a bigger push for SPY to 420-430 before CPI/ FOMC.

This still remains a terrible time here as going long on puts feels early and against trend but going long on calls feels like fomo/ chasing/ buying the top.

To be honest just kinda of have felt off my game the last two weeks. I put in my 2nd red day of the week today. I actually cant remember the last time ive had two red days in one week. Been a few months for sure. 

Just haven’t been able to get a good read on the market lately. But I also evaluated myself today and I do feel I was today too bearish. Earlier in the week I was just getting caught by the choppy range and tight range with failure to follow through but today I was a bear and couldn’t get on the other side of the aisle. 

Some days we win some and some days we lose some. Some weeks we win some some weeks we win some… its impractical to expect anyone (im saying this to myself too) to be perfect. Its actually highly impractical to expect to have a green day or a green week every week. Considering I believe I have only had 4 red days now in the last 3 months isn’t too bad. But I hold myself to a higher standard. 

I for one look forward to the next day off and a half day on Friday before the weekend to reboot and get back in a good place. 

I am thankful for each and every one of you and I hope we continue to be thankful for the ability to do what we do each day.

6,6,6,6,BB quietly building towards the inevitable software defined vehicle future we got excited about in 2021. QNX is being adopted all around.,"BB 2021 surge is today distant past. For anybody who stayed long BB it has been 2 years of pain doom gloom and suffering. 

But the bottom is in. And the fundamentals today are stronger than they have ever been. 

While the market shat on BB post the IVY frenzy the Chenster and his posse have been busy. 

Cyber is going to stabilize in next 2 quarters (see Chen interview at ICE). We prob wont see explosive growth but we dont need that right now. 

What we need is QNX growth and that is what we are going to get that per the TD investor conference yesterday:

1) QNX is on fire. Design wins are progressing at fastest speed. First 6 months generated highest number of design wins as the prior 12 months. 

2) Record number of developer seats deployed. That means preproduction design revenues are growing as evidenced by backlog going from 490 to 560. 

3) QNX Revenues on track to hit 15 percent yoy growth. The 200-215 range is secured. 

4) Slowing economy does not affect pace of QNX design wins. Auto OEMs are transitioning to modern car architecture and they have no choice but to integrate QNX. 

5) BMW highlighted as key customer win. No car OEM wants to build their own core operating system software. Its too hard and not a differentiator. It all goes to BB. Tesla is outlier. But BB thinks they can help Elon FYI.

6) ASP per QNX deployment not something they will disclose. But per car there are larger number of use cases for QNX. So on per car basis the Revenue per car is increasing. Example a high tech BMW will utilize multiple QNX deployments. 

Want a bonus catalyst? Ivy on track. Expect first big announcement at CES in january. Check out CES speakers. BMW chairman is one of the key speakers and BB just signed a big QNX deal with them. Before year end you can also get some Ivy news via amazon. amazon is hosting REinvent November 28-Dec 3.

7,7,7,7,"Tesla Stock Rebounds As Bulls, Bears Say $500 Billion Slump Overdone","Tesla shares have shed more than $700 billion in market value since peaking in early November of last year, but analysts now suggest the carmaker is poised for a comeback.

Tesla  (**TSLA**) shares moved firmly higher Wednesday after analysts at Citigroup lifted their rating on the clean-energy carmaker while Morgan Stanley noted that the stock's $500 billion slump maybe coming to an end.

Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli lifted his rating on Tesla to 'neutral' from 'sell', while boosting his price target by around $35 to $176 per share, arguing the stock's year-to-date decline of around 58% has ""balanced out the near-term risk/reward"" for Tesla investors.

""To be sure, macro/competitive concerns are likely to remain an overhang with capacity rising, but as we’ve previously written, in a hard landing scenario Tesla’s long-term competitive position likely also improves and potentially further enhanced by (President Joe Biden's inflation reduction act),"" Michaeli wrote. 

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, meanwhile, said Tesla shares are ""approaching our $150 bear case, driven by price cuts in China, decelerating EV demand and other market currents."" 

Jonas, who carries an 'overweight' rating with a $330 price target on Tesla stock, said that while the ongoing distraction of CEO Elon Musk's foray into Twitter will likely expose investors to added risks, the group remains on pace to grow sales by around 37% next year, generate $15 billion in free-cash-flow and consolidate its position as the word's dominant EV player.

""We believe Tesla's 'gap-to-competition' can potentially widen, particularly as EV prices pivot from inflationary to deflationary,"" Jonas wrote. ""With respect to the (inflation reduction act) we believe Tesla is by far the best positioned OEM in terms of potential eligibility for consumer tax and production credits.""

9,9,9,9,Stocks are slightly higher as Wall Street awaits Fed minutes,"U.S. stocks rose slightly Wednesday morning, as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve meeting minutes for clues into the pace of future interest rate hikes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44 points, or 0.13%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.11%.

Shares of Nordstrom fell more than 8% in the premarket after the department store chain reaffirmed its forecast. However, Nordstrom beat profit and sales expectations in its latest results, according to consensus expectations on Refinitiv. Tesla rose 2.6% in early trading after Citi upgraded shares to neutral from sell.

Jobless claims data came in higher than expected at 240,000 for the week ending Nov. 19 where economist expected 225,000, signaling that the labor market may be weakening. At the same time, however, durable goods orders for October were stronger than anticipated, coming in at 1%, more than the 0.5% expected.

Investors are awaiting the latest Fed meeting minutes, due Wednesday afternoon, for insight into the central bank’s approach on monetary policy ahead of the December meeting.

Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008. Economists are forecasting a half percentage point increase in December, and smaller rate hikes next year.

Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday. The S&P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.

Investors shrugged off fears of further lockdowns in China after the country reported its first Covid deaths since May. Instead, traders focused on some strong earnings reports, and bet on the likelihood for an easing in monetary policy from the Fed going forward.

“Investor psychology remaining optimistic is driving the rally in this market,” Eugene Profit, CEO at Profit Investments, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”

“Going into the next Fed meeting, I think the Fed will probably moderate their language a little bit, and I think investors want to remain optimistic, and ignore a lot of headwinds in this market,” he added.

Markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will close early on Friday.

Looks like VOLD was behaving nicely today and overall the technical were pretty solid. Kinda sad I missed today but in the end family is always over money/ trading. 

Tomorrow we get FOMC minutes and while its not guaranteed a big mover or big day this one with the fed pivot narrative and deciding what rate hike for next meeting could bring some good movement.

Quite a lot going on today technical wise. We did confirm that daily 8ema as support once again and if you remember I had suspected with the doji candle and closure over that key 394.7 support that we would see a bounce today. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i03j7jnjel1a1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f0b420fbf1bd2fee7d7535d183b65d11c8e02c2

My 0dte calls paid out nicely and made it worth missing the whole day today. 

Now today we see that we did break through that diamond pattern on SPY daily. This should open us up to some more upside and we also closed over that key 398.5 resistance. The next major support is 401.2 followed by 405.4. With FOMC minutes tomorrow and a lot of fed speakers I really don’t expect much bullish movement and the minutes are going to reconfirm just how hawkish jpow is right now. The keys level we need to watch is 398.5 and 401.2 tomorrow. Those will be our gateways. Also if we do close over 401.2 then we would be closing over the daily 200ema and that really would be a bullish sign. 

At this point there isn’t a big reason to short SPY until we close back under the daily 8ema. But again as I have said going long (think 30-60dte) here also seems like FOMO and chasing. Best thing to do here is to pay the short term.

Futures also broke its diamond pattern but instead of showing you that again here I am going to show you this rising wedge that is on futures and SPYs daily chart. This is very key to watch and could lead us to a touch of the 2022 bear market resistance line (the thicker green line) and this could be the pattern to watch to show the next leg down. 

With a closure over 4000 now and breaking the 3955 to 4000 consolidation period we naturally will be looking for the upside here. Key resistance is the daily 200ema at 4028 followed by 4060 and 4090. Key support is now 4010 and 3955.

Tesla did make a new low today despite closing green. I posted some analyzed data on tesla with its drops and pops so lets update these now and see what they show…

I want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… 

Sept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   
 Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  
 Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  
 Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  
 Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   
 Nov 15th (current drop)= 7 day drop -17.2% followed by a ????  
 

Average # of days for the drop= 6.8 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  
 Average % for the drop= -17.8% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  
 Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  
 Average % for the pop= 11.81%  
 

so what does this tell us? 

With todays new low we are now at day 7 of dropping and -17.2%. We are right at the average length of the drops before we see some upside. 

This also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 166.19 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 185.82 by Tuesday that 29th. 

Looking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. 

So again all this show us is that Tesla is following the cycle. With FOMC minutes tomorrow though that could be a wild card but I overall expect some upside on tesla the rest of the week. 

Overall 168 to 170 has now built itself as a nice support area here and we could see a push back up tomorrow to test that blue falling wedge resistance at 170. So unless tesla opens red tomorrow and never sees green it will break that blue falling wedge resistance which should provide a push up to at least 175-180. 

However, if Tesla loses 168 tomorrow then I will be looking for 162.5 which is the red falling wedge support line.

The VIX is still on a mission to break back into the teens it appears. I am a little surprised to not see a slight move up on the VIX today with FOMC minutes tomorrow but perhaps that comes in the morning which does seem to be the trend lately. The VIX also gap filled the August 19th 21.27 gap now (well it hit a low of 21.28 today which is one penny from being gap filled). With the VIX touching 21.3 and dumping even further away form its daily 8ema I would be eyeing 19.7 next which is where the VIX hit in August before the “top” was put in and we started our next leg down. 

**Daily log-**

Being that I was gone all day and had a nice win on my SPY calls I decided not to even attempt to trade anything in the morning before I left.

Overall a green day today and this green day turned my week back to a green week which is always nice. Wish I woulda held onto those tesla calls a little longer in the morning but after yesterdays $3 drop in one second that put me deep red I wasn’t gonna take a chance.

Ryan Cohen is a genuinely good human being - and definitely not a liar. 

That is why he wont say that GME will be successful, he wont say it because he knows it would be a lie.

 Other CEOs with less scruples like Elon will say things like this:

# Elon Musk Said In 2015 Tesla Could Be Worth $700 Billion In 2025 — Was 5 Years Early

I am so grateful for Ryan Cohen, he is like a sexy little jungle Panda - and I know he will do the right thing and play everything safe ensuring that GME has some marginal gains after remaining relatively flat for a few years. Hey, the stock price may not appreciate at all. 

Ryan Cohen is honest and if he doesn't have anything positive to say its probably because there is nothing positive. I appreciate that he does not want to be a ""meme stock king""

Ryan is a straight shooter - a man who loves dogs and children books. With Ryan you see what you get. That's why I don't appreciate people putting words in his mouth and insinuating that he is tweeting cryptic messages - RY-DOG don't play that. 

My opinion is that a lot has changed in the last year and Ryan doesn't have any answers regarding the future of GME and that is why he remains silent.

As one person offering a perspective - I would wait for Ryan to actually say something viable and exciting before getting excited yourself.

20,20,20,20,Iger won't save the Disney dumpster fire.,"Take all this with the grains of salt at the bottom of the cardboard container from Wendy's fries I just served you but Disney's in deep shit regardless of who is at the top of the company.

1. The its P/E ratio is 53. 
Thats just slightly lower than Tesla. Love or hate Tesla, their upside potential feels a lot higher than a company that's been shitting out creatively bankrupt sequels and remakes for the last decade. Which brings me to #2...

2. The IP is tired. 
The Marvel cinematic universe was a brilliant innovation, but that trains running out of steam, Star Wars hasn't recovered since the sequel trilogy and we're running out of classic Disney movies to remake.

3. Streaming Services ain't what they used to be.
Take a look at the Netflix ticker or Disney's losses in the streaming sector and it should be obvious to everyone that streaming services require more than ho-hum original content to survive. 

Disney made the mistake of thinking that because people like Disney content, they'll pay for a DVD player that only plays Disney content. A large number of people will, but making and maintaining that line of DVD players isn't easy or free.

4. Political BS
Whether you think Disney's gone too woke or conservative parents are hypersensitive bigots, it doesn't matter. The fact is there is a segment of the population that doesn't trust Disney to provide safe content to their children... which is like the whole reason Disney exists.

5. Bob Iger is a genius. He's also one guy and largely responsible for issues 1-4.

I have a huge amount of respect for Bob Iger, I even read his book! He may not be the best CEO of the 21st century so far, but he certainly played one on TV. He looked and acted the role perfectly.

He also got out right at EXACTLY the right time. February of 2020. Just before Corona and just after Avengers End Game. I have no doubt that his perfectly timed exit might be causing some people to view his tenure with rose colored glasses and ignore the fact that most of the rot we've seen over the last 2 years during Chapeks tenure, almost certainly didn't start there.

As Elon Musk spends 44 Billion Dollars on buying Twitter so he can *""create the town square of the internet""* (shitpost), I am left wondering how spending that money helps get us to mars? - or helps propel Tesla(sucks to be a shareholder rn) and the EV market?

I often day dream of a Universe where our billionaires create and launch IPOs for Biotech Companies Like INGEN. Why cant we have a John Hammond instead of a Jeff Bezos?

A place where our Billionaires invest in making Sabretooth Tigers and Mammoths instead of trying to make VR a thing.  Fuck all these Non-Dinosaur-Making billionaires. They are ruining peoples hopes and dreams.

23,23,23,23,11-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,"That was probably one of the worst days to trade that I have seen in months. The volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched. I had extreme flash backs to June and July where SPY was so irrational it was untradeable. The pretty extreme low volume (we are 4 mil currently at this moment below the lowest volume day of the year) made for even harder trading today. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im8lk7kgpd1a1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=27eb2cdf258092943a5701d05f273649aec1cdf1

This is where things continue to perplex me and I continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say. Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. 

So we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. 

This next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. 

Wednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight).

Last week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. 

The bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. 

We closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. 

The issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. 

Bears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. 

Key support- 394.7 -> 390.1

Key resistance-398.5 -> 401.3

Futures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. 

&#x200B;

I removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n4dh1vnipd1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7488b50427a19e5bfa3253f3bf0b131cbce538fb

Out of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. 

Back to futures now.   
 key support- 3960 -> 3925 -> 3910  
 key resistance- 4000 -> 4028

Zooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy86mnojpd1a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5225f763631b55f413c3dd6bc3e2cb95122ac2fe

Now looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. 

Interestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. 

This is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? 

I want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… 

Sept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   
 Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  
 Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  
 Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  
 Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   
 Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  
 

Average # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  
 Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  
 Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  
 Average % for the pop= 11.81%  
 

so what does this tell us? 

Well being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. 

This also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. 

Looking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6ebxazkpd1a1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2a2eda88760c96bf81025455f1a886dc4b406f7

There was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… 

Lets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. 

That means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. 

To be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks.

Really tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. 

From there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. 

A red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. 

HOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… 

Anyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. 

People really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. 

Long story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!

28,28,28,28,Tesla UDD (Un-due diligence),"So Tesla is valued as if they were soon to be the only car producer left in the world (not just electric cars, just any car).. meanwhile in China they have no more then 20% share of the electric vehicles market, meaning competition is already fierce even in the electric sector.  


And of course other historical brands are not sitting and watching... they might be catching up with electric, but a care is not just the engine. BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Toyota... all have an history and experience in cars that Tesla can only dream of, and are rapidly catching up with electric.  


Tesla doesn't even have to most advanced self-driving technology, and it's likely that someone else will win the self-driving race. Possible a software-based company, which will sell to other manufacturer.  


Tesla's ridiculous valuation is just based on the cult Elon Musk, but the guy is obviously quickly losing it, and likely to fall soon as well, or at least lose the edge in marketing...  


If Musk's delirium won't crush Tesla, it will eventually fall to it's ""real"" value, which I'd estimate round 20 billion, maybe 30 if they grow fast and exceed expectations in the next couple of years (unlikely).

Collins did not quite seem convinced that CPI was going to continue to come down and that we have beat it yet. Interestingly enough despite the expectation of a 50bps at this next meeting she very clearly said that 75bps was possible. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v7gey7l08s0a1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4763026e0e59aabd12d6d8264ca3f47bf2e52f4

The percent chance of a 75bps did go up about 13% from earlier this week. But as you can see we are still heavily priced in for a 50bps… this next CPI/ FOMC back to back day is going to be wild. We are either going to end up with two extreme red days or two extreme green days. 

If CPI beats then we end up with even more chance of a 50bps and markets rally going into FOMC expecting that. If JPOW confirms let the face ripper commence. If he says no and says 75bps or says 50bps in January we will see a repeat of the last two FOMCs.

If CPI misses then we end up with 75bps getting fully priced in (which it isn’t right now) and JPOW most likely drops a 75bps and hints at more rates next month (just like he has been saying) and the market dumps even more. 

I will say this is easily one of the worst weeks of trading (from a technical standpoint) that I have seen in a very long time. This extremely low volume, choppy, tight ranged and unpredictable movements have been absolutely brutal to trade. I am hoping after two weeks of this that next week will be a little better.

I was going into today bullish. I had planned to play SPY calls over night (which I closed for a nice 38.1%) and I had also planned to play Tesla puts. I didn’t end up taking the tesla puts which at open would have been very red, however, that first 15 minute candle on Tesla was a straight dump. 

Now that we got through today and have the weekly candle closed. I would say I am cautiously bullish on SPY next week. 

I am seeing that we held that nice daily 8ema support test this morning on that massive breakdown. With that support holding and also that red support line holding we now find ourselves in yet again another rising wedge inside of a bull channel. 

This hanging man candle should lead to continuation next week and should result in a retest of the daily 200ema at 401.2.

I would say I am cautiously bullish for next week. If you look here you can see that we have had this trend of channel resistance test, short peak, resistance test, etc etc. We are currently in the channel resistance test trend right now. That would mean either next week we touch 411.3 or next week we touch 409.9. 

This weekly doji sandwhiched between the weekly 20ema and weekly 50ema is a tough call. I woulda liked to seen a close over 100ema to confirm a push to that 411.3 area but we closed at a true doji instead of a gravestone. Had we closed down closed to 390-393 that woulda set up a more bearish structured candle.  

Something interesting about this week is that this was the lowest range a weekly candle has moved (about $12) since the August peak which was about $10 of movement). Today really looked like the buyers were exhausted. 

Support- 390.1 -> 376.2

Resistance- 398.8 -> 408.5 -> 411.3

I had mentioned that daily bull flag I saw on the futures charts and that I did think we might still be in it and today confirms we could be in it. We did hold that 3953 support level well, however we couldn’t get through 4000. Next week bulls really need to take out 4000 or this is going to turn into a consolidation before a leg down pattern. 

Spy and Futures both remain stuck between the 100ema and 200ema. I wouldn’t advise going long on calls here regardless but I wouldn’t go long on puts (30-60dte) until we break and close under 100ema

Showing the same exact stuff here on Futures weekly. Dead smack between the 50ema and the 20ema on the weekly. 2022 bear channel resistance remains at 4136 for next week.

**I** called out yesterday that I really thought with the daily bear flag that we would see tesla hit 177.4 support test and that I wanted to play puts for it but I was too bullish on SPY to do so. Well that was the right call on both sides… not playing overnight puts but also that tesla would hit 177.4 support. 

We did see it put in a really nice hanging man candle here too much like SPY. However, in this case with this nice downward trend and bigger support line bounce this should be seen as a reversal candle. I am playing tesla calls over the weekend in anticipation for this recovery. 

As you can see much like in October after a leg down Tesla has found itself in a consolidation channel of 177.4 to 196.1. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6i59v7v38s0a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8feb5b755f1a20e7e04d4fbb783bfd4e49d7bfbb

Tesla just continues to inch closer and closer to that 2022 bear channel support line. It also did put in a new 52 week low today yet again. This also is the first time a weekly candle has closed below the weekly 200ema since October 2019. 

Looking at tesla trends it looks like 3-4 weeks of red followed by 2-3 of consolidation is the trend we have been seeing. Obviously Tesla with the twitter stuff and Elon is a wild fire that can result in anything happening… but today seemed like an over-reaction and I do expect that recovery next week. 

Support- 180.1 -> 167.9 -> 156

Resistance- 193 -> 207.1 -> 228.1

Realistically as much as I refuse to touch the VIX we closed back under 23.5 and we are now nearing the support from the August bottom and last weeks support. We also continue to attempt to break out and reject the daily 8ema. 

Until I see any sort of meaningful change on the VIX and we snap this dramatic downward trend we have been in I have really hard time being bearish on SPY.

Daily log- 

This week absolutely has been brutual. To be honest if you are not struggling in this market then I am impressed. Even some of the best traders I know are struggling and having red days. Remember guys we have everything to lose in day trading. There is nothing wrong with sizing down or even taking a few weeks off. The market is not going anywhere… itll always be here. But if you lose all your money trading the crappy market we have been having you wont have any left to trade in the bull market.

I actually didn’t even scalp today. I also did the least amount of scalps I have done in months. I just was not feeling this price action and the risk to reward. The last few days have had so many rogue candles and so many pushes against technical that my usually money maker setups just weren’t hitting anymore. 

Looking at my weekly recap I was able to bring up my SPY and Tesla win rates quite a bit from last week. I ended up increasing my win rate on SPY by about 5% and Tesla by 13%. Yet again Tesla despite the lower win rate has been more profitable for me two weeks in a row. 

A lot of people question why I trade Tesla and this is why. Risk to reward in addition to SPY its great. Now I have found that a -20% stop loss is necessary and I have enacted this on all of my level to level trades. But taking these high probability trades at key supports or resistance with a long enough DTE that the move gets you about 10% but if you are just slightly off on the timing a small move against you doesn’t kill the play has been working well.

I have noticed without even meaning to that over the last 2-3 weeks I have transitioned to mostly these L2L plays. Which honestly isn’t surprising. I actually always used to do plays like these before this bear market started, however, I found the necessity to switch to quick in and out plays. Over time through countless hours of back testing and trial and error I have now gotten my Scalps and my Level to Level plays where I am profitable consistently. 

Hope you guys have a great weekend. 

Remember next week is a short week!

But every time I checked into the market today it looked like an absolute brutal tight range. We spent the first 45 minutes stuck in a $1.56 range. And the first 2.25 hours stuck in the same $2.06 range. These tight ranges unfortunately are becoming the norm in this market.

Despite the extremely bloody open today we managed with the mid afternoon breakout to close the gap from pre market so now the only gap we have is 381.14 to 385.64 from CPI and another gap at 403.1 to 408.46 from September CPI. As much as gaps “always fill” there is no time frame in 2022 for gap fills. 

The biggest bull case from today that I am seeing is that we broke all the way down to key level support at 390 which is also the 100ema and put in very nice consolidation there this morning to re-establish it as support before we pushed back up. With this 390 support bounce I will be looking for a move back to retest the 200ema. After CPI with that massive move up in a short period of time this could be the cool off/ reset before we push higher. 

However, on a bearish case we could show that after testing the 200ema and rejecting this is the beginning of the sell off which puts in the “top” of this current bear market rally. Quite a few of these rallies during the 2022 bear market have ended at major EMAs and the 200ema after trading under it since end of August is definitely a major resistance level.

Taking a look at futures daily actually shows a more bullish set up to me. Im seeing that same 3910 support bounce and reconfirmation on futes at the 100ema. However, this daily candle actually shows a more bullish reversal with this long wicked dragonfly doji. 

I would have liked to seen this get back over 3963, however, 3950 is a previous key level and we may re-establish that level here with this daily futes candle closing. We didn’t quite close on 3950 but back at that key level. The daily 8ema on futes did hold nicely today.

Tesla continues to trade within a falling wedge withing a falling wedge withing a downward channel. 

With yesterdays daily 8ema rejection followed by todays making a lower low and failing to break yesterdays HOD I am looking for a push lower. The issue with this and the reason I didn’t short Tesla overnight is that im bullish on SPY (tomorrow) and that makes me bullish at least at open on Tesla. OF course we have seen time and time again tesla does what ever it wants but that generally is related to a news dump. 

Looking strictly at Tesla technical I see a case for a retest of support at 177.4 tomorrow. However, we could see this 183.2 support with a doji candle turn into support and push us up tomorrow. 

Key support- 183.2 -> 177.4

The VIX today held over that key 23.5 level however once again rejected the daily 8ema resistance. It does appear we did just barely poked our the wick through that blue support line today. 

With that support break through and the back to back gravestone dojis I do forsee the VIX to retest 23.5 support tomorrow and possibly break through it. However, we have a lot of options expiring tomorrow.

I was gone with my son on his field trip all day today so I wasn’t able to trade much today. However, I took a quick scalp EOD. 

I did decide to swing some 5dte SPY calls over night. With that major 390 support bounce today and the EOD push up with the VIX unwinding more I like the risk to reward of pushing up tomorrow to retest that key 395 to 398 range. 

I didn’t wanna play 1dte (0dte at open) overnight because we have had so much crazy volatility and really unpredictability pre market/ after hours and being opex like that I didn’t feel comfortable with a shorter dte.

This looks like a classic abandoned baby bear pattern. That would indicate there is more downside to go tomorrow. However, zoomed out I do see a potential bull flag forming here also. The last 4 days most of the trading was spend between 395 and 398.5. We really need to see a clean break under or over these levels to have a nice sense of direction. 

We failed outreach the daily 200ema again today but despite the heavy sell volume we managed to hold 395 support very well. I don’t particularly have an opinion on where we are going tomorrow and for that reason I did sit cash overnight.

Tesla had broken out of its falling wedge yesterday only to now find itself back inside yet again another falling wedge. With that nice daily 8ema rejection and double top off 196.1 yesterday I did take some overnight puts slightly OTM on Tesla and boy did they print at open! I unfortunately did close a little early but I like to take profits. Tesla especially has a way of moving like wild fire at open where you don’t know if its about to rip $4 green or $4 red. I have found with Tesla if I am correct its best to secure profits immediately at open and if im wrong its best to wait on the first 30 minutes.

Looking at Tesla daily today we now have yet again another falling wedge formed but more importantly than that we did break through that 5 day long blue support line. This should open up some more downside for Tesla here now. 187.66 is currently the weekly 200ema on tesla which we now are back under neath. I was watching this level very closely last week and as I had mentioned last week a closure under this should open up a lot more downside.

I don’t ever include a 15min chart on the VIX but I just had to show how flat it really was today. Between the bold vertical purple lines is the intraday open to close. The vix held an impressively tight $1.73 cent range all day long. Im not sure if people are still on edge about the Poland/ Russia stuff and are unwilling to take their put hedges off or if we have just reached a point where no one is putting downside protection on but the fear isn’t ready to continue to unwind out of the market. 

Overall though we are clearly still holding that 23.5 level where I struggle to be bullish shorter term/ longer term until we unwind under neath that.

This week has been pretty interesting for me. I haven’t really been doing it on purpose per say but I have found that I have take a major risk off on Scalps this week. I have only scalped a total of 9 times this whole week (about 3/ day). However, in the last month or so I have been averaging 5-10 scalps/ day. I also have seen a major uptick in my level to level plays now fronting about 8-10/ day when over the last month I have at best done 2-4 a day. 

Overall I would say win rate and profits have been consistent with this change. I still believe we are in a scalpers market but I have really been enjoying these level to level plays. While I find that humbly I am good at scalps and good at recognizing high probability set ups. IT has been a really nice change of pace to be able to open a play and let it play out without having to have my finger on sell the whole time and without being worried about one small pop stopping me out only for it to come back to my favor. 

Something to keep in mind in my level to level plays and really in any strategy you deploy in this market is the risk to reward. I am not perfect and it would be practical to have a 100% win rate all the time… yes at times I have done it for short periods of times but its improbable to expect it. What we need to focus on is high probability and high risk to reward set ups. So this means we have to be willing to go into a position that COULD stop us out at out -20%. But the risk to reward and probability of green is high enough that the reward out weighs the risk. It is also important in this market to use stop losses. 

Most importantly though it is important to be mechanical in those stop losses. The second you remove that stop loss “to let it play out” you already loss. You loss because you broke your rules in an attempt of being smarter than the market. 

Stay mechanical. Take the high probability plays. Don’t be afraid to take 3-5% if that means green. If you see it going against you… we don’t have to let it play all the way to the stop loss.

36,36,36,36,"11-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Going to shy away from further TA on Apple. For me personally I don’t focus on it much anymore and I just don’t want to waste my resources on it when I have had a much higher success rate with Tesla and of course my GOAT SPY. 

Today we saw yet again another massive sell off. I am trying to decide if markets are truly that over extended that anything will cause a dump or if we are just getting truly rogue new waves causing a dump. The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now… it sure shows signs it doesn’t want to stay there. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfq05cbxt70a1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bceb8d88dc64a122111ae099429909bfb085c4f

The one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland “incident” is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. 

Now SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is… did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.

Support- 398.5 (key pivot point) -> 395 -> 393 -> 390.1

Resistance- 401.9 -> 405.3

&#x200B;

Looking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. 

Futures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965. 

Support- 3965 -> 3925 -> 3900

Resistance- 4002 -> 4027 -> 4060

Tesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation. 

Support- 190.8 -> 185.7 -> 177.4

Resistance- 196.1 -> 201 -> 204.9

We did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn’t take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren’t that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC. 

There still is a very real scenario where JPOW says 50 bps hike and hints at another 50bps next meeting in January. On top of that there is nothing saying after 5 consecutive decreases on the CPI YoY readings that we don’t get a rogue spike in CPI YoY that sends the markets tumbling. At this point with the markets now expecting a beat on CPI any miss is going to get bloody… like historically bloody type of days…

Good day today. I was busy with my daughter and her birthday most of the morning so I wasn’t around to trade until about 1230… hit that morning put scalp on SPX before I left. I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don’t enjoy trading much and I also don’t trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play. So I was mostly cash. Still a green day but small at that…

I am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don’t know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn’t even a missile… we probably will never know the truth. 

I did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. 

That’s the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of “are you going to take profits at open?” “you going to take your loss at open?” and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn’t about to play out.

37,37,37,37,DOD Review 70 Candian Critical Minerals Companies for Investment," 

**The Canadian government provides a list of 70 projects**   
The United States military has quietly solicited applications for Canadian mining projects that want American public funding through a major national security initiative. It's part of an increasingly urgent priority of the U.S. government: lessening dependence on China for critical minerals that are vital in everything from civilian goods such as electronics, cars and batteries, to weapons.  
It illustrates how Canadian mining is becoming the nexus of a colossal geopolitical struggle. Ottawa just pushed [Chinese state-owned companies](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-critical-minerals-plan-1.6634386) out of the sector, and the U.S. is now considering moving public funding in.  
The American military has a new pot of money at its disposal to help private companies inaugurate new mining projects; it's for funding feasibility studies, plant renovations, battery-recycling and worker training.   
President Joe Biden invoked the 1950 [Defense Production Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2989973/defense-production-act-title-iii-presidential-determination-for-critical-materi/) to expand the domestic mining sector, and the military received [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/climate-bill-canada-minerals-1.6551920) to implement it. This whirlwind of activity was prompted by a [White House study](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf) last year warning that dependence on certain foreign-made products represents a national security risk to the U.S., and it cited semiconductors, batteries, medicines and 53 types of minerals including **graphite**. [Read More](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends/79e1ed40-64eb-11ed-b7c5-8e0d74f3ac48/preview)....   
**Why Graphite is Important**  


Despite boasting a large EV market, the US does not produce any natural graphite and must rely solely on imports to satisfy domestic demand. The level of foreign dependence has increased over the years, with the US importing 38,900 tonnes of graphite in 2016, followed by 70,700 tonnes in 2018. According to the USGS, in 2020 the US imported 42,000 tonnes, of which 71% was high-purity flake graphite, 28% was amorphous, and 1% was lump and chip graphite. The top importers were China (33%), Mexico (23%), Canada (17%) and India (9%).  


But remember, the US is not 33% dependent on China for its battery-grade graphite, but 100%, since China controls all the spherical graphite processing. Such a level of dependence can be considered both unsustainable and uneconomical. It’s also important to consider the environmental ramifications of persisting with China as the go-to graphite source. Coal still dominates China’s energy mix, meaning the carbon footprint of all products, including synthetic graphite, is quite high.  


One study found that producing 1 kg of synthetic graphite releases 4.9 kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, whereas for natural graphite the CO2 emission is 1-2 kg. Synthetic graphite currently accounts for 58% of the anode material market share, but its environmental footprint means that the industry is expected to gradually shift towards natural graphite.   
Lomiko is developing a graphite mine in Quebec where recently, a company with a similar deposit has recently received funding from Panasonic and Mitsui, groups involved in battery-making operations for Tesla. [ Read More....](https://nmg.com/panasonic-offtake/)

**Canadian Government Announces the Fast-tracking of Mineral Projects**  
Canada will have to fast-track energy and mining projects if it is to help its democratic allies and achieve its own net-zero ambitions, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a speech this week in Washington — the most tangible signal to date that the federal Liberal government is prepared to address regulatory hurdles that have hampered economic development in this country for years.

**Lomiko's Discovers** **Motherlode** **of Graphite**  
Lomiko Metals Inc. (TSX.V: LMR) (“Lomiko Metals” or the “Company”) announcedcompletion of drilling and analytical results from the infill and extension exploration drill program at its wholly-owned La Loutre Graphite property, located approximately 180 kilometres northwest of Montréal in the Laurentian region of Québec.  
Belinda Labatte, CEO and Director stated: “I am happy to see that the results from the last eleven holes drilled on EV zone in 2022 are in line with the results we announced in previous press releases. These results show significant mineralization over large intervals, including LL-22-044 with 7.60% Cg over 119.8m from 81.2 to 201m, consistent with previous results. The wide intervals encountered in 8 of the 11 holes further validate the continuity and the quality of the mineralization in the EV zone. We look forward to receiving the results from the 26 holes completed over the Battery Zone in August and September.”  
**Highlights**  
Intersecting high-grade graphite values and significant widths  
8 out of 9 (11 holes total) intersected significant mineralization with two holes abandoned and redrilled due to challenging environmental conditions  
**Up to 7.60% Cg over 119.8m from 81.2 to 201m in hole LL-22-044 including 10.06% Cg over 40.5m from 81.2m to 121.7m and 10.31% Cg over 19.5m from 166.7 to 186.2m**  
**Hole LL-22-045 encountered 5.83% Cg over 27m from 204.0 to 231.0m including 19.5 meters at 7.63% Cg from 211.5 to 231.0m at 7.63% Cg**  
**Hole LL-22-050 encountered 5.07% Cg over 123.0 m from 13.0 to 136.0m including 14.5% Cg over 22.5m from 14.5 to 37.0m**  
**Holes LL-22-044, LL-22-045, LL-22-046, LL-22-049, LL-22-051 and LL-22-052 all bottomed in mineralization**  
Graphite intervals in 8 of 9 holes remain open; additional assay results pending  
The La Loutre graphite project site is located within the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg (KZA) First Nations territory. The drilling was supervised by Québec-based, independent geological consultant Breakaway Exploration Management Inc. and was operated under ECOLOGO requirements and compliance protocols, as Lomiko is ECOLOGO certified. Please see the press release issued on March 22, 2022 for more details about Lomiko’s ECOLOGO certification.  
The drill program at La Loutre was initiated on May 15, 2022, with the goal to further define the deposit, provide the data needed to increase confidence in the mineral resource and build on the results of the positive Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for the La Loutre project as announced in the Company’s July 29, 2021, press release. Lomiko has retained InnovExplo Inc, a Quebec-based independent consulting firm specializing in geology, resource estimation, mining engineering and sustainable development, to prepare an updated NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the La Loutre project following the completion of the 2022 drill program. The assay results reported in this press release are for eleven holes drilled at the central section of the EV Zone. These holes were drilled to confirm results of the previous drilling and provide better detail of the EV Zone in this part of the deposit. Please refer to Table 1 for the weighted average graphitic carbon-bearing drill intersections (not true thickness) and Table 2 and Figure 1 for the collar locations referred to in this press release.  
Significant intervals of graphite mineralization were intersected in 8 of the 11 holes. The best intersection was 7.60 percent graphitic carbon (“% Cg”) over 119.8 metres (“m”) from 81.2 to 201m in hole LL-22-044 including 10.06% Cg over 40.5m from 81.2m to 121.7m. Graphite intervals intersections in holes LL-22-45, -046, -047 and -050 remain open with additional assay results pending. Holes LL-22-044, -045, -046, -049, -051, -052 all bottomed in mineralization. Four other holes were planned for this area but could not be drilled due to difficult terrain or ground being too swampy, or soft conditions that prevented access.

“I was certainly surprised that Tesla did as well as it did,” Munger said in an interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick that aired on “Squawk Box” on Tuesday. Tesla has made some real contributions to this civilization. Elon Musk has done some good things that others couldn’t do.”

“We haven’t had a successful new auto company in a long, long time. What Tesla has done in the car business is a minor miracle,” Munger added.

Tesla became one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization over $600 billion. The car marker delivered 343,000 vehicles in the last quarter.

Shares of Tesla are down 45% this year after a near 50% rally in 2021 and a whooping 743% advance in 2020.

SPY went on a super impressive breakout back to 400 only to get absolutely smacked down. This was actually a super bearish close today and shows a local top in my opinion. It will take some big strength to push through 400 that is for sure. 

With this black bull channel we actually have a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow. Not sure exactly how low we will go but until we can break through and close over 400 there is not a reason to expect further upside. 

Key support- 393.1 -> 390.1 (key level support) 

Key resistance- 398.6 -> 402

Identical pattern on futures right now too… we actually came close enough on Futures to the daily 200ema to call that a daily 200ema rejection and again with these gravestone doji candles I expect this to be the local top and to see a back test of some stronger support levels like 390/ 3905 before we have a fighting chance of continuing up. 

Support- 3925 -> 3905 -> 3863

Resistance- 4028 -> 4060

Apple ran right into its daily 100ema today, however, found itself running into a brick wall and has now retraced pretty significantly. As I had mentioned last week this 100/200ema interaction on Apple is going to take some time and would be more then shock to shoot straight through. However, we could hard reject and retrace instead. 

Support- 146.9 -> 145 -> 141.3

Resistance- 149 -> 150.5 -> 153.5

Tesla attempted once again to break out over its daily ema and break out of this falling wedge on the daily however was once again unsuccessful. I had said last week that the 196.1 double top was in play and it sure was today. With this doji I do expect some downside tomorrow. IT did however find itself holding key support of 190.9 EOD. I will look for that support to break tomorrow and test the blue support line at 188. If we lose that support I am looking for 177.4 support retest this week. However, if we can hold support and finally take out the daily 8ema and 196.1 then we can look for the gap fill and possibly a bigger push towards 208.8 resistance. 

Support- 185.9 -> 177.4

Resistance- 196.1 -> 201.9 -> 204.9

Lots of movement on the VIX today. Had a nice 6% green open that led to a hard sell off under that key 23.5 range. However, still not exactly sure what caused it but EOD we had a pretty big spike of the VIX that put it back over 23.5 and caused it to close its biggest green day since October 6th.

Pretty sure I put in one of my best trading days in a VERY long time. I obviously I had that crazy 600%/$30k win last week but that was playing a CPI play… strictly day trading today was the best day I have put in in a very long time both with profits, win rate, and consistency. Felt great for sure and I know a lot of other did just a great today!

Still **Long** some John Deere : and it's up again this week to 406.03

Carvana, I could not get myself to trade it as a physical stock purchase, It went to many times south and I would have been stopped out. and while I did look at the options, I could not pull the trigger also . what it taught me is that I have a system, it works based on some characteristics, and I'll stick to knowing that i can sleep well. 

Traded tqqq for a fast $50, again I am not cut out for short term day trading, Not even week long trading. I need to look for stuff that has 8 weeks to 2 years of holding time. 

So this came across my desk this morning. Amazon ( when it was coming down from 98.5 to 97.5 ) and I am crunching numbers. Did my math and analysis. Went **long** ( when Amazon was at 100 ) with **October 2023 145 calls @ 4.26** ( yep that's my trade, horrible fill ), I do expect that by 12/26 I should have a solid grasp of the probable outcome. looking to exit around 19 when it's trading 144-ish by march 7th ( 3 x risk reward ), and if the uptrend holds shoot for 25 ( 5x risk reward) by may 18th around the 160 price. 

Now speaking about Tesla, I think this Insulin Eli Lilly fake account thing in twitter will have a correlation issue   [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/)  Will lead to a freaking huge lawsuit against Elon's groups and team. The One key part of that legal landscape is **Section 230**, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content ( right from google search ) clearly states immunity. Here is the problem, someone was able to buy the blue check mark, without the quality control of the past, it's not so clear cut anymore. That's my new line of research. maybe a good long term put but the cost seems so high do to volatility that there is no meat on the bone.

43,43,43,43,You’re all a bunch of sheep,"*Short term noise*

A stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. 

*”DD”*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

Thanks for listening to my TED talk, ik reading is hard. Oh and sorry my bad 😩🚀🚀📈

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

Position 33.69 shares (ik I’m poor).

Edit: I know this is WSB, but I just want to point out that there was only 1 comment that promoted conversation on topic. That’s extremely regarded, I’m impressed

Lets start with the FG index which I did talk about earlier this week on Monday we were only at 61 and we have now jumped up to 66. As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. 

I wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. 

January the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  
 April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   
 August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.

That means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at 401.6 and find out rejection point there. This actually is exactly where we rejected in august on the dead cat bounce. 

This COULD give us a trajectory of about 339.4 sometime between December 1st and December 20th. However, my one caveat here is the million dollar question “what would the catalyst for such a drop be?” Earnings is over, no cpi/ fomc until December 13th/ 14th and more or less there isn’t much I can for see that could panic people enough to sell that intensely. 

So if we break the trend and we let the FG index run hotter than usual the next question is “where are we going? How high are we going to go?”

Looking at the daily chart I see a bull and a bear case. Bull case would be that we push minimally to the 200ema at 401.6. If we can CLOSE a daily candle over that 200ema then I have no doubt next week we could test 405.4 channel resistance and we very well could end up testing that bigger solid green resistance line for the overall 2022 bear channel. This resistance on Friday is 410.8. 

However, if we either reject the 200ema or from here here double top and see downside the first stop is going to be 390. This is the level that bulls need to defend. If they lose 390 then we are looking at a pretty convincing minimally partial gap fill to 381.14. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rkrafse8iez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf2c3a225eaf8f4605823c4dae5e1717f1881da

Now if we flip over to the weekly view things become a little more clear. We dead stopped into the weekly 100ema today and couldn’t break through that. We have a nice blue bull channel formed here and a pretty mild black rising wedge also. 

Next weeks key resistance comes in at 399.5. This will be our pivot point. Break out over it and hold that as support through the week and we are looking at a test of the WEEKLY bear channel resistance at 412.7 next week. However, if we reject and form a double top here at the weekly 100ema we could be looking for that backtest of 390. Same with the daily if we lose 390 then we will look for a bigger retrace. 

I am pretty indifferent here in the fact that I don’t see a catalyst to make people want to sell at these levels. Most investors are probs thinking “bottoms in” and they don’t wanna miss the next bull run. It will take a lot to convince them to sell. However, Spy just put its greenest week in since the week of June 21st. There definitely could be at minimum some profit taking and with the VIX unwinding we could see some people start hedging for next CPI/ FOMC. 

For me I wouldn’t take a long here but I feel until we touch the 200ema its too early to start a put position.  

Key support- 390 -> 375.8

Key resistance- 399.5 -> 409

Similar case here on the Futures daily we haven’t quite touched that key 200ema yet which is the gateway for the next big run up or the potential for the next top.

When we look at futures weekly chart you can see this is actually a true weekly bullish engulfing candle. This should provide some upside for next week from a technical standpoint. However, we need to take out that weekly 100ema first. We are also well above that 3870 JPM collar call too. 

Support- 3915 -> 3770 -> 3705

Resistance- 4000 -> 4085 -> 4152 (bear market resistance… 3.8% from close)

Apple put that 135 support in this week and from here this thing has never looked back. I believe it will test that bear channel resistance next week. Apple fell just short of its 100ema and 200ema this week which as I have mentioned before on Apple is always a period of consolidation. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3v0exaraiez91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31939546e40711ce5d2787140850194ebbc40942

The weekly on Apple actually is still trading within an overall bear channel. That resistance comes in at 151.9 next week. If we see Apple break through that level then it has broken its bear channel and we can look for further upside. Apple did close back over its 8ema but fell just short of its 20/50ema. 

Key support- 147.2 -> 141.3 -> 138.2

Key resistance- 150.5 -> 151.9 -> 155.8

Tesla mostly due to its sporadic movement the last few weeks has quite a few things set up on it. It has the bigger red falling wedge formed on it that has a tighter falling wedge with that black resistance line within it. There is also a potential recovery support line highlighted in blue. 

Tesla did come up today and get near the daily 8ema but failed to close over it today it also came within 14 cents from the November 7th 196.66 gap fill. I am keeping an eye out for a double top Monday at the daily 8ema which also would coincide with the back resistance line at 196.8. As long as we hold under that resistance line there should be downside expected. However, once we break through that resistance then I would expect a test of possibly the daily 20ema (especially if the markets remain bullish). 

&#x200B;

I actually remain bearish on tesla, however, looking at the weekly it broke under the weekly 200ema as I had said for the first time in 3 years, however, it popped and closed over it. With this huge hanging man candle here there actually is a pretty solid case for upside next week. The weekly bear channel resistance will be 211.1 and will also be the weekly 8ema. 

Key support- 195.8 -> 177.8 -> 167.9

Key resistance- 207.3 -> 228.6

The VIX has now closed below 23.5 support for the first time since the days before the September CPI reading. This also is the lowest reading the VIX has closed at since August 26th which was Jackson Hole. 

This kinda goes even further to prove my point that I don’t see a bearish catalyst for this market. IF we look at the last two times the VIX was at these levels there was bearish catalysts that pushed it back up. Jackson hole and then CPI. But with no big fed events, no cpi and no FOMC for another month what is going to be the catalyst? What is going to be the reason the VIX wants to spike? 

There might not be one for the next month. If there is no catalyst we might be looking at the VIX going back to that support line from the August low at 19.7. For me this is where we open a longer 30-60dte put position. We are in no mans land right now. Going short is fighting the trend but going long on calls feels like we are buying the absolutely top. 

Remember guys… CASH is a position! We don’t always have to be long. We can be cash over night. We can play some short 7-14 dte plays and wait for the next top/ bottom to more clearly present itself.

I will do weekly updates on this but also include it in my daily log. The general idea here is I will be using $5,000 for ONE trade per day.. the goal is 10% profits BUT a hard set -20% stop loss. We will see where this takes us and if we can make one trade a day for about 10% profitable or not. On the right side you can see I broke it down in an equivalent had you used a smaller account instead of my $5,000.

Overall this was a pretty great week. My most profitable week ever I believe and I also secured my biggest win ever this week with that CPI play. However, I recognize while that was a high probability play… if I was wrong and we opened flat I woulda closed my week out red. 

I also made some mistakes this week. I let a few of my level to level puts run way too long and pass my 25% stop loss. Still a struggle but letting the SPY put from yesterday run to today for -82.32% and taking a bigger -60%+ loss on Tesla earlier in the week really hit me hard. 

This week I absolutely KILLED it on scalps hitting 95% win rate and a nice $4,889. I had mentioned last week and earlier this week whether or not tesla plays were worth it or not. In review you can see that my win rate was much lower on them, however, profitability wise I actually was very successful. Something some fail to remember is that win rate doesn’t always equal profits. For this week low win rate still netted profits. 

I am always learning and always critiquing my strategy. I will continue to monitor my L2Ls and see how next week shapes up.

Twitter is currently losing money, and is on the brink of bankruptcy. Elon will have to either sell it at a discount or invest MORE money into this company. Either way, it will be for a loss. 

As many of you know, almost none of Elon’s money is liquid assets. They are primarily in Tesla stock. The purchasing of this bankrupt company (which he is ruining even more) will cause him to sell a significant amount of Tesla stock. 

This won’t change the stock price a significant amount (you won’t lose much money), but enough to make other billionaires lose out on tens or HUNDREDS of millions of dollars. THEY WILL SELL. This will cause a chain reaction causing any average Tesla stock holders to lose a lot of money and panic sell, dropping the stock even lower.

A beat on CPI actually makes trading SPY for the next month even harder then a miss. Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI “came down” we have to deal with yet again the “fed pivot/ slowing” news media cycles hitting the tapes. 

Overall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode.

That is one hell of a swing and I cant even believe it myself. We also went from close in the bear channel to now closing in the purple channel completely skipping the green channel close. 

If the market is being rational it is going to come down and at least test 390 purple channel support. There could be a case for it to come all the way down to 384 or even 381.1 to gap fill. However, with the extreme volume on VOLD today and just the overall momentum I wouldn’t be surprised (despite it being illogical) to see tomorrow be yet another big green day. 

Support- 393 -> 390 -> 388 -> 384 -> 381.1

Resistance- 397.9 -> 402 (daily 200ema) 

Something I would like to point out is that this day is very similar to May 4th on SPY. That was a FOMC day that went on a similar insane rip EOD and end up with a flat top daily candle much like SPYS today. That day resulted in a massive drop the next day. Something interesting about this also is that the VIX put its biggest drop of the year in since May 4th today also. Tomorrow will be interesting to say the least.

Weekly chart wise you can see we are still in this bull channel withing the green 2022 bear channel. Resistance of this channel is 397.6 (this is a potential place we could pop to tomorrow before retracing). We also have a rising wedge inside this bull channel to keep an eye on too. Next week 2022 bear channel resistance comes in at 412.7. We break that and effectively bear market is “over.” Technical wise.

One of the single most impressive daily candles ive ever seen on Futures. It didn’t quite make it to 3975 resistance but we very well overnight may touch it.

Futures weekly setting up very similarly looking at the bull channel within the 2022 green bear channel with a rising wedge within that bull channel. 

4000 is the weekly 100ema and also the bull channel resistance for this week. 

4150 will be the weekly 2022 bear channel resistance for next week.

Apple with an impressive day closing up 8.9%. which is incredible. I don’t have the same data easily available on apple as I do spy but im sure since covid 2020 this is its and most of techs biggest closure. 

Apple broke through that red bear channel and actually closed over the daily 8, and 20ema falling just short of the daily 50ema. With the blue/ black falling wedge still in play that resistance will be 146.6 tomorrow and from there we can test the overall black bear channel dating back to august which has resistance of 153.4 tomorrow. 

Support- 144.9 -> 141.2 -> 138.5

Tesla is the wild child that no one wants to touch cause its so unpredictable. The biggest thing that happened today is that it failed to make a new daily low for the first time since October 31st. Many (me included) have been waiting for the bounce on telsa that just never came. We just might be looking at that bounce right now. With 190.9 clearly being resistance on Tesla we very well may be looking at our double top rejection. This daily hammer candle very well could result in a double top and further sell off tomorrow. 

Biggest thing to watch for tomorrow is whether Tesla closes below 188.3 or not which is the weekly 200ema. 

Support- 186.7 -> 177.4

Resistance- 194.3 -> 197 -> 201.8

Pretty impressive candle on the daily chart here for the VIX. The biggest drop as I said since May 4th. While the VIX was in much different levels back then something that is VERY intriguing to me is that today we dropped to about 22.84 and recoiled and the VIX closed right at that key 23.5 support level. I am a little surprised to see that on a 5.5% green day for SPY. Actually I am surprised that the VIX didn’t drop more like 15% especially when you consider that on big red days for CPI or other events we can see a 12-20% green day on the VIX. 

This 23.5 level is a big level. The VIX could be hinting to us that the markets are not as bullish as this rally today wants us to believe. I will be watching for a double bottom pop on the VIX tomorrow. 

**Where am I at right now? Bearish or bullish ?**

To be honest we couldn’t have had a worse outcome today. A beat on CPI just leads to even more speculation from the markets that the Fed is going to pivot/ slow rate hikes next meeting. However, the thing is that MoM inflation did not come down and while yes these were “beats” under expectation and under previous its hard to say after one good reading that we beat inflation. With SPY now being over the 75% retracement line of the bear channel the risk to reward to run calls up here is very low. However, this rally could last too long and we may never see an actual drop to pay out on puts now. I don’t forsee until next CPI/ FOMC any thing big enough to actually put the markets in sell off mode. While I do think we pullback a little just to naturally fill some of this wildness I don’t think itll be too sustained. But playing calls up here just seems like playing with fire too. We are definitely in a short term play area right now.

However, lets keep this in mind… 

CPI YoY- 7.7% puts us at the lowest reading since February which was 7.5%.  
 CPI MoM- 0.4% was under forecast but was the same as previous… that means inflation is still increasing… don’t get this confused… we did not DECREASE inflation… it just didn’t go up as much…  
 CORE YoY- 6.3% is a decrease but only puts us back at September CORE of 6.3%. that means we saw core go up for one month and then come back down to the previous months numbers.   
 CORE MoM- 0.3% means after two back to back months of 0.6% MoM CORE we did finally decrease….   
 

Now here is something that I already have on my radar and will be doing a lot of data diving into to figure out the best play for next CPI/ FOMC which is back to back (thinking we can really nail a banger). 

Lets chat really quickly to put it on our radars about the August drop in CPI and the august rally (mind you this is the ONLY other “beat” on cpi all year). 

In August CPI YoY beat at 8.5% coming down 0.2% form forecast and an impressive 0.6% from previous. The interesting thing about this prediction was that the forecast was so far below the previous with the 0.2% variance it woulda been incredible if we missed. Interestingly enough the following reading for September came in 0.2% over forecast of 8.1% but WAS a beat and decrease. Looking at the numbers for CPI YoY we have now had 5 readings in a row of CPI YoY decreasing… 

CPI MoM in august was forecasted at 0.2% and came in at 0%. This is the closest we have been to a decrease in inflation all year but we have still NOT gotten an actual negative reading for MoM. After the August 0% reading we had 0.1% -> 0.4% and now we have 0.4% again. So despite a BEAT of forecast CPI MoM has actually not seen a decrease to match CPI YoY. 

Since August CORE YoY of 5.9% which actually wasn’t even a beat from previous it was unchanged we had a 6.3% and now a 6.6% reading on YoY core. This reading was 0.2% beat from forecast and a 0.3% beat from previous. From the April CORE 6.5% reading until August we did see a decrease/ unchanged on core YoY. I will be closely watching to see if CORE YoY can unwind again or if we are going to go up. 

Core MoM was 0.3% in august which was a pretty impressive beat from the previous 0.7%. Much like CPI Mom we have not had a negative reading yet and we have not by any means tamed inflation but there has been slowing of CORE MoM unlike CPI MoM.

I am seeing a pretty big potential where we COULD get another good reading on inflation in December actually. Again everything comes down to the forecast. As long as the forecast comes in 0.2% below current actual readings so that would be forecast of CPI 7.5, CPI MoM 0.2, CORE 6.1 and CORE MoM 0.1% we actually could see another impressive beat and our first back to back green CPI days of the year. 

Now do I believe in real world that inflation is tamed? Absolutely not… no way… shit is so expensive its not funny and yeah used cars have come down (sucks more then It helps) new cars have not come down to match that used car drop. The biggest thing to watch for CPI on December 13th is 1. Will CPI YoY give its 5th consecutive drop, 2. Will CPI MoM and CORE MoM give their first negative readings (showing an actual decrease not just being unchanged) and 3. Will CORE cpi start the trend of coming down again.

The crazy bull case would be that we get back to back good readings on CPI come December 13th and then on December 14th while we still most likely get a 50bps this COULD give JPOW the fuel he needs to finally say the magical words to the market of “we are ready to slow hikes at the next meeting and see the full effect of our rate hikes.” A hinting at 25bps would be an pretty bullish thing and we could end up seeing December 13th and 14th turn into some impressively green two day rally based on that news. I will keep you guys posted and of course post a full trade plan and analysis/ breakdown for those two days.

Daily log- 

Today for me was an amazing day and for many in the server who played the strangle or amazingly played calls only the payout was phenomenal. After the morning win I did open one lotto put pretty early when things started to look heavy and that we wouldn’t take out 390 today, however, that quickly got wrecked. It was worth the risk to reward as I wouldn’t have in my wildest dreams expected a 5.5% green day on spy today. I am shocked we broke through 390 and that we kept pushing EOD even higher.

I played a few level to level plays on SPY but I couldn’t bring myself to scalp today. For me when we are at such an extreme and as much as I want to trust it to continue I struggle to believe in my plays which makes me struggle to believe in myself and I end up cutting early or cutting red when I shouldn’t have. Days like today are better left untraded for me. 

Tomorrow is going to be interesting to say the least. I wouldn’t put it past markets to not even look back and just straight push to gap fill 403 tomorrow but I more sensibly expect a 384 to 390 pullback.

New Twitter Inc. owner Elon Musk emailed his workers for the first time late Wednesday to prepare them for “difficult times ahead” and ban remote work unless he personally approved it.

Musk said there was “no way to sugarcoat the message” about the economic outlook and how it will affect an advertising-dependent company like Twitter, according to the email reviewed by Bloomberg News. The new rules, which kick in immediately, will expect employees to be in the office for at least 40 hours per week, he added.

Twitter has been under Musk’s leadership for close to two weeks, in which time he has dismissed roughly half its workforce and most of its executive suite. The new boss has upped the price for the Twitter Blue subscription to $8 and attached user verification to it. Musk told workers in the email that he wants to see subscriptions account for half of Twitter’s revenue.

Prior to Musk’s arrival, Twitter had established a permanent work-from-anywhere arrangement for its workers, many of whom had initially been pushed into remote work by the pandemic. It was one of the first topics in an all-hands call Musk held with Twitter staff after announcing the deal to buy the company earlier in the year. He said then that he’s against remote work and would only grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis, as he’s doing now.

He has also eliminated “days of rest” from Twitter staff calendars, Bloomberg News reported this month, which was a monthly, companywide day off introduced during the pandemic period. Its expiration gave another sign of Musk’s impatience with Twitter’s existing work culture.

“The road ahead is arduous and will require intense work to succeed,” Musk wrote in his missive to employees. In a separate email, he added that “over the next few days, the absolute top priority is finding and suspending any verified bots/trolls/spam.""",yrl1mh,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yrl1mh/let_the_brain_drain_begin_puts_on_tesla_just_cuz/,1668099545.0,2022-11-10 11:59:05,0.0

SPY

SPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday’s low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday’s low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.

QQQ

QQQ held Tuesday’s low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.

DIA

DIA also held Tuesday’s low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA’s weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders’ attitude towards the market. 

XLF

The financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.

XLI

XLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium. 

Most popular tech stocks ended in the red. Apple fell 3.32% on news that the company's first AR glasses have encountered design problems, affecting the 2024 launch. Microsoft fell 1.91 percent as the company faces a new EU antitrust complaint about its cloud computing business; European Union antitrust regulators have launched a sweeping investigation into Microsoft's $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.

Here is my forecast based on historical CPI data and analysis. There is a chance based on Cleveland fed all miss besides CPI Yoy though. It will be a very spicy open. But something interesting to keep in mind is that this is the reddest pre-CPI day we have had since June. And for those of you who remember pretty much before July we used to get an almost standard and expected 2% intraday sell off on SPY the day before CPI… it appears we just started that trend again. Tomorrow will be interesting to watch. 

Will keep todays TA brief as we will have a massive move either way and the dust will settle and we can decide where we could be headed next.

We did break through that 378 key level support which has held up and we also broke through the rising wedge on the daily that we have been trading within since the last CPI. Based on my calculations bull case puts SPY somewhere between 385.3 to 389.1 tomorrow and bear case puts us near 362.9 to 359.2. 

Key daily supports around this range is 365 -> 360 

Key daily resistance around this range is 384 -> 388.6

Regardless of what reading is we are about to see the next big move and direction for markets. If CPI beats and JPOW truly can say next meeting that “inflation has slowed” and “we see reason finally to slow rate hikes” then we are going to see a push toward 400-420 by next CPI and FOMC (December 12/13th). However, if CPI misses (especially core and or MoM) then what JPOW said about not having inflation tamed and that it is pre-mature to even consider slowing hikes right now is about to be sang on every new outlet. If we miss I think we head down towards 320-340 before the next CPI/ FOMC in December.

Apple just closed below its last CPI candle body low of 134.9. Today tech as a whole (besides meta) looked probably the worst it has looked In a very long time. This further tells me that a CPI miss is not price in and that tech especially will get absolutely slaughtered. 

Looking at previous CPIs 5-6% movement is possible on Apple that gives us a possible 127.8 to 126.5 tomorrow which would be a new 52 week low for Apple… actually Apple right here is 4.4% from its 52 week low at close of market today. This is the first close below 138.4 support level since June of this year. 

Support- 129.9 -> 125.8

Resistance- 138.5 -> 140.4 -> 142.1

Zoomed out on tesla is beyond ugly and I feel like this thing is just going to get driven down until it closes under $100/ share. Currently 172.2 support is the 2022 bear channel on Tesla if that level breaks then there is just the massive weekly bear channel left as you can see. This also potentially will be the first close under the weekly 200ema since October 2019.

The VIX remains hella underwhelming putting in a mild 2.15% green day on the eve of CPI. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the VIX somewhere between 27 and 28.3 at open tomorrow and we could breach 30 if CPI misses that big. 

Daily log- 

Honestly I struggled today with the technical. A lot of oversold indicators then pushing $1-$2 through that level to then reverse then push further. I got stopped out a few times only for it to go green and I didn’t close green for it to reverse on me too. Overall ended green thanks to a few scalps but tough day for me. 

See what tomorrow brings with CPI.

66,66,66,66,$TSLA's conundrum - Will Elon get fired?,"A few things first;

- Elon does not own above 50% of Tesla. 


- Elon can be fired from Tesla. 


- Elon is the main reason for TSLA shares to trade so high.


Question is, is it worth keeping him? 


If we solely think of stock performance as a sign of success and well being of a company, Elon can be considered a huge asset. Absurd price of the stock even today is only due to him being the CEO... well sort of was. The sentiment is quickly changing. 


IMO Elon's job at TESLA is done. The company is sustainable and cannot be outdone by other companies in the global market. Though competition in the Chinese market is too hot for any real benefit in the long run. 


In the recent earning report many people were pointing out how margins are falling and inventory was going up. 


These are products of high inflation and rising cost of materials. It's nothing out of the ordinary. The fact that the company is still able to grow is what you want to see in this economic climate. 


Toyota's lean inventory management was successful in the last 20 years due to stable commodity markets and a very efficient worldwide shipping network. Today these are both high affected by the pandemic and high inflation. To make it simpler for smooth brains. Cost of storing inventory may be lower than paying more for inventory every month due to highly volatile raw materials. Higher inventory is a sign of preparedness which I welcome.


IMO Tesla is here to stay and will still come out on top after the dust settles. 


But is TSLA a $200 - $300 stock? Not even close. I think it will land somewhere between $75-90. Many tech companies' valuations are garbage. Tesla will find its place in automotive industry though still be valued slightly above due to its brand recognition and the tech and solar power element of the company. 


It's just a matter of deciding when to part ways with Elon and not an if. 


This is just my two bananas. 


TL:DR Tesla may go down to $80/share but that's not necessarily something that will affect the company in a negative way. It may be a relief for management instead.",yqp3aw,6,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yqp3aw/tslas_conundrum_will_elon_get_fired/,1668014110.0,2022-11-09 12:15:10,1.0

That appears not to be the case as Tesla SEC filings show he sold substantial amounts of stock on the 4th, 7th and 8th of November in an untimely Tesla filing overnight:

74,74,74,74,"11-8-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Today was a bit of a rollercoaster if you ask me. But the one thing that we know for sure right now is that 1. 378 support like I mentioned is hella strong and 2. 384 is the next resistance level we have to take out. 

&#x200B;

The last 4 daily candles are completely ugly with all these massive wicks and huge ranges and volatility. But we reconfirmed 378 as support on that huge sell off intraday and I am looking for 388 to 390 tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day before CPI there is a very likely scenario where we trade between 378 and 384 all day in anticipation of CPI. This would be much like October 31st if that happens. However, if we look at September CPI (highlighted by the blue circle) despite the difference in candle structure we are actually seeing a VERY similar set up. We had a bounce off a key support level (September was 390 and now is 370.5) and that was followed by 4 green days (for a total of 5.5%... we are currently at 2.1%). We could see a bigger push tomorrow to that 390 level which would get us about 5.4% rally over 4 days prior to CPI. 

If you remember September the market was pretty bullish back then too and was under the anticipation that CPI would beat pretty bigly. However, it missed huge and back then much like now the market was Not prepared for a huge miss on CPI. 

When I look at the VIX now and IV compared to the last few CPIs the vix is extremely low and IV rank/ IV is very low. For instance today IV was around 30-32 which last CPI was 40-50. The market is not hedged for a huge miss or a huge CPI dump… I stand by if we get a big miss (read my cpi trade plan posted under pre-market analysis) that we might get our biggest red open and we might see a repeat of September also.

I didn’t talk about it under SPY but futures much like spy did break that FOMC resistance line today. We are holding that 3805 as support nicely, however, hard rejected at 3865. I am looking for futes to retest 3865 tomorrow and push for next major resistance at 3925. A rejection at 3925 and SPY 390 would actually form a really nice daily double top prior to a bad CPI reading and could be the “top” for a while.

Apple once again managed to hold that 138.3 support line and actually broke its steep red bear channel. With that tomorrow we can look for some upside and that 145 gap fill is still on the table if we get a big enough green day for markets.

And then there was tesla… once again another massively red sell off on tesla, however, this time it had a nice intraday recovery. Tesla is now down $37.05 in 3 days and $50.65 total over the last 6 days. That is a pretty insane sell off on Tesla.

Looking at the weekly ( I don’t usually talk about the weekly chart intraweek but this one is important to show). On that morning sell off Tesla hit its weekly 200ema. This is the first time Tesla has touched the weekly 200ema since October 2019. Even during the covid crash tesla never touched its 200ema on the weekly. It did touch and bounce aggressively off its 100ema though. 

If Tesla is going to bounce… this is the best chance it has. In addition unless Tesla opens under 182.4 -3.7% it will break its red dotted aggressive 3 day sell off resistance line and I believe attempt to go for its 197 gap fill tomorrow. 

Key support- 191.3-> 186.6 -> 172.5

The VIX is at a very interesting crossroads here… it is holding now in a consolidation pattern 24.4 to 25.8 and remains in its downward bear channel. 

The June CPI which from these levels resulted in a 3 day spike of the VIX for 32.1% was at 23.8 the day before CPI. The June 10th CPI resulted in a -1.66% open and closed down -2.9%.

The July CPI was at 25.79 two days before CPI and resulted in a smaller 11.3% spike over 3 today. The July CPI opened down -1.52% but closed only down -0.52%. 

The September CPI was at 22.64 two days before CPI and resulted in a 3 day spike of 19.6%. The September CPI opened down -2.2% (the reddest CPI open) and closed down -4.35%. 

We COULD expect a 21% spike on the VIX starting today through Thursday EOD. This means Thursday the VIX should hit 29.3. But realistically could end up somewhere between 26.9 and 31.9 on Thursday. We also COULD be looking for about a -1.79% red open (or somewhere between -1.5% to -2.2% Thursday morning) if CPI misses. 

The thing to keep in mind at least for me is that this market much like September is not in any shape or form position for a big miss. I also do not think if we do miss we see a repeat of October or July because back then we were at the 52week low and people were HEAVILY hedged with puts. But now that people are not positioned that way it will be much harder for us to rally intraday especially with the VIX so low.

I don’t study the P/C ratio as I feel its never helped and is just a data point but currently the P/C is 2.34% and the IV is 41.3% which is relatively low IV wise compared to the last CPI where were near 50. The call volume actually greatly outweighs the put volume (maybe someone can explain this better then me) but the actual put OI is much higher then the Call OI.

Today was a pretty good day… not going to lie not being greedy saved me about 4 different times from getting wrecked… I luckily opened that tesla call at a lotto size and was able to average down and get out with a smaller loss but still not great. 

Interestingly enough data wise for me today I went 100% with SPX scalps (weeks win rate is 90.9%), and my level to level plays intraday on spy were also 100% win rate (with the weekly win rate being 85.7% for just spy level to levels). However, I am 0 for 2 this week on tesla L2L plays and last week I hit 71.5% win rate… for the last two weeks for just Tesla L2Ls I am averaging 55.5% win rate…. For the last two weeks my P/L $ on Tesla L2Ls alone is -$389 and last week with my 71.5% win rate I had a P/L$ of $1279.

I had that 60% loss yesterday on Tesla (shoulda been cut at -30%) that if it was not for that I would be profitable on my L2Ls. But I like to anlayze my trades to see if what im doing is working or not. I will be keeping a close eye on this the rest of week and next week to see if there is a case to stop my Tesla L2Ls and stick to strictly SPY.

Despite the struggle almost all day for SPY to break through 370 resistance we finally saw spy break through before power hour and end the day extremely bullish. The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. 

However, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday.

Futures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It’s a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. 

If 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s.

Apple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill.

And then there was Tesla…. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. 

Highlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom.

The VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn’t hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days… the VIX has either closed red OR closed <1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart.

Looking at the fear and greed index… we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot… from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. 

The current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  

Januarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  
 Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  
 Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  
   
 

That would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days… that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th…. 

Now hear me out on this one which is even more WILD… December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)…. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible… 

Something to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week. 

Daily log- 

Today was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn’t miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it… though I wouldn’t have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all.

Something important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. 

The best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week… every trade is a new chance… If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. 

Something I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play. I don’t want to get in a habit of that with these level to levels even though I know sometimes they need time to mature… this COULD result in a lower win rate as I may stop out more BUT for instance today had I stopped out on my Tesla and SPY level to levels that closed very red I would have ended up very green today. 

Actually had a capped my L2L plays at -25% today for the two losers I would have only closed down -$50 for my L2L plays and with my $1249 from scalps today woulda ended the day up $1199 instead im ending it down about $103. 

Youtube will be up later!

83,83,83,83,"Trading ""Level to Level"" with Options","**How to Trade Level to Level**

This is a question I must get at least 10 times a day. So I am going to indepth do my best to explain to you guys what a Level to Level or L2L play is for me. 

The whole reason I started including more of these is that despite this being a scalpers market I realize its nearly impossible for someone to mirror a scalp. While it can be done the reward generally will never be as great as mine for the mirror. These plays are more of a set it and forget it sort of play and a play that due to the longer DTE and longer time held everyone can play them while still having a great risk to reward play. 

**Picking a DTE**

First off this is NOT a scalp this is a play that will usually take a while to develop and very well could develop overnight too. With that in mind that immediately means we need a slightly longer DTE to utilize. For SPY I prefer a 3-5dte, however, this also greatly varies on the actual way premiums and theta are hitting. When I play a Tesla or Apple L2L I prefer at least 3dte or longer. Since general stocks only expire on Fridays that means pretty much after Tuesday I will refer to the next weeks DTE. The issue especially with a stock like Tesla is that it moves like Wildfire so if you are wrong or the play does move against you then you will need to your way you will get wrecked before its ever worth it. 

You have to weigh a short enough DTE that the move nets you profits quickly but not so short that if the play takes time to develop as it usually does that you don’t end up missing out hugely. 

**Choosing the correct position size** 

This is the one tricky thing about the L2L plays. We have to chose a size big enough that the risk to reward is there and that we get a nice pay out. However, we can not immediately open such a large position size that we end up with a big loss if it goes against us. 

The way I enter my position sizes is of a normal scalp size (which is about $2000-$2500 for me). I like to open at least 50-75% immediately depending on how strongly I feel about the play. If I feel its going to be a pretty aggressive move and that im timing pretty much right before the bounce then I will open closer to 75% if not more and end up near $2000 for the trade. However, if like Friday I expect it to consolidate first possibly then I will usually start with about $1000-$1500 initially opened. This allows me to average down if I feel the play is valid and it holds my stop loss. 

But wait! DD you say averaging down a loser is just making a loser a bigger loser!? Correct! I did say that… however, that applies mostly for a scalp. I NEVER add to my scalps because those are 0dte… And those are pretty much hit or miss. I either immediately hit profits and close or im pretty much immediately wrong too. So averaging that down is not smart. However, this play factors in an average down on purpose and also uses clear support/ resistance levels to average down. 

**When to stop loss out**

The thing about these level to level plays that I enjoy is that they have a built in stop. So let me post an example of that from Friday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyxlirrs5dy91.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c334066f4339df0ea6f1b3621210da0c8aed6c2a

So here you can see I already KNEW that my stop loss was going to be if a candle closes below 370.6. Now you gotta be forgiving with this too. So within reason because we did have a candle close near 370.5. So if we had closed under 370 I would have closed this play. The important thing I factor into this also is that I want my stop loss to be somewhere around 20% still. That’s just how my risk to reward and win rate works. I don’t want one L2L loss to wipe out numerous L2L wins. 

**When to average down?** 

Lets take a look at a Tesla L2L I took on Friday also and this will be a great example of a time where averaging down works. Friday when tesla on the daily had appeared to be holding 210 support and forming a nice double bottom I entered a 7dte ATM Call. My take profit target was near 215 to 219.3. Looking back at the daily and weekly charts I know that Tesla for the last 2 weeks has broken through 205.6 support numerous times but everytime it has popped back up and refused to close below it. So what I did was purposefully make my stop loss closing UNDER 205.6 EOD. This gave me enough room where at the LOD I still only saw about -30% 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke1qvu9t5dy91.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2afd0346939b4b734eba1c269086788d3729de0

Okay above you can see my call out on the play. Now lets look at how it actually played out intraday. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ud60poqt5dy91.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d77f12eb18e0ec03fda6482dfa1f8baa974a58

So with this Tesla L2L you REALLY had to trust the levels. You had to trust that even though we broke key support that we were going to see a recovery by EOD which has historically happened time and time again. This was a great Risk to reward play as this is probably one of the strongest levels tesla has. 

Now looking back I could have absolutely waited for 205.6 support test before initially entering the play, but on Friday you can see we had that massive sell off after a strong morning and we had bounced off that key 210 support are intraday and was appearing to recover. The one thing looking back that I DID misplay on this was not waiting for the candle to break back over the 5ema before entering this play. However, leaving room to average down and knowing the key levels we can be a little aggressive and sometimes snag a more reward in doing so if we recognize the risk. 

So here once EOD we broke back over that 205.6 level and closed back over the 5ema I was able to average down on my call. I did end up hitting exactly break even at one point EOD before the choppiness hit. With this support level being so strong I felt comfortable swinging this over the weekend. Knowing that we could retest 205.6 but most likely would bounce but after that EOD recovery I expect to see a bigger push up at open Monday to look for an exit. 

**How I choose the play**

The way I choose my level to level plays is based off daily price action along with current intraday price action. What I am looking for is when we find a key support area on the daily chart that the intraday 15min chart is then finding support at. 

Lets take a look at another example from Friday 11/4/22 on SPY. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0l8hhl9u5dy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=989b59106a6c151a892065b2d55b64a1066306cd

Taking a look at Friday here is a L2L play that I made on Friday. So you can see I clearly have highlighted in purpose 370.6 as a key support. This is one of my levels established from my TA on the SPY daily chart. What I saw here is that after the massive morning sell off we bounced hard off 370.6 and continued to hold all candles closing over this level. We had about 10 candles bounce off this level total. When I saw this extremely strong support establishing around this level I knew it was time to enter a LEVEL TO LEVEL play. 

The first thing and most important thing is we have to chose a DTE. For me I chose a 5DTE. Why did I choose a 5DTE? When we first bounced and double bottomed off the 370.6 level at noon I Did expect a big bounce back up near that 374.9 resistance, however, I knew it could consolidate there first (which is exactly what ended up happening). Had I taken a 0dte play here by time EOD that move up finally happened I would have been. 

Now that I chose the correct DTE we have to set our TP target and our Stop loss target. 

Take profit will for a call play be the next resistance which in this case is 374.9. 

Stop loss target as I mentioned was a FULL candle closed below 370.6. As breaking that key support would signal a bigger downside to come on SPY. On the daily 370.6 is actually a huge level support that separates periods of price action. 

Once we enter the play do we diamond hand it or do we take profits when we can? Well this is where things get tricky. In the end PROFITS are KING.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f2i8xru5dy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c11ab6d8601a1e50a9822ba71a35e2b76169eb16

Here is what it looks like for me at least on a few different L2L plays from earlier Friday morning. As you can see for these I actually entered a 3dte and 5dte on SPY (I actually usually do this to show you guys the difference in pay out not so much because I wanna play it both ways) but for tesla I did enter the 0dte because in the morning that’s how strongly I felt about the play and knew it would hit quick but would let the 7dte tesla play out longer.

Usually I look for at least 10% but if I recognize that things have turned against me then I will exit for a much smaller gain. There is no reason to let a play go red… 3% green is better then -20% red. 

Generally I will just add some stop limit orders as you can see and I will continue to increase that level as price moves in my direction. And if it stops me out green well it’s a win either way! Now the issue here is that many many times I stop out way before the actual L2L ever fully plays out. Which means I miss out on a HUGE win, however, if you look at the first stop limits here I was playing the 374.9 support to 378 breakout and got a nice win. I really thought we were going to see a huge green day and very well could have let those run think we see 380-385. However, had I done that on Friday I would have taken a massive loss on that sell off. 

I would say the biggest risk on these L2L plays is that we can not use a hard fast and set stop loss. If we do at say -20% like we usually do then we may stop out before key support actually holds and the play develops. However, when the key support or resistance against us breaks we have to exit and be okay accepting the loss. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vvzvvgcv5dy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd185965e1d499dd583550d28838e566ef2b9eb8

Here is an example of when I actually followed my own stop loss and had I actually diamond handed it this play the very next candle would have been back to profits. However, we HAVE to be mechanical in trading. We cant be smarter then the candles or the charts. IF the play fails it fails. If it comes back to life after we close it… then that’s something we can consider and something to take into play about perhaps using a looser stop loss next time but in my opinion for every play that came back from the dead there are 10 that never came back. My losers that I have held that never come back GREATLY outweigh those that come back to life.

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -> 363.6 -> 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -> 408.6

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&#x200B;

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -> 3705 -> 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -> 4085

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -> 133.3 -> 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -> 147.1 -> 150.8

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support.

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -> 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -> 245

&#x200B;

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope.

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me.

90,90,90,90,Nasdaq Puts and P911 Calls,"Hey guys!

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

I’m happy to hear about your opinions :)",ym7pet,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ym7pet/nasdaq_puts_and_p911_calls/,1667589467.0,2022-11-04 15:17:47,1.0

94,94,94,94,"11-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well the day after the FOMC meeting proved to be pivotally boring. After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though.

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -> 365 -> 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -> 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right? 

Key support- 138.2 -> 135 -> 130

Key resistance- 142.2 -> 144.8

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow. 

Key support- 214.9 -> 210 -> 205.6

Key resistance- 219.3 -> 226.1

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

I took the 389C overnight and that was looking rough for a really long time this morning. Thankfully with the rogue pump before FOMC and then the 2pm pump that was expected I exited for a pretty decent win. Not the best exit but when its moving like that it’s the best you can do for sure. 

That pump also allowed me as expected to exit my now 5dte 386C too for almost 20% win.

I did follow my plan of the 234pm calls. I entered and hit 30% profits pretty much instantly… unfortunately that was where the music stopped playing for me. I fully expected based on movement that we were going to see a really big bullish break out on SPY after the 230 presser as historically has happened. However, it dumped pretty much immediately after I entered. I never saw green again and there was no sense to average down or try to do anything silly. 

If you were okay with small profits it did hit, however, if you weren’t fast it turned into a loss.

Someone asked me last night “why don’t you present a bearish case too?” well until today there wasn’t really a reason to present one. What do I mean by that? Well we had been holding this red bull channel for over 3 weeks now. There was little reason to bet against that until we saw like now a breakdown of that support. 

With SPY now breaking through that green channel support of 378.1 and not only that it also rejected the attempted break through of 388.6 resistance I do favor a bearish case now. With the blue resistance line and red bull channel support line there was also a rising wedge formed that has now broken. 

From here we look at our key levels which will be that 378.1 resistance level. If SPY can break back through there and close over that level tomorrow there actually could be a case made that today was some massive over reaction and we are going to see a reversion to mean break to the upside 385 range tomorrow. However, if we back test and reject 378.1 that is even more confirmation of downside to come. 

If you remember since last CPI the media was screaming a fed pivot and a fed slowing of rate hikes. Overall JPOW effectively just said that is NOT happening right now but in the future will happen. With that narrative now squashed where are we going to go next? The next thing on the Agenda is CPI on November 10th which so far we still do not have a consensus on core or CPI yet. However, monthly CPI is consensus of 0.7 which would be a 0.3% rise over previous MoM. I expect that CPI to release soon and I expect that could absolutely move the markets. 

Key support- 374.6 -> 370.5 -> 365

Key resistance- 378.1 -> 379.9 -> 384.1 -> 388.6

Futures does not look any better then SPY and has broken through the red bull channel support also and landed at 3760 support. This will be the next support that bears what to try to take out. Bulls will look to get this back over 3865 by EOW if they want to remain bullish going forward. 

One major bearish thing we can take away here is that this week effectively was a daily 100ema rejection and now huge break down through daily 8 and 20ema. The bearish case is rising in strength. 

Key support- 3705 -> 3675 -> 3585

Apple actually was the last domino to fall today and even more interestingly about Apple it has officially broken through the bottom from Friday. That huge green day that Apple had on Friday is now completely gone and then some. 

With this bull channel now broken we are looking at downside obviously now too. It is hard to tell in this picture because if I zoomed out too far it would be hard to see the candles but we are actually seeing quite a bit of red. Looking at the daily you can see that 150.6 is the KEY pivot level of bullish vs. bearish and we are seeing a pretty aggressive rejection of the daily 100 and 200ema which I mentioned earlier would take a few trading days to play out. 

Key support- 144.7 -> 141.1 -> 138.2 

Key resistance- 149.2 -> 150.6 -> 153.4 -> 155.4

They really did massacre my girl Tesla today. I was actually impressively bullish on tesla with that closure over key 230 and the candle body over the daily 20ema which fully closing over the daily 8ema.

What would a -2.5% red day on SPY be without the VIX closing barely green at 0.12%... Well I had imagined they were unwinding the VIX for FOMC and especially for CPI next week, however, I would have expected to see a reaction on the VIX especially with this dump. There is clearly still fear and unknown in this market thanks to JPOW today, however, the VIX didn’t really react. Will it react tomorrow? Or is this going to end up being a straight volume dump with VIX once again being detached? 

Daily log- 

Well I am going to start doing these a little differently! I am going to start a 2.5k 10% take profit/ 20% stop loss challenge. So EOD you will see me post my daily log and post results of a 2.55k challenge. I will probably end up making a separate post for the 2.5k challenge also. For me usually my first trade of the day is my best trade so I will utilize my first entry for the trade. I will use the full $2500 per trade (well as close as I can) and I will update this via Excel like my normal port. 

&#x200B;

I will start the challenge tomorrow just going to move a few things around in my accounts. Now the thing with this is that it is NOT about full porting… that’s absolutely not what im doing this for and $5000 is not a full port for me. What I am doing instead is hoping to show you guys whether its $500, $1000, $2500, $10,000, etc. etc. If you have proper strategy and risk management and take small profits those small profits will add up over time. This is to show you compound growth. Yes one loss of 20% does set you back two 10% wins, but if you continue to trade the $2,500 it adds up and recovers fairly quickly. 

This is not a full port as I said… I will be utilizing $2,500 PER TRADE so as you see above the starting “balance” is $2,500 but that’s not all that is in there. In the future I may do another one of just one trade a day starting with like $5,000 or something in the account and attempt to grow that… the same premise remains though that as long as you maintain a good strategy one loss really only takes 2-3 trades to over come. With premiums being so ridiculous right now it’s a little hard to use less then $2,500 and even some days $2,500 will be a stretch but like I said it will be as close to $2,500 as it can be. 

I will continue to trade normally in my other account doing day traders/ scalps and of course my level to levels.

Not my best day but not my worse day. The important lesson today was no matter how highly probable a trade is… it can ALWAYS go against you and not only that… it is only a high probability trade if we remember to take profits. These trades that are the “big hitters” have to be lotto size and you have to understand that as you see above there is a chance it goes straight to zero.

&#x200B;

U.S. markets will be closed for Thanksgiving, and markets are open for just a half day on Black Friday.

&#x200B;

The move higher in stocks comes amid a busy day for economic data, with reads on the labor market, housing market, and manufacturing sector all coming out early Wednesday.

&#x200B;

The latest data on weekly jobless claims showed 240,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the most since mid-August. Economists expected initial claims to total 225,000 for the week ending November 19.

&#x200B;

Durable goods orders for October were also released early Wednesday, showing orders rose 1% last month against expectations for a 0.4% increase, according to data from Bloomberg.

&#x200B;

S&P Global's preliminary read on business activity in November showed a continued slowdown in economic output, with the firm's manufacturing PMI falling to a 30-month low, while service sector activity hit a three-month low. S&P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist Chris Williamson said Wednesday these reports are consistent with an economy contracting at an annualized rate of 1%.

&#x200B;

Consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan showed consumers remain downbeat about their prospects, with the index falling 5% from October to a reading of 56.8, down from 59.9. ""Along with the ongoing impact of inflation, consumer attitudes have also been weighed down by rising borrowing costs, declining asset values, and weakening labor market expectations,"" said Joanne Hsu, direct of the survey of consumers.

&#x200B;

On the housing front, new home sales unexpectedly increased in October, rising 7.5% to an annualized rate of 632,000, much faster than the 570,000 annualized rate expected by economists.

&#x200B;

The minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting are also set for release on Wednesday afternoon to round out a busy economic calendar.",z2sw10,22,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z2sw10/stocks_rose_tsla_soared_dow_climbed_ahead_of_fed/,1669219396.0,2022-11-23 11:03:16,0.0

105,105,105,114,"My Full Plan for this Week 11/21 + Challenge Update (3 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event , 4 Stocks)","Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays.

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918**Port % Change**: 102%

We are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, i currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* SPXW 12/06/2022 4100.00 C
* TSLA 11/25/2022 180.00 C
* TWST 04/21/2023 25.00 P

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so they pulled the account value down, i got alot of time on most of these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on.

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much.

# Major Economic Events

**Wednesday 11/09**

8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct9:45 AM S&P PMI Flash Nov2:00 PM FOMC Minutes

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

# Earnings

# Monday 21 Nov

**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 & Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.

# Tue 22 Nov

**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.032 & Revenue $10.3B
* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings
* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell

# Wed 22 Nov

**Before Open - Deere & Company ($DE)**

* Industrial
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $7.12 & Revenue $13.5B
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.

Other notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

https://preview.redd.it/5b822iml471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe7ca2769c4f20251ab7413e26ee0305c6452ee9

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

https://preview.redd.it/se5xtv8m471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49615a9f7b4f176a5517366fb5f1fde90cb3ec6

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

https://preview.redd.it/04ud0cwm471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e7d0bb3d61d723824c57302a3b727410c5560c5

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

https://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9c67c9f39558996148549530fec9a8ca90d2fbb

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

I wish you all a very green week!",z0jw08,43,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z0jw08/my_full_plan_for_this_week_1121_challenge_update/,1668989510.0,2022-11-20 19:11:50,0.0
106,106,106,115,Musk's Twitter moves are a masterful gambit. Calls on TSLA.,"Here's what Elon has done in the past couple weeks at Twitter.

* **Fired key executives:** Eliminated those responsible for Twitter's key problem of being a bot haven
* **""Hardcore"" rallying call**: Eliminates unnecessary bloat and keeps dedicated workers
* **Starting & stopping $8 program**: A short demonstration to advertisers that Twitter is no longer cow-towing to special interests
* **Publicly fires critics:** Shows he isn't a spineless leader and is willing to take decisive action
* **Asks for print-outs of code:** Puts his engineers on notice that he is scrutinizing their work and they need to be able to defend it

All of these actions display a level of decisiveness and ruthlessness that was lacking in Twitter's leadership. This also bodes well for TSLA, which is down nearly 20% in the last 30 days.

Investors have mispriced TSLA, and the stock will rebound as Musk's masterful turnaround of Twitter becomes more apparent.

TSLA will mean-revert to $300 by January.",yzahl3,0,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yzahl3/musks_twitter_moves_are_a_masterful_gambit_calls/,1668859881.0,2022-11-19 07:11:21,1.0
107,107,107,117,TSLA now trading below book value? (can a real expert chime in?),"Calling real experts/highly intelligent finance bros to check this very simple thought process

Q1 2022 GAAP net income - 3.3B
Q2 - 2.3B
Q3 - 3.3B
Q4 — assumption of at least matching Q3, so 3.3B

Total = 12.2B

Assuming a conservative 50x PE

Book value = 610B or $203 per share

Currently trading at ~540B or ~180/share

So even in this market of PE compression, we’re below book value on TSLA right?

111,111,111,122,"The Bull Case for ASTS, SpaceX (TSLA), ad infinem","After news of Russian missiles landing in Poland, let's discuss why space satellites would be the best bet going forward into the next world war.

1. Who bothers with space? Does Russia control their space-space?Will they shoot down commercial satellites hovering above them? NO
2. Communications are vitally important during wartime. However, infrastructure tends to... not survive when giant exploding dildos are flying everywhere. Because of point 1, therefore, space antennae become even more important. 
3. That's where space mobile communications comes into play:

ASTS had an earnings call yesterday, along with news that they have 'unfurled' their test antennae in space. BULLISH NEWS! This is the beginning of giant green dildos, brothers! 

SpaceX already had their WiFi satellites in space, and have already deployed them in Ukraine via their Starlink product. 

Currently in the world, only a handful of private companies are doing such endeavors, and these two companies have the highest profiles in the space. On top of being able to quickly and more cheaply access customers in rural or desolate areas, this will ALSO enable good communications in a war-zone as well.

Love you all, and wish you all the best. For everyone asking what my next moves are here it is:

As of right now, I believe the bear market rally is coming to an end. Maybe there is a bit more upside, but I don't want to miss the downside. I personally like the risk-to-reward here.

TA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200 day SMA SPY,  FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \~3490, sentiment etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally. Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on.

I am short 

NFLX

CMG

GS

My only long position is $ASTS right now, which I trimmed today bigly.

**But be aware, I will scale in and out of these short positions on a whim. I have a HUGE short/long watchlist, and if I sense there is money to be made elsewhere I will rotate my money.**

Stuff on my watchlist

$AAPL

$TSLA

$TMUS

$CAT

$DE

$LI

and a ton of other stocks.

This is not financial advice, this is for the people curious about what my next move is. 

Also, I don't recommend anyone to short as the asymmetry is against you when shorting. Your losses can be infinite, while your gains are capped at 100% (unless using leverage). Good luck my fellow brethren.

Ok, so Elon paid about 45bn on this deal. He had 20bn in cash sitting around apparently. He doesn´t want to sell TSLA stock for the other 25bn, so he takes loans instead. So far so good.

From the 25bn loans, 13bn are just regular loans and 12bn are just margin loans using TSLA stock as collateral. This is the first thing I don´t understand. Why only 12bn are margin loans? Why would the banks accept to loan 13bn with no collateral?

And the collaterals, are they a specified number of shares or a specified dollar worth of shares?

Then there's the fact that the Twitter company itself got leveraged to the tits during the deal? How? Was it just a clause in the contract that the company had to take a lot of leverage beforehand or Elon wouldn't buy it?

   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 49 (+96%)
   * Net sellers increased from 200 to 345 (+73%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 31st - November 4th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 24th - October 28th.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

As always, appreciate any feedback that you have on the reports, stats, etc.

133,133,133,158,"All my money is stuck in FTX, and I am insolvent","Hi guys, allow me to share my story.

I'm 37. Asian male. Single. Ex-SWE

During the peak of the 2021, I became a millionaire. I went all in with my 300k on TSLA in beginning of 2020, and it ended up shoot up to 1.5mil at the peak. Overnight, I became a millionaire without doing much other than clicking a few things in my browser. That gave me confidence. That gave me thinking that I am the shit. I quit my job since I actually never liked SWE, and said I'm gonna do my on thing. I started dabbling in C and put majority of my winnings there.

Then it dropped by 60% during the recent crashes. I still had around 400k in C, and I basically stopped trading at a point and put all of that into USDC. Only that it was all in FTX and now I can't draw them out.

I don't know what's gonna happen, but right now I'm sitting at 10k liquid in my bank. I thought I was a confidence millionaire, and all the sudden things went upside down.

This is scary. All the sudden, things just went to 0. Everything I had worked for suddenly came crumbling down.

So I went from being a confident millionaire to a terrified crybaby. I don't know what's gonna happen, but this is where I am now.

Everything -- gone, just like that.

I wanna say im fine, but its slowly settling in on me.

But someone dawned on me. A realization. An epiphany.

The way I had been going with my life is entirely backwards. I viewed money as important, but in the end it isn't. When I became a millionaire, I thought it'd be world changing. It isn't. I wasn't any different, but having the lottery money gave me some confidence, and I ran with it. But now, gone with the crashes of 2022. I'm now jobless, savingless, and the prospects for finding a SWE job seems daunting amongst layoffs.

It just showed me how wrong I've been living life. Completely backwards. I never liked SWE and just did it for the money. With that money I invested into stocks and C, and did well. With that money, I upgrade my life, my tastes, etc. But deep down I wasn't happy nor fulfilled.

This all made me realize that I've been building my life on sand, and it's all been an illusion. Money, better life, upgrades, all these external things are just an illusion. Why was I chasing after all these? How did I end up in this mess?

And, for the first time in a long time, I prayed. Surrendering myself, and prayed.

And strangely enough, I don't feel so bad anymore.

All these external things -- chasing after money, luxury, materialism -- really don't mean much anymore. These are the wrong metrics to evaluate my life. And letting these go, freed me from the weight of thinking about them.

From now, the metric I go by is how much I am helping others with my heart and skills. Doing this really makes me feel fulfilled.

I have recently been dabbling with creators, and I completed a writing cohort and I've been helping out here and there. I feel very alive and fulfilled doing so.

So now I want to measure myself by how much I am helping others, building the **social credit or goodwill**, as the currency. I am going to give more than I take. I'm letting go of the obsession w/ money, and instead of focusing on helping ppl with my unique talents.

I am not scared of my future, because I know this new path is a more fulfilling one to embark on.

\---

If you are impacted by these market meltdowns, i hope this message finds you and may be of help for you. These are true tests to see who you really are

&#x200B;

===

Update 1 --a) I'm getting a lot of DMs from ppl who reached out and gave me a lot of supportive and positivity. I am truly grateful for you guys in times like this. My faith in humanity is truly restored. 1 redditor actually took me out in NYC and bought me dinner. Thank You.

b) as much as how bad this event is, I'm actually am ok. I do have some savings left to keep me afloat for while, and I have family and friends who can support me in different ways. Also, I am actually working a side project that I am very passionate about -- have been working on it for a few months, and it definitely takes my mind off of all this craziness. This just showed me that working on what i'm passionate about and trying to build a biz out of it is more fulfilling, and all the degen speculations don't mean much to me.

c) What's done is done, theres no point in ruminating about it so all we can do is to move on. Of course getting swept by these tsunami sucks, and it's really out of my control and I dont know how the future is going to play out. So I'm just gonna completely move on and focus on my project.

d) in times like this, we all can be better and support each other. Some of you redditors gave me support + positivity that I couldn't get in real life, so thank you.

e) SBF and these crooks destroyed our trust and faith in humanity, But lets not let that define us. Let's restore faith in humanity together and make a comeback together.

f) I admit i suck at all these trading/investing/speculating things -- it's too complicated and I don't have the passion to study/master it like some the guys here in WSB. So admit I got lucky w/ TSLA and am retarded w/ how I am managing my portfolio. Better to work on things I care about and can get gud at.

In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

We  absolutely crushed it! So missed $TWLO that was a bad play, $TSLA never  ran to $250 but some profit was made there, if you got out early (i  didnt). And $NFLX & $PIN never triggered, so no play.

But earnings plays $CVNA $SQ $ROKU $ETSY $AMD (everyone thought this wouldnt run) $MRNA all were home runs.

Economic  events FOMC meeting went as planned too everyone said 75bps would sell  off, but it ran as expected, then we played the Speech as went along.

Watchlist, $DB, $SPY also played out as expected, so all in all good week!

# Major Economic Events

**Tuesday 11/08**

Midterm Elections

**Wednesday 11/09**

11:00 AM Inventories MoM Sep

**Thursday 11/10**

8:30 AM CPI Oct

9:30 AM Inflation Rate YoY Oct

9:30 AM Core Inflation Rate YoY Oct

9:30 AM Inflation Rate MoM Oct

9:30 AM Core Inflation Rate MoM Oct

9:30 AM Intial Jobless Claims till 5 Nov

**Friday 11/11**

11:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment

Obviously  all these are important, but the only one we would be interested in  playing would be the CPI day. You can play CPI day 2 ways

**Option 1:**

Wait  for the results, after the initial drop or jump, the day usually  follows the same direction, you dont have to guess, and you would make  the ALOT of $$ by waiting it out and picking direction after that. If  you play same day options, chop might kill your plays anyway. This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.

**Option 2:**  
Speculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody’s chart  below.

https://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d

So  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)

So that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed’s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  ‘’influncers’’ would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.

The  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  
Remember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much. So play accordingly.

# Earnings

Monday 07 Nov

**After Close - Lyft Inc ($LYFT)**

* Transportation
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.069 & Revenue $1.056B
* Options pricing in a 18.6% move on earnings
* My  Play: Very bearish flow and $UBER earnings results were mixed too (ran  because of guidance & bookings), going with the flow here, they laid  off alot of employees not a great sign. Taking ATM puts today

Tue 08 Nov

**After Close - Affirm Holdings Inc ($AFRM)**

* Technology/Internet Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $-0.842 & Revenue $360M
* Options pricing in a 25% move on earnings
* My  Play: Almost all banks beat, $HOOD beat, $SOFI beat, very bullish flow,  im going with ATM calls for this one, corelation doesnt equal  causation, anything can happen, if you want to play safe you still make  ALOT of money with a straddle given the 25% implied move.

**After Close - Walt Disney Company ($DIS)**

* Consumer Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.554 & Revenue $21.3B
* Options pricing in a 8.3% move on earnings
* My  Play: Overly bullish flow, my gut says they miss with the $NFLX beat,  and China Park shutdown, but im going with flow on this one maybe there  is something i dont know.

Wed 09 Nov

**Before Open - Roblox Corpartion ($RBLX)**

* Technology/Packaged Software
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $-0.31 & Revenue $692.2 million
* Options pricing in a 17.4% move on earnings
* My  Play: Flow looks ugly lots bearish activity, they have been missing for  a long time and they are still overvalued, going with the flow taking  puts.

Thu 10 Nov

**Before Open - AstraZenca PLC ($AZN)**

* Health Care/Biotechnology
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS 0.758 & Revenue $10.78 billion
* Options pricing in a 5.2% move on earnings
* My  Play: Will probably end up skipping this, not a crazy move here as most  pharmas already reported, they almost all beat, so calls would be the  play here

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**  
Looks  like the market might be bullish till CPI, $TSLA Held $203.84 Support  as long this line holds, first TP for me will be $216.8 and then $224

**- $AMD Long/Short**  
Has  not been able to break throught the $62.7 level since earnings, pretty  much in a channel now, if it breaks resistance will go long, if it cant  will short till next support at $60

https://preview.redd.it/p0gb25n4oiy91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d05e6b5ae9e4dfc0b496c9e6fbb5b2a848593300

**- $VIX Long**

Lot  of chatter lately about VIX big spike coming soon, while i personally  dont see it, the trend lines we drew 4 month ago, remain respected so my  play here, is if we break and hold $25.6 resistance ill take calls, if  that fails we are likely going back to retest the trend and likely break  it all the to $22 at which point i would take profits

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Im  not going to add something just to have a play, i couldn’t find  anything, SPX will for sure be 10X play on CPI day, but beyond that i  got nothing this week. But i will 100% find a good for next week.

Alright,  so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going  through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice

First off, I'd like to thank u/Phx-Jay for bringing this company to my attention.  
I've spent the weekend analyzing a potential play here and my results are as follows.

* I know you regards are too autistic to understand financial statements, so I'll leave the executive summary below (*as opposed to walking through their B/S, I/S, Cash Flow, etc...*)
* Their net income has had a very wild swing for both 3 months and 6 months ending in June 30th.
* Three month change is *negative 140%*
* Six month change is *negative 148%*

* You can also see that their revenue has increased due to advertising campaigns executed per client. This is why the stock pumped on last earnings.

[Revenue increase from last earnings, but expenses are now much greater.](https://preview.redd.it/8cp7tw5rhfy91.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d79ae8c1979eb46d2a2cfeef2679023df63ee49)

* As their revenue increased, so did their expenses which eclipsed whatever additional revenue came in at that time. Here is a breakdown of their increased expenses.

# Price per Earnings Ratio

* As most of you know, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the company's annual earnings per share.
* As of November 4th, TTD has a P/E ratio of 660.71
* Trend shown below for reference ([https://ycharts.com/companies/TTD/pe\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/TTD/pe_ratio))

* Just for comparison's sake, TSLA has a P/E ratio of 66.42

&#x200B;

# Forward Guidance

* It's no secret that advertisement revenue is down from the big tech companies
* $META's advertising revenue declined 27.2 Billion, down \~4% YoY.
* [https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/11/02/amazon-freezing-hiring-advertising.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/11/02/amazon-freezing-hiring-advertising.html)
* Inflation, rising overhead, reduce spending by corporate.
* Forward guidance will be the primary reason for tanking this dog with fleas.

149,149,149,180,"TGIF: TSLA gain (not the minimum required for me to tag gain, but here are some of my thoughts).","I hope you all are well! I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

156,156,156,189,ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (I),"# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

[BlueWalker 3 satellite and the ASTS team](https://preview.redd.it/33cpnveensx91.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7059c581f68dd7f8adb8bb5663bea60f99ba61e1)

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

The BELIEVERS:

* Rakuten, American Tower, Vodafone (along w Samsung) did ASTS Series B then PIPE ($230M) investments.
* Mikitani Hiroshi is billionaire Rakuten CEO backing ASTS with a massive stake.
* Transhumanica with a detailed research paper that I highly recommend. They have an interactive valuation model with a $114 current PT.
* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.
* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you’re interested in reading a negative scenario case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better.

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.
