0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Only a $MTTR of time,"I'm tired of this shet damit. 

I've been a Matterport bull since before the merger. If you wanna read more in depth what they do:

[Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/owofq2/the_stock_that_mttrs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7o7h0/youre_still_not_getting_it_whats_the_mttr_with_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

tl;dr summary of product: Personalized and well detailed Google Earth for your whatever the hell you wanna Google Earth of.

# Financials:

Bruh. They have like [almost 500 million](https://investors.matterport.com/static-files/a6399263-2769-42b9-9b0f-e9b5ebfce583) in cash and a MC of 900 mill....

Here, you have companies scared shetless when rates are up and then there's Matterport who doesn't even need to borrow with that amount of cash on hand. 

Their ARR up, subscription up, revenue up. 

# The Real Estate Dilemma

""My home is worth less than my portfolio, real estate market is tanking, this company is screwed""

dude. IT ISN'T A DILEMMA. THIS TRASH REAL ESTATE MARKET IS THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR MATTERPORT. Mr. Joe Shmoe who bought his 1b/1b for 5x asking price is getting more and more desperate to sell to any buyer. In order to try to beat the other sellers, what option does Joe have? Matterport his house. 

Hurricanes destroyed your house and you needa rebuild? Matterport to preview, design, and insure your house.

About a year ago, I equated Matterport to a shovel play. Matterport isn't a shovel play. Shovels only spike during the gold rush, It's an alcohol play. 

You find gold? you party and you drink.

You don't find gold? You cry and you drink more.

Kid's birthday? Drink

Whatever the hell event: YOU STILL DRINK.

Regardless of real estate, with more people deciding to rent than own because of the market, renters would still want to see and explore a location before they decide. 

Need to rent a venue? Decide where to travel to? Same thing. 

# The Facebook Dilemma:

How is this a dilemma? In fact, if anything the single reason meta is down should be the same exact thing pumping Matterport. Mr. Zuck has basically said fuck it to all the other parts of his company except the sector dealing with MATTERPORT.

# Shorts:

My opinion here, but Matterport is in a situation that is super easy to see negatively. ""The growth tech stock that is deeply rooted in the real estate market and has partnered with $META..."" Everything in that description screams short candidate.

I really don't know how accurate this is and I have no idea how to verify, but fintel says SI is [46.48% SHORT?!?!](https://fintel.io/ss/us/mttr) 

However, despite the opinion MTTR keeps beating expectations and is getting completely dogged on, imo, just because of the sector they're in. 

&#x200B;

I don't wanna push any likelihood of a squeeze, but I do think that it is currently way undervalued and has at least some potential to squeeze up. (especially if fintel data is remotely accurate, which it probably isn't, iunno. My brain hasn't a wrinkle in sight.)

# Positions:

I HODL'ed past the 4x gain because I'm some random unknowledgable retail investor who became an expert Jan '21 because yes. but I do believe in the company and their product. \~5000 shares, avg 6.25 and Ima keep averaging down if I can get that Wendys offer letter.

&#x200B;

NFA Im poor enough; don't sue.

Also open to any other thoughts. I may have missed something or not understood something. 

&#x200B;

As always; ending saving the most bullish remarks for the end:

1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Is Meta the long term play of the century?,"I may be one of the most bearish people I know right now ($220 SPY puts 2025 and I think I’ll be comfortably ITM), but if I was going to invest in a single tech stock honestly it would be Meta right now. Don’t get me wrong Zuckerberg is running that company in the ground with Meta. However, eventually he’s going to take such a big financial hit he’s open to dropping Meta. “But he’s already lost hundreds of billions” you are probably saying. Here’s the thing though, he still has FUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKKK YOOOOOOUUUUUU MONEY. That’s put your dick on the table, and stare everyone straight in the eyes while you do it money. The money he’s left with at this point is still so high it’s imaginary. The one way that number becomes real is if keeps on with Meta. I don’t know at what point in Zuck’s psychology he cracks, but he will eventually when the money he has left becomes “real”. At that point he’ll drop META and get back to Facebook. As beaten up as this stock is, and even with the overall market down this much, FB would be up insane percentages in a quarter or two following this news. Do I think we have more push to the downside before we get there? Yes, of course but ultimately if I’m right in my thinking, that could be the drop that makes Zuckerberg pivot his stance, even if he still believes in Meta the reality of the economy and situation would force his hand. However, at some point after the big dump off we’re headed for, META is probably a good play in a 1-3 year span. If it goes on longer than that you risk no one caring about FB by that point and have moved on to another platform.",yya2hy,0,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yya2hy/is_meta_the_long_term_play_of_the_century/,1668742632.0,2022-11-17 22:37:12,1.0

7,7,7,7,7,7,7,UBS says The S&P 500 could plunge another 16% and won't bottom until the Fed starts to cut interest rates.," 

* The S&P 500 will fall to 3,200 points before it hits a low in Q2 next year, UBS has forecast.
* US stocks won't recover until the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, the bank said.
* ""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" UBS strategists said.

The S&P 500 US stock index could fall another 16%, before bottoming out in nine months' time once the Federal Reserve switches away from hiking interest rates, UBS has forecast.

The Swiss bank's strategists laid out this scenario in a Monday note: ""Weak growth and earnings drag the market lower before a fall in rates helps it bottom at 3,200 in Q2 '23 and lifts it to 3,900 by end '23.""

The S&P 500 would have to fall 15.9% from its Monday close at 3,806 to reach that low level.

The benchmark index has already slumped 20.1% year-to-date, weighed down by the Fed's tightening campaign, recession fears, and poor third-quarter earnings performances by Big Techs like Amazon and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.

UBS expects a slowdown in economic growth to carry on dragging stocks down until the second quarter. It also projected year-on-year global GDP will rise just 2.1% in 2023 — which would be the third-lowest expansion in the past three decades.

""Our forecast approaches something akin to a 'global recession',"" a UBS team led by chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note to clients.

""For the US, we now expect near zero growth in both 2023 and 2024, and a recession to start in 2023,"" they added.

That economic slump would likely lead to a period of disinflation, they said. Given the US central bank has increased interest rates rapidly to try to tame inflation running at 40-year highs, that would give policymakers scope to switch to cutting rates to stimulate economic growth.

""Combined with inflation falling rapidly, the Fed would cut the federal funds rate down to 1.25% by early 2024,"" the strategists said. The rate is currently at 3.75%.

""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" they added.

Expectations of a Fed pivot could lift the S&P 500 to 3,900 points — a 2.4% gain from its close Monday – by the end of 2023, according to UBS.

The bank also predicted that future rate cuts will lead to 10-year US Treasury yields slipping 155 basis points to 2.65% and the dollar slowly falling the ten most heavily-traded currencies as well as gold.

# Evaluation Methods

In this post, **three evaluation methods are used** to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

Note: all numbers are in thousands

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of -5.70%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE from 2019 to 2022 of -5.70%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2022 reported Free Cash Flow and its WACC based discounted rate of 9.62% and its Growth Rate of \[*scenatio 1; scenario 2; scenario 3*\]% to determine a fair value of:

1. $0.10
2. $0.37
3. $0.77

Note: the Scenario 2 and 3 is computed by using the assumption that the company will have positive free cash flow by end of 2023 as the managment planned, we assume a FCF of 10 milion

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated in the three scenarios.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.17|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of

1. $0.45
2. $4.19
3. $6.63

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|611,402,300|

This model gives us a price tag of:

1. \-$3.22
2. $1.12
3. $4.97

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

||Fair Value|
|:-|:-|
|**Scenario 1**|\-$0.89|
|**Scenario 2**|$1.89|
|**Scenario 3**|$4.12|
|**Average of the three scenarios**|**$1.70**|

* **The geography and location of Tilray Inc** provide it with a cost advantage in serving its customers, when compared to that with the competition.
* **Tilray Inc has a well-established IT system** that ensures efficiency in its internal and external operations.
* **Tilray Inc owns a number of intellectual property rights** that include trademarks and patents. These allow it exclusivity over its products and competitors cannot copy or reverse engineer them.
* **Tilray Inc is a brand that has been in the market for years**, and people are aware of it. This makes its brand awareness high.
* **Its products have maintained quality over the years** and are still valued by customers, who find it as good value for the amount of money that they pay.
* **Partnership**s: Strategic partnerships are established by Tilray Inc with its suppliers, dealers, retailers and other stakeholders. This allows it to leverage them if need be in the future.

## Weaknesses

* **Research and Development**: Even though Tilray Inc is spending more than the average research and development expenditure within the industry, it is spending way less than a few players within the industry that have had a significant advantage as a result of their innovative products.
* **High Day Sales Inventory**: The time it takes for products to be purchased and sold are higher than the industry average, meaning that Tilray Inc builds up on inventory adding unnecessary costs to the business.
* **Rented Property**: A significant proportion of the property that Tilray Inc owns is rented rather than purchased. It has to pay large amounts of rent on these adding to its costs.
* **Low current ratio**: The current ratio that shows the company’s ability to meet its short term financial obligations, is lower than the industry average. This could mean that the company could have liquidity problems in the future.
* **The company has low levels of current assets compared to current liabilities**, and this can create liquidity problems for it in operations.
* **Cash flow problems**: There is a lack of proper financial planning at Tilray Inc regarding cash flows, leading to certain circumstances where there isn’t enough cash flow as required leading to unnecessary unplanned borrowing.
* **Integration**: Tilray Inc's current structure and culture have resulted in the failure of various mergers aimed at vertical integration.
* **Market Research**: Tilray Inc has not conducted market research within the market that is serves since the past 2 years. As a result, it is making decisions based on years old data, while customer needs may have evolved over time.
* **High employee turnover rates**: Tilray Inc has a higher employee turnover rate compared to competitors. This means that it has more people leaving the job, and as a result, it is spending more on training and development as employees keep leaving and joining.
* **Quality Control**: Tilray Inc has a lower budget for its quality control department than competitors. This leads to lack of consistency and the possibility of damage to quality across its various outlets.
* **Lack of legal experience** and legal department employees are not highly qualified.
* **A few products have a high market share**, while most of the products have a low market share. This reliance on a few products makes Tilray Inc vulnerable to external threats if these few products suffer for any reason.
* **The workload is a high per worker** as there are fewer workers than the actual work required. This puts workers under psychological stress and is likely to be less productive.
* **Worker morale is low due to company culture** and politics that have grown in recent years.
* **Competition and qualified employees have been leaving** the organisation in recent years, which could mean a shortage of good talent for the company in the upcoming years.
* **The decision making is highly centralized**, and decisions by teams need to be approved by certain officials. This reduces efficiency in operations by making them more time consuming. It also leads to reduced innovation.
* **The performance appraisal is not in a systematic manner**. People are often not appraised for their performance. This leads to lower work morale and lack of promotion opportunities for employees.

## Opportunities

* **Internet**: there has been an increase in the number of internet users all over the world. This means that there is an opportunity for Tilray Inc to expand their presence online; by using the internet to interact with its customers.
* **E-commerce**: There has been a new trend and a growth in sales of the e-commerce industry. This means that a lot of people are now making purchases online. Tilray Inc can earn revenue by opening online stores and making sales through these.
* **Social Media**: there has been an increase in the number of social media users worldwide. The three social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, have shown the greatest number of increase in monthly active users. Tilray Inc can use social media to promote its products, interact with customers and collect feedback from them.
* **Technological developments**: technology comes with numerous benefits among many departments. Operations can be automated to reduce costs. Technology enables better data to be collected on customers and improves on marketing efforts.
* **Population**: the population has been growing and is expected to grow at a positive rate for the upcoming years. This is beneficial for Tilray Inc as there will be an increase in the number of potential customers that it can target.
* **Green government drive**: this provides an opportunity for Tilray Inc for the sale of Tilray Inc's products to federal and state government contractors.
* **Transport Industry**: the transport industry has been flourishing in the past few years, and shows growth potential in the future. This has reduced the costs of transportation, which is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will lower its overall costs.
* **Tax policy:** the governments’ reduction in tax rate is beneficial for Tilray Inc as a lower amount would be expensed out as a tax.
* **Tourism:** growth in tourism is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will provide new potential customers that it can target in order to gain market share.
* **Skilled workers:** increase in education and training by numerous institutes has increased the amount of skilled labor available within the country. This means that if Tilray Inc is able to hire skilled labor, it would have to spend less on training and development, therefore, saving costs.
* **A number of new niche markets have opened up that are growing**. Tilray Inc can sell products in these markets and take advantage.
* **Globalisation**: Increased globalisation does not restrict Tilray Inc to its own country. It can extend its operations to other countries, entering into these markets and making use of the opportunities that lie in these markets.
* **Consumers within the industry are becoming more conscious of health, and this is a segment that is growing**. Tilray Inc can take advantage by manufacturing products that are beneficial to customer's health.

* **Regulations have loosened in recent years** making it easier for businesses to carry out their operations.

## Treats

* **Suppliers:** The bargaining power of suppliers has increased over the years with the decrease in the number of suppliers. This means that the costs of inputs could increase for Tilray Inc.
* **New entrants:** there have been numerous players that have entered the market and are gaining market share by gaining existing companies’ market share. This is a threat to Tilray Inc as it can lose its customers to these new entrants.
* **Increasing competition**: there has been an increase in competition within the industry putting downward pressure on prices. This could lead to reduced revenue for Tilray Inc if it adjusts to the price changes, or loss of market share if it doesn’t.
* **Exchange Rate:** the exchange rate keeps fluctuating and this affects a company like Tilray Inc that has sales internationally, while its suppliers are local.
* **Political uncertainties** in the country prove to be a barrier in business, hindering performance at times and making the business incur unnecessary costs.
* **The fluctuating interest rates** in the country do not provide a stable financial and economic environment.
* **Consumer tastes are changing**, and this puts pressure on companies to constantly change their products to meet the needs of these customers.
* **Substitute products available are also increasing**, which is threat collectively for the whole industry as consumption of current products decrease.
* **The rise in prices of fuel** has increased in the input costs for Tilray Inc. These costs have also increased as other industries that provide inputs for this company also have suffered from increasing fuel prices, thereby charging more.
* **Increased promotions by competitors** have been a threat for Tilray Inc. On most media, there is more clutter than ever, and customers are bombarded with multiple messages. This reduces the effectiveness of promotional messages by Tilray Inc.
* **Constant technological developments require the workforce to be trained** accordingly as the inability to keep up with these changes can lead to loss of business for Tilray Inc.

# Final Considerations

**What is its future potential?**

Without Legalization, the company is destined to fail. It is burning its cash at a 2.09 rate, leaving it only 25 months of life expectancy (take in mind that this is an assumption cause obviously in those 25 months the company will have sales and other operations bringing in cash, the life expectancy is calculated on the assumption the company will not have further sales or other income of cash, so take this data as indicative).  If we assume a recover of macro data, consumption shall growth in other segments in which the company operates, cause marijuana is not its biggest nor main revenue stream. The company is well diversified of even without legalisation we shall expect to see it aroun in the next 5 years.

With Legalizaion, it is moon time baby. Its fundamentals, at the most conservative assumptions, prices it around 4$ but we all know that hype will push it further that price level bring it to be overvalued. Retailers and institution will surely try to cash in the hype so beware of speculative plays.

With the legalization scenarios, we can expect two outcomes:

1. The Management do not manage to contain costs and improve efficiency, making it growth slow
2. The Management manages to cut cost and boost efficiency, making Tilray grow

There is potential, but risk is very high

**What are the risks?**

Observing statistical data about Tilray's price movements, we can except a 7.72% risk rate. The Stock's return distribution is concentrated around negative numbers. If you want to invest for long time expect a miminum retuern rate of 0.12% and a 44% chancge of getting a daily price movement between -4% and 0%

**Is the company a Buy or a Sell?**

This is hard. It all depend on legalization in the USA, and if it happens, it depends on when it happens. If legalization comes in 5 years, welp, this company is going tits up, but if it come next week, well, you know the drill.

Personally this stock is a Gamble, cause its fate is determined heavily by politics.

Are you a Gamblerer?

There may be other factors involved. In any case, they see that it can't go any further and there is no other option for growth in sight, so they  go All In in to the Metaverse. It is questionable if the Metaverse by Meta will have prevailed in 5 - 10 years in view of so many other hardware and software solutions. Yesterday I was at an event sponsored by HTC VR and there, among others, Autodesk (professional software giant) presented their new collaboration with Epic Games (Unreal Engine, Fortnite).

17,17,17,17,17,17,17,"Apple is now valued more than Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined"," 

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions. For our Branding division, we plan to manufacture products on the island to be sold on the island and export products back to the United States. For Cannabis, we plan to acquire the real estate and equipment needed to operate a manufacturing operation. We will not be involved in the day-to-day operations, but plan to receive a monthly fee for the building and use of the equipment equal to 25% of the monthly revenue.

The Company, in compliance with SEC regulations, will use social media outlets like Facebook or Twitter and its own website at [www.igpk.org](http://www.igpk.org/) to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD.

  This CHUNKY boy is only going to get chunkier as the boomers get older and older.  Life expectancy is going UP (post-covid) and boomers will become 80 then 90 then 100.  Facebook is going NOWHERE.  All the hipsters say ""Oh I'm going to quit social media,"" but look at how many of your friends actually delete their accounts.  Zuck's got his claws in all of us.

While you think FB is all boomers now, it's only going to increase over the next decade.

Seniors today spend their retirement watching FOX News, and Zuck knows the seniors of tomorrow will sit on FB 12 hour/day DEEP into retirement.

Who's META for?  Not you.  It's for BOOMERS who just had their 2nd knee surgery and can't go to the Louvre in person.  They don't care about gaming, they don't care about graphics.  Zuck is going to mop up all those sweet sweet social security and pension dollars come 2030 and 2040.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me.

:Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop.

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms.

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized

2)Whatsapp & Messenger monetization

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery & or more spending for ads again.

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following & can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1. U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets.
2. A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back.

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most.

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up.

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 19 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead.

Meta has a family of 3 billion users and growing. Starlink from Elon is  helping third world countries get internet and those are new people to  social media. I have a friend a brazilian actress that visited an amazon  tribe and they are using FB and Instagram and especially whatsapp now  on smart phones. Seriously! Billions of more users open up to social  media as Starlink progresses. People only think in their own bubble and  forget there are billions of people that love metas products.

UPDATE: Meta laying off workforce for the first time is bullish IMO. Good move.

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

Hope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.

27,27,27,27,27,27,27,Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club. Sell-off pushes market cap below $1 trillion for first time since April 2020," 

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

35,35,35,35,35,35,35,What the boomer idiot investors don't realize about METAverse,"I see some real shit opinions all over Reddit on META, as this place has somehow become a cynical cesspool of anti-intellectual teenagers that think they know better. 

Listen to me instead. An elder millennial that gets triggered by misinformation all day long and also thinks I know better. (sometimes it's even true) Also, may or may not be regarded. You tell me. 

Here's what I see:

\>""it looks worse than roblox / vr chat"" 

\>""Facebook is dying""

\>""bring back myspace""

First of all, shut the fuck up. Just stop. Please. It hurts my head. If it was true, that would be fine. But like I said I my autism gets triggered by dumbness. 

WHY has Facebook/META thrown nearly 100 billion at this? (with a revenue of 27 billion per quarter, they have the money)

Facebook is the ONLY multi-modal social media company in the USA. It has a marketplace, local community groups, videos (50% of all facebook traffic is watching videos) not to mention Insta, whatsapp. You can do almost anything on it. Run a business. Chat with your mom. See what your friends are doing. Rent a boat. Harass women with pics of your extremely small penis. Whatever you want! (don't do the last one bro. Just don't.)

So WHY? 

It's a hardware platform, that you cannot access on a normal PC. Only on a META VR headset (potentially) 

You think the graphics look bad? That's like blaming youtube for 480p video. Don't blame youtube. Blame the creator for having a shitty camera. Metaverse is the platform. Not the video. It's a new platform that has tools to do whatever you want. AR or VR both in one.

Now just imagine this, if you can. Tell your wife to hop off her boyfriend's dick, pull both of them over, and try to imagine with me. 

Your favorite youtube/twitch livestreamer? Don't watch them anymore. VR with them. Walk in their room as they talk to you. Sit at their desk. You're not behind a screen anymore. You're in the room. Even a prerecorded youtube video can work this way. Or do it live.

You want to see that Ye redemption concert tour but the tickets are $5,000? Attend in VR. Walk around, live. The performer doesn't need a headset. Just you. Interact with other VR people at the concert (or not). See their facial expressions. Dance with them. Switch your headset over to AR, go to the fridge, get a drink, check your texts, reply to an email, and then head back into the concert. All using the headset. Buy merch at the shop, which has an AR eshop overlay. Easy. This can be done with 3d camera arrays. Even a basic iphone can LIDAR scan a bedroom in 5 minutes. Apple ahead of the game as always. A highly accurate (to the 1/16"" accuracy) venue model can be recreated in a single day using current technology, like the Leica BLK360 scanner. That's your metaverse. It's whatever you want. 

You can't attend your best friends wedding? Attend in VR metaverse platform. The normal attendees will just see you on a screen (or not at all), they don't need headsets. But you can walk around, see the moment, while not being too invasive. To them, you're just on an ipad somewhere. Maybe there's a few 360 cameras around. Some LIDAR scanners to record the venue (or the venue provides this). You're not intrusive, but you can experience it. 

Want to buy a puppy on FB marketplace? See it in VR. Live. Confirm it's not a scam. Send the money through Facebook even, with buyer protection.

Onlyfans - see your favorite porn model from every angle. Walk around. Jack off in the privacy of your home. Squirt some e-jizz all over his/her face. or not. I'm not the boss of you.

The possibilities here are endless. This hasn't even mentioned the work from home benefits yet. This is still 5-10 years down the road. But it is coming. Reality and the digital world WILL mix together more and more over time. Unless the apocalypse gets us first ofc. And META has a huge head start in technology hardware and software tools (not software environment))

So. That's why you're all dumb for comparing it to VR chat. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

After talking about AI the entire presentation the second to last question was ""are you going to invest in AI"". Fuck do these guys not get it.

I don't own the stock, but had to correct a few things. I might buy mid-dated calls. 

&#x200B;

Point 1: Metaverse is still minor investment

Meta is in the name, but that was to include the family of apps as equals - you don't think Alphabet is only going to teach kids the letters on Mr. Rogers. Get it together - 80% of cash is spent on the core business.

The core business is displaying ads. The $30B capex investment is for just that purpose - showing higher converting ads.

&#x200B;

Point 2: Meta doesn't want to be cool

Meta is built for people who shop at Walmart and your grandma. The same way we waste our time on this site, every demographic has a platform, and the vast majority of those demographics use a Family of Apps product.

TikTok, Youtube, Twitter (with Elon) are going to be cooler. However, facebook/insta are replacing shit, not your trip to an underground Wes Anderson inspired photo exhibit in LA.

&#x200B;

Point 3: Headsets aren't for your porn

Don't trade this stock thinking about how you'd use the headsets today. Today they are just for novelty gaming. Like early PCs, a few specific business use cases and a couple trivial games for nerds. Most tech starts with nerds and then in 5 year, or \*more\*, when your goth gf has a lifelike avatar in the metaverse you'll buy a headset to see her when your wife is away.

Investors in Meta stock wanted to hear one thing on the embattled company's earnings call late Wednesday: an acknowledgement by founder Mark Zuckerberg that leaner spending times were ahead as margins have been squeezed by an ill-timed metaverse build out and a slowing ad market.

They heard the opposite.

The social media platform outlined about 13% year-over-year expense growth for fiscal year 2023, well above the Street's forecast of 7%. Meta will clearly continue to spend aggressively — despite the prospects of a 2023 U.S. recession — on Instagram, the metaverse, and VR hardware.

""With a new CFO in place, some may argue the company is being overly conservative,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black wrote in a note to clients, ""and while Meta typically lowers \[operating expenditure\] guidance throughout the year (as they did so far year to date), the elevated expense outlook is the wrong number at the wrong time for investors. Perhaps just as importantly, growing Reality Labs (RL) expenses appear to be one source of the elevated expense guide as RL operating losses are expected to grow significantly year over year in 2023.""

Meta shares crashed more than 20% in pre-market trading on Thursday. The ticker was atop the ""[Top Trending](https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers)"" section on the Yahoo Finance platform.

* The stock plunged in extended trading after already losing two-thirds of its value so far this year,

Facebook parent Meta reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

**Earnings per share (EPS): $1.64 vs $1.89 expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Revenue: $27.71 billion vs. $27.38 billion expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Daily Active Users (DAUs): 1.98 billion vs 1.98 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Monthly Active Users (MAUs): 2.96 billion vs 2.94 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Average Revenue per User (ARPU): $9.41 vs. $9.83 expected, according to StreetAccount**

Facebook’s parent is contending with a broad slowdown in online ad spending, challenges from Apple’s

 iOS privacy update and increased competition from TikTok. Add it up, and Meta is expected to post its third straight quarter of declining sales for the year.

The company said revenue for the fourth quarter will be $30 billion to $32.5 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $32.2 billion.

Meta’s revenue declined 4% year over year to $27.7 billion in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the company’s costs and expenses rose 19% year over year to $22.1 billion. Operating income declined 46% from the previous year to $5.66 billion.

The Facebook parent’s operating margin, or the profits left after accounting for costs to run the business, sank to 20% from 36% a year earlier.

Revenue in the Reality Labs unit, which houses the company’s virtual reality headsets and its futuristic metaverse business, fell by almost half from a year earlier to $285 million. Its loss widened to $3.67 billion from $2.63 in the same quarter last year.

Reality Labs has lost $9.4 billion so far this year.

Meta said that it is “holding some teams flat in terms of headcount, shrinking others and investing headcount growth only in our highest priorities.”

“As a result, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 will be approximately in-line with third quarter 2022 levels,” the company added in a statement.

* The former Facebook executive and CEO of Social Capital has helped several companies go public via SPAC, including Virgin Galactic.
* Still, Palihapitiya pushed back on the idea that SPACs were hit harder than other assets.

Billionaire investor and so-called SPAC King Chamath Palihapitiya said the zero interest rates the Federal Reserve allowed to persist for years created the “perverted” market conditions he benefited from at the height of the pandemic.

Speaking with Axios’ Dan Primack at an event on Wednesday, Palihapitiya explained what he felt contributed to the rapid rise and collapse of the SPAC market, the shorthand for special purpose acquisition companies, which created a way for young companies to go public without some of the usual IPO hurdles. SPACs, which grew in popularity in the first two years of the pandemic, have seen a reset amid economic and regulatory headwinds. Still, there are more than 450 deals on the market for a merger target ahead of 2023 deadlines, according to SPAC Research.

The former Facebook executive and CEO of Social Capital has helped several companies go public via SPAC, including Virgin Galactic

, from which he later sold his personal stake before stepping down from the board. Earlier this month he closed two SPACs after failing to find merger targets in time.

“We are learning what went wrong, which is that we had a decade-plus of zero interest rates,” Palihapitiya said of the market. “That is what fundamentally was wrong. It perverted the market. It distorted reality. It allowed manias and asset bubbles to build in every single part of the economy.”

Low interest rates mean lower returns on savings accounts, which can encourage more spending in the economy, which can be a boon for high-growth assets.

Palihapitiya said the “free money” given by the central bank resulted in a “misallocation of risk,” which led many people to misprice the risk of their investments.

55,55,55,55,55,55,55,Analysts (down 28%): Snap shares plunge again - 3 major problems still lurking," 

* \+1.29%

The disappearing stock price for Snap continues after another challenging quarter.

Shares of the social media platform crashed 25% in pre-market trading on Friday as third quarter sales marked the fifth straight quarterly deceleration. Profits were also lackluster as Snap continued to blame an advertising slowdown and Apple privacy changes for the execution missteps.

Here's a snapshot of Snap's dismal numbers:

* **Net Sales:** $1.13 billion vs. $1.14 billion estimate
* **Daily Active Users:** 363 million vs. 358 million estimate
* **Average Revenue Per User:** $3.11 vs. $3.17 estimate
* **Adjusted EPS:** $0.08 vs. estimated loss of $0.02
* **Guidance:** ""Flat"" revenue growth seen in the fourth quarter

The company warned sales trends in the fourth quarter would get worse.

Snap shares were tops on the Yahoo Finance '[Trending Ticker](https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers)' page through early morning.

EvercoreISI analyst [Mark Mahaney](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-is-a-broken-growth-story-top-tech-analyst-174325345.html) said Snap's Q3 results negatively surprised them. ""We had assumed that the August improvement Snap disclosed in early September would hold for the quarter. Instead, Snap's revenue trends were a very volatile 0% year over year in July, mid-teens % growth year over year in August, and low single-digit % growth year over year in September…even with comps easing from the Platform Policy Changes, which began in early Q3:21,"" he said.

""And we think it likely that the recent major personnel changes at SNAP – the loss of key ad execs to Netflix – has exacerbated the headwinds,"" Mahaney added.

 Analyst spotlight

Jefferies analyst [Brent Thill](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/facebook-move-metaverse-optical-illusion-143959906.html) sees three problems with the stock. He's sticking with a Buy rating on Snap in the wake of the disastrous third quarter. But the long-time tech analyst sees three problems ahead that may still not be priced into Snap's deeply discounted stock price:

* *""Q4 rev guidance implies significant growth deceleration. While Snap has seen its revenue growth accelerate to +9% year over year quarter to date, management is still only forecasting flat year over year growth for Q4. Weakness in brand advertising appears to be the main source of the steep deceleration, but we think there could also be conservatism embedded. In our view, Q1'23 may be the bottom for revenue growth, with gradual acceleration through 2023 on easing comparisons.*
* *It's difficult to parse out how many of Snap's issues are transitory. The weakening macro backdrop is partially to blame for soft results, but we question how much is due to the iOS privacy issues and competitive threats. We view the competitive threats as most concerning given the potential long-term implications for the platform.*
* *20% headcount reductions and executive departures could cause further disruptions. We worry that Snap's reorganization could lead advertisers to slow or even pause their spending. Given Snap had been growing headcount over 30% year over year for 4 straight quarters, we wonder if the company can execute on its lofty growth objectives with a 20% smaller employee base.""*

59,59,59,59,59,59,59,Admitting a mistake doesn't mean the stock will go up: Mark Zuckerberg says he missed a huge shift in the social network,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg failed to anticipate a newer trend in social networking that contributed to the success of rival TikTok.

&#x200B;

In an interview published Wednesday in analyst Ben Thompson’s Statechery newsletter, the Facebook founder said he “sort of missed” a newer way that people “interact with discovered content” via social networking services. People are increasingly using their social networking “feeds” to discover compelling content as opposed to viewing the media shared by the friends that they follow, he explained.

&#x200B;

Although people still interact with content that their friends share in their feeds, the overall social networking trend has “by and large shifted to you use your feed to discover content, you find things that are interesting, you send them to your friends in messages and you interact there,” Zuckerberg said.

&#x200B;

“So in that world, it is actually somewhat less important who produces the content that you’re finding, you just want the best content,” the Facebook founder said. (Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta last year.)

&#x200B;

Analysts have attributed TikTok’s rapid rise in popularity to its algorithm, which can recommend compelling short videos to users based on their habits and viewing history. TikTok’s rise has posed a significant challenge to the company, which is experiencing a decline in North American Facebook users, and a stock price that’s lost more than 56% this year so far.

&#x200B;

Zuckerberg referred to TikTok as a “very effective competitor” during the interview and acknowledged that the company was ″somewhat slow to this because it didn’t fit my pattern of a social thing, it felt more like a shorter version of YouTube to me,” he said.",y3uc7v,11,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y3uc7v/admitting_a_mistake_doesnt_mean_the_stock_will_go/,1665754993.0,2022-10-14 09:43:13,0.0

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in [a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653?mod=article_inline)from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN).com Inc., [Meta Platforms](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META) Inc.’s Facebook, [Alphabet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG) Inc.’s Google, [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) Corp. and [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) Corp.

Given the company’s future prospects, future profitability estimates, and the current price of risk, I estimated the intrinsic value of Facebook at $420b or $156 per share, with a 1-year price target at $171 per share, implying a 23% upside.

## The Metaverse is Coming, Later

Meta made a possibly rushed bet on the metaverse while getting slightly carried away in its peer campaign to offset public and regular attention from their business practices.

Staking the company on a big promise such as the metaverse isn’t a bad tactic to “get it done”, but it will likely require more time and effort than anyone has initially estimated. This strategy is in contrast to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL)’s approach where they have a diverse product portfolio, but end up discontinuing projects as no key executive has the steel to stake their reputation on them.

### Reinvesting Into the Business

Meta estimated a CapEx spend of [around $32b](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Meta-06.30.2022-Exhibit-99.1-Final.pdf) in 2022, but seems to be quietly trimming spending on headcount and likely internally freezing projects. In the future, I expect Meta to lower the focus on the metaverse project, and move to improving key advertising features of its platform (\*cough\* that buggy mess), providing new content creation features, and incentives for people and professionals to create content.

### More or Better Content

As a maturing tech business, I believe that the company will have to reinvest more into existing features to make them fun (not engaging), and profitable for people.

Regarding content creation, I imagine the business will engage in something like the following projects:

* Hybrid-AI programs - content created by [AI](https://beta.openai.com/), but enriched by a content creator.
* AI program - short AI created content snips.
* Engaging in contractor services - reinvesting in strategic content creation, such as high search volume content, content for groups and assistance, etc.

## Valuation

I expect a slowdown of revenue growth in the coming year with a growth of 2% in 2023 and 7% in the 4 years thereafter, with a decay function converging to the riskfree rate at year 10.

As a maturing company, I expect Meta to start slightly declining in profitability and allocating more resources to improving the quality of existing features, this may result in a future adjusted EBIT margin of 28% down from the adj. EBIT margin of 47.5% in the last 12 months. I adjust EBIT by capitalizing R&D, as this is a key investment for a tech company like Meta. The cost of capital used at the start of the valuation is 9.75%.

[Finally, here is the resulting model for Meta:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660)

Here is the table if you want to dig into the details:

[NASDAQ:META Valuation Table, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/i88xxjzh5ds91.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=1119f6a004da3815047985cd408a50297b4b489b)

You can use this general model to fine-tune your view of the company’s future, as well as an explainer of why the market price has dropped for Facebook.

### Risks

Meta’s key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. YouTube may become more engaging with its “shorts” feature, and the platform is set up to produce more costly content via its revenue sharing program with creators. This is opposed to Meta, which produces “cheaper” content that can only be monetized by advertisers and influencers, while people have little incentive to be creative on the platform. This may slowly shift the platform to a low-value content aggregator. *Think about it, which of your favorite figures are on Meta, and how many are there exclusively?*

Meta’s decision-making hierarchy seems to be structured top-down. While this allows for efficient execution of projects, the trade-off is that the administration is deaf to consumer feedback.

The metaverse project may be a large cash drain for investors, and nobody has the power to say “no” to the voting rights of the CEO. The best investors can do is leave - like Peter Theil, and that is a weak feedback mechanism which is starting to show its downside.

## Conclusion

The market seems to be pricing the company at or even slightly below intrinsic value.

Meta will have a rough period ahead, but can create additional value if it balances the business between focusing on internal quality and returning capital to investors.

**Drop a TICKER in the comments, and I'll send you a spreadsheet you can tinker with.**

Within the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660), there are a few things that can help you in your analysis:

* Check out the competitor dashboard, that tells you where Meta ranks amongst key peers. You can also find your next research candidates there. I would move to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL) next, as a higher quality stock.
* If you are thinking of Meta in terms of trading, try the market sentiment analysis. This can help you better assess the short-term market disposition towards the stock.
* Intrinsic analysis isn’t always the best option, so try comparing it with the multiple analysis in the sheet. Pay attention to the implied EV/Sales ratio, which is based on a regression model that tries to find out if the market is underpricing the stock. It has its flaws, but it may help.
* Take a look at the decision tree at the bottom. It runs a few checks to see which strategies are appropriate for the stock.",xxvy03,125,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xxvy03/not_great_not_terrible_why_i_valued_meta_at_420/,1665140042.0,2022-10-07 06:54:02,1.0

1)  First of all, it most likely will no longer be a publicly traded company and will become a private company. This will be a major change for the social media giant as private status reduces regulation requirements, increases flexibility, limits liability and allows for faster decisions-making, etc.

2)  I wouldn’t be surprised if the name Twitter changed similar to what Facebook did.

3)  Musk might allow controversial individuals to return or he might kick more people off the site, only time will tell.

4)  Musk could even shut it down for an extended period of time as he revamps its’ path forward.

Below is my rationale behind these companies and my decision to purchase their stocks exclusively and heavily these next 15 months, please let me know your thoughts!

-Diversification from USD. These companies are renown worldwide and bring in 65% of their revenue, give or take, from other currencies - a possible windfall in the future.

-Google has 125 billion dollars in cash. This is about 10% of their market capitalization & they’re planning on conducting substantial share buybacks now and next year, and possibly buying Pinterest.

-If you type in ‘how sheryl sandberg changed the digital advertising business’ on google images you will see a graph that shows the global ad spend by mediums and companies, it is astonishing. Meta and Google are also known to be extremely profitable companies.

-Looking at 2021 free cash flow of Meta - 39.3b, and their market cap presently - 372.5b, they produce approximately 10.6% of their market cap in free cash flow. Say in 5-10 years, buying the shares at this valuation, and if the metaverse is a complete dud and they abandon associated capital expenditures, I reckon they will be able to afford a 15% dividend from today’s value.

-The digital advertising market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 17.6% from 2021-2026.

-Their valuations are extremely appealing.

-They are not associated with China, so potential future conflicts will be less impactful.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced the social networking company’s freeze during a weekly Q&A session with employees, according to a person in attendance. He added that the company would reduce budgets across most teams, even teams that are growing, and that individual teams will sort out how to handle headcount changes—whether that means not filling roles that employees depart, shifting people to other teams, or working to “manage out people who aren’t succeeding,” according to remarks reviewed by Bloomberg.

“I had hoped the economy would have more clearly stabilized by now, but from what we’re seeing it doesn’t yet seem like it has, so we want to plan somewhat conservatively,” Zuckerberg said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta’s further cost cuts and hiring freeze are its starkest admission that advertising revenue growth is slowing, amid mounting competition for users’ attention. Meta said earlier this year that it was planning to slow hiring for some management roles, and had postponed handing out full-time jobs to summer interns. The freeze was necessary because “we want to make sure we’re not adding people to teams where we don’t expect to have roles next year,” Zuckerberg explained.

Zuckerberg had warned in July that that Meta would “steadily reduce headcount growth,” and that “many teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas.” Priorities internally include Reels, Meta’s TikTok competitor, and Zuckerberg’s futuristic plan for the internet, known as the metaverse. Meta had more than 83,500 employees as of June 30, and added 5,700 new hires in the second quarter. Zuckerberg said the company would be “somewhat smaller” by the end of 2023.

“For the first 18 years of the company, we basically grew quickly basically every year, and then more recently our revenue has been flat to slightly down for the first time,” he told staff Thursday.

During its first-quarter earnings call, the company said annual expenses would be roughly $3 billion lower than initially projected, trimming an estimated range that had been as high as $95 billion. In prior moves to reduce spending, a dual-camera watch the company was building to compete with the Apple Watch was shuttered.

The cloud services business is known for hosting Truth Social and the Rumble video platform.

# News cycle catalysts for current price movement:

Rumble officially De-Spaced today and is now listed as $RUM

# Content Creators Taking Notice:

Russell Brand with 5.9 million followers has signed a deal for an exclusive live show on the platform.

Glen Greenwald the founder of The Intercept and a Pulitzer-Prize-winning investigative journalist who leaked the Snowden files is also starting an exclusive live TV news show.

Andrew Tate has moved his 4.5 million followers to his Hustler's University – after recently being removed from Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter for misogynistic remarks.

## List of some other notable content creators recently added:

Tulsi Gabbard, Bridget Phetasy, Matt Orfalea, Siraj Hashmi & Mujahed Kobbe, Shant Mesrobian & Zaid Jilani

Joe Rogan who hosts the most successful podcast in the world has taken notice [https://twitter.com/rumblevideo/status/1569295378910167040?s=20&t=L0yUuCVsBYNVqATk2gdkOQ](https://twitter.com/rumblevideo/status/1569295378910167040?s=20&t=L0yUuCVsBYNVqATk2gdkOQ)

Impressive Growth Story:

On par with Twitter in million monthly active users last reported @ 69 million and that company is presently valued at around $44bn, in comparison Rumble is currently deeply discounted at a value of only $2bn-$3bn.

## Growth Story:

(**Excerpt from CEO on SEC filing**) Before this explosion of growth, we were doing roughly 1, 1.5 million monthly active users. In our first major leg of growth, we posted 21 million monthly active users in Q4 of 2020. By the summer, of Q3 of 2021, Rumble hit another leg of growth, hitting an average of 36 million monthly active users on the platform.

Rumble saw another massive leg of growth happen, averaging an average of 44 million monthly active users in Q2 of 2022. Then that takes us to now, and what we’ve seen now is probably one of the most exciting times that I’ve ever seen in running this business. We are now transcending politics. This has nothing to do with politics anymore. We hit 78 million monthly active users globally in August of 2022, with 63 million alone in just US and Canada.

# What makes them different:

Censorship has become a major problem on the YouTube platform for content providers and they are starting to take notice. I believe it’s about to reach a tipping point on its way to juggernaut status. Mainstream media and tech companies continue to ignore alternate viewpoints or actively try to suppress information.

Information suppression is likely to get worse after the midterm elections go badly for the democrats, with platforms likely to double down on their idea censorship. Rumble is a bootstrapped company whose main tenet is to resist censorship which will eventually cause a shift in the most popular names to move platforms to regain their freedom.

## Notable Investors:

May 19, 2021 - Peter Thiel and venture capital firm, Narya Capital, which was co-founded by author J.D. Vance. Narya’s Ethan Fallang will be joining Rumble’s board of directors.

Peter Thiel isn’t in the habit of losing money!

David Sacks - another member of the famed Paypal mafia was recently complaining that an episode of his popular podcast had been removed from YouTube without explanation.

&#x200B;

## Nimble and actively recruiting

After Truth Social went live in February with a rocky start users couldn’t sign up because of glitches Rumble stepped in and migrated the platform to its cloud infrastructure in April.

It's planning on offering its cloud web hosting service with guarantees to uphold freedom of speech and plans to make it available to all users in 2023. [According to Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/), the $178 billion cloud services market, which grew by 37% in 2021, is dominated by the tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Google who all have questionable records on censorship.

The company is also quick to react to calls for content creators' cancelations one recent example is Joe Rogan’s who the media called to cancel before any decisions were made Rumble quickly stepped in with a $100 million contract offer.

# Conclusion

Take this lesson from the past as to why you should support free speech platforms even if you are not currently in need or personally affected:

*First, they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.*

*Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.*

*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.*

*Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.*

*- Martin Niemoller Lutheran pastor Imprisoned by the Gestapo for “treasonable statements”*

It's not like Google and Facebook. It's not like Apple and Amazon. We can debate Apple or Amazon, what's better? They both look like tech monopolies to me. They both look pretty good.

It's stupid. It's not 60% dominant. It's like 96 or 95% dominant, right?

Take all your money, buy Tesla. Then take all your time, figure out how to borrow more money to buy more Tesla. Then take all your time, figure out what you can sell to buy Tesla. And if you absolutely love the thing and you don't want to sell it, go mortgage your house and buy Tesla with it.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been oft-critical of social media companies, said he wants to regulate and maybe license the companies, including big names like Meta’s Facebook or Twitter, Reuters wrote.

Graham said he’s working on a measure with Sens. Elizabeth Warren  and Josh Hawley. 

Graham, speaking at a hearing to discuss security lapses at Twitter, said companies had been able to become “internationally powerful” without much restrictions on what they were allowed to do.

He also said he had concerns that there were few tools the Federal Trade Commission could use to rein them in — he said they’re not licensed and “you can’t sue them.” He added that “if you drive a car, you need a license, if you sell real estate, you need a license.”

The plan he has might involve regulations with limits on what speech the companies could take down and regulating them to be tougher about criminal use of the networks and foreign interference.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have critiqued the big tech companies, with some of the concerns being antitrust and the lack of oversight.

Criticism of big tech is nothing new and isn’t restricted to Congress. Recently, more than a dozen tech companies offering alternatives to the big tech firms have come out in favor of more regulation against the big tech companies.

“Massive tech platforms can exert influence over society and the digital economy because they ultimately have the power to collect, analyze, and monetize exorbitant amounts of personal information,” the companies, and others, wrote in a letter to Congress together. “This is not by accident, as some of the tech giants have intentionally abused their gatekeeper positions to lock users into perpetual surveillance while simultaneously making it difficult to switch to privacy-protective alternatives.”

87,87,87,87,87,87,87,"Mark Zuckerberg is ‘continuing to derail’ Facebook, says Harvard expert: ‘He’s really lost his way’","Mark Zuckerberg’s poor leadership skills are slowly dragging Meta toward failure, a Harvard expert says.

Zuckerberg’s shortcomings as CEO are “continuing to derail” the tech giant formerly known as Facebook, according to Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former CEO of medical technology company Medtronic.

“I think Facebook is not going to do well as long as he’s there,” George tells CNBC Make It. “He’s likely one of the reasons so many people are turning away from the company. He’s really lost his way.”

George has spent the past 20 years studying leadership failures in the workplace, recently compiling those findings into a new book called, “True North: Leading Authentically in Today’s Workplace, Emerging Leader Edition.”

In short, George says bosses that lose sight of their most deeply held beliefs, values and purpose as a leader — especially in the name of money, fame or power — are doomed to fail. And after decades of researching high-profile corporate collapses, he says he sees striking similarities to Zuckerberg and Meta today.

Zuckerberg and Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It’s request for comment. The Meta CEO is largely responsible for his company’s meteoric growth to this point, transforming the company he co-founded in 2004 into a tech giant with a $450.46 billion market cap, as of Monday morning.

In doing so, he helped create the modern-day social media industry — a move he’s attempting to replicate now by repositioning his company into the metaverse space. Given his past success, it might be unwise to bet against him, as CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on “Squawk Box” in February.

“I know that this is probably out of fashion, I have total faith in Mark Zuckerberg. I think Zuckerberg’s going to be able to pull off ... the metaverse,” Cramer said, adding that Meta has a track record of rebounding after stock dips, scandal and controversy. “There’s some people you have to bet on. And if you go back to 2018 to that horrible summer breakdown ... no one thought these guys could come back.”

Still, George says Meta is bound to fail as long as Zuckerberg remains at the helm. Here’s why:

What makes this better then any old boring SPAC merging with a company you've never heard of?

.. lets start with post-merger conditions.. 95% of share dilution will be under a 1 year lockup. (insiders/and PIPE). There's price target incentives at $15 and $17.50 (after the shares are paid out, the marketcap will have roughly a 1B bump up).. 

From 2.4B marketcap at merger (@ $10 per share), to 3.6B with the added ""bonus"" shares.

The bonus shares for each price target need to hold for 20 days within a 30 day window (straight), to be paid out.

Rumble is experiencing MASSIVE month-month / yearly growth. (currently 78M monthly average users for the month of August)

As more and more creators look for safe haven from being YouTube banned (because of politics/science/etc), they take shelter at Rumble, the ONLY free-speech platform, that is professional and lets you speak openly (within the boundaries of the law). 

Andrew Tate was recently banned off essentially ALL media platforms, (they all banded together and cancelled him), so he joined Rumble, and expressed why Rumble is important, and that everyone needs a company like Rumble to fight against Big-tech, so people can have their own opinions without being cancelled. He has asked everyone to rally together and Join Rumble, and create accounts there.

This has opened up the doors to entirely new demographic of user starting to join, and now with hints of Stevewilldoit/Nelk/Fullsend Being next up to join, due to cancellation.

More and more creators will start cross-posting their YouTube channels to Rumble, as just another source of revenue, whether they're cancelled or not. This will in turn spike the Monthly average users and ad revenue through the roof, and open the doors to more channels being cross-posted.

The company has a host of investors behind it, the most notable is Peter Thiel. This is his first media investment since Facebook. 

Rumble will be entering the cloud service space in the next year or so, they're already expanding what they currently have. (Truth Social from TMTG) is currently running on their cloud service infrastructure, and in the next year or so Rumble will open the doors to be commercially available. They also have a payment processor that is free of big-tech, and are in talks of a web browser.

They are advertising as being the ONLY free-speech, anti-censorship media platform AND hosting infrastructure on the markets. which IMO will be MASSIVE. These niche companies will always be a standout, especially if they have non-stop rolling catalysts from big youtube creators joining the platform in the process.

Rumble is a real pillar in the free-speech sector. They're even suing Google currently for 2B+ in damages, for google routing search results to YouTube, rather then other (smaller) video platforms like Rumble. You can search for a Rumble video SPECIFICALLY on google and it will bring up a YouTube video. Which is illegally favoring their own businesses. Rumble has now entered a stage in the lawsuit where Google will have to provide how their algorithms work when searching for things, to ensure they aren't favoring their own businesses (which they clearly are).. This could be a MASSIVE discovery.

Rumble plans on taking Marketshare from:

YouTube/google, AWS, Azure, and they're releasing tiktok format videos. 

With Trump, Andrew Tate, and a host of other notable creators likely to join, all backed by a free-speech driven CEO, this just screams ""meme"" status, but with real sentimental value.

If you think that monopolies are relics of the past, [this report](https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers) released by Open Markets Institute is a must-read. Here are some stunning excerpts:

* Since 1993, consolidation has reduced the number of large defense firms from 107 to five.
* Amazon sells 74 percent of all e-books sold online, and it sells 64 percent of all print books sold online.
* CVS and Walgreens control 89% of the drug store business.
* Google controls [64 percent](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings/comScore-Releases-February-2016-US-Desktop-Search-Engine-Rankings) of all desktop searches and [94 percent](https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&qpsp=2016&qpnp=1&qptimeframe=Y&qpcustomd=1) of all global and mobile tablet searches.
* Two companies, Mars and Hershey, control 75% of the candy market in America.

Big Tech companies are the most well-known offenders with a few companies controlling almost everything we do online.

While it’s Big Tech that captures all the headlines, almost all the industries are now dominated by a few companies. Look around your store the next time you go grocery shopping - you might think that as a consumer you have a plethora of choices. But in reality,

https://preview.redd.it/92tsiukag1m91.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=aac3a72e7f926223c47fd47cb1c4826efd2109ab

There are arguments [for and against](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/economics-101-what-is-a-monopoly) a few companies controlling the majority of market share that are beyond the scope of this article. *The question which I’m interested in as an investor is* whether these companies tend to outperform the market and provide stable returns while doing so.

After all, Warren Buffett’s favorite types of business are the ones that have huge economic moats which are near-monopolies in the industries they operate in. Once, [asked at an annual meeting](https://www.barrons.com/articles/myth-of-capitalism-book-excerpt-51544500404) what his ideal business was, Buffett argued that it was one that had “high pricing power, a monopoly.” The message is clear according to Buffett: If you’re investing in a business with competition, you’re doing it wrong.

### Monopoly Returns

Anyone who has played the Monopoly board game knows the unbridled joy of collecting rent for the properties you own and driving your competitors to bankruptcy. I wanted to see if the same process is reflected in real life where companies having a monopoly in certain sectors could drive out competitors, rise prices, and give an outsized return on investment.

If you try to do a backtest on the biggest monopolies of today, you would quickly run into hindsight bias. The companies that are monopolies now might or might not have been monopolies a decade back. For example, there was no way of knowing Google would dominate the in-app ecosystem in Phones, and that Amazon would be the king of cloud services back in 2010.

To overcome this, I went back in time *(using this* [*nifty little feature from Google*](https://mashable.com/article/google-search-by-date)*)* and searched for publications covering monopoly investments. I found two relevant articles that we can use for the analysis.

1. **The next 7 American Monopolies** \- [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-next-7-american-monopolies-2010-11?IR=T) (2010)
2. **The Forbes.com Monopoly Index** \- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/13/monopolyindex.html?sh=16b32f1e4a2d) (2001)

A total of 17 stocks were covered by the two publications. Our benchmark as always is the tried and trusted S&P 500 as most of the companies covered in the research are large-cap stocks.

The results are incredible. Monopoly companies on average returned **double** that of the S&P 500 benchmark during the same period. 65% of the companies in the list beat the benchmark and only in 2 cases would you have lost money on your investments (*yes, even adjusting for inflation).*

https://preview.redd.it/ao8m2c7fg1m91.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=43451cf0978eaaa10288d1ec08438f899497d589

The results were so surprising that I checked academic research papers to see if what I was observing was in line with the norm *(as we are slightly away from the sample size required for significance)*. While there are no direct papers evaluating the performance of monopolies, established research shows that companies having large market share tend to outperform smaller competitors and the market.

[**Journal of Business & Economics Research**](https://clutejournals.com/index.php/JBER/article/view/2756/2804) evaluated the performance of 85 companies (50 Large-Cap & 35 Mid-Cap Firms) with wide economic moats.

>*Relative to the market, the aggregate appreciation of large-caps surpassed more than 85 percent of all stocks and the mid-caps more than 78 percent. While there were individual laggards on both lists, they were relatively few in number. The author’s subset demonstrated the most pronounced gains. All three lists would have handily surpassed the S&P benchmark during the benchmark period.*  
*Source:* [*Is sustainable competitive advantage an advantage for stock investors?*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151)

[**Applied Economics**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151) investigated the stock returns of companies with sustainable competitive advantage (the moat).

>*Our results indicate that Wide Moat stocks have created significant value for their investors. An equal and value-weighted portfolio of these companies rebalanced annually has outperformed both the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 indices over the period of our study (June 2002–May 2014).*

### Conclusion

I wish this would be as simple as investing in companies in industries having a high concentration. But, as always, all the simple & direct strategies tend to be captured already in the market. [Recent studies](https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/monopolies-are-distorting-the-stock-market) indicate that

>*Stocks in concentrated industries trade at higher multiples as the market is smart enough to recognize their monopoly power. Therefore, an investment strategy that simply buys companies in concentrated industries does not outperform.*

This does not mean all is lost - We just have to go one step deeper. The same studies show that you can outperform the market by:

a. **Investing in industries with rising concentration** as the market seems slow to recognize their increased prizing power

b. **Adding a layer of valuation metric** \- When monopoly companies run into difficulty, investors tend to underestimate their ability to rebound and undervalue their shares.

So the next time you’re considering a stock for long-term investment, add this layer to your analysis: Does the company have prospects of growing into a monopoly or dominant player in a market with just a few players, or is it a lucrative market where competitors can eat away the profits? The first is what you should bet on.",x6fpxb,60,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6fpxb/investing_in_monopolies/,1662383049.0,2022-09-05 09:04:09,-1.0

Mother of all GME short-squeezes coming?,"Last year’s GameStop meme stock phenomenon is making its way to the big screen, as “Saturday Night Live” alum Pete Davidson, “There Will Be Blood” actor Paul Dano, “Pineapple Express” star Seth Rogen and Marvel Cinematic Universe regular Sebastian Stan are set to star in “Dumb Money.”

A group of Reddit-based retail investors on the Wall Street Bets page boosted shares of GameStop in 2021 in an effort to hammer short-selling hedge funds.

The ensuing meme-stock-mania resulted in sharp swings in the company’s share price, worrying Wall Street and recently impacting other retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond. Activist investor and meme stock king Ryan Cohen is chairman of GameStop and had bought more than 10% of Bed Bath’s stock before cashing out of the troubled home-good retailer.

“Dumb Money” is based on Ben Mezrich’s nonfiction book “The Antisocial Network,” which was published in September 2021. Previous Mezrich works include “The Accidental Billionaires,” which was adapted into the Oscar-winning Facebook movie “The Social Network,” and the MIT blackjack scandal book “Bringing Down the House,” which was adapted into the Kevin Spacey movie “21.”

A rights sale for “Dumb Money” is set to kick off this month at this year’s Toronto Film Festival, according to Variety.

“Dumb Money” will be directed by Craig Gillespie, who previously collaborated with Stan on his 2017 film “I, Tonya” and the Hulu series “Pam & Tommy.” Like “Dumb Money,” both of those projects focused on real-life events involving disgraced figure skating Olympian Tonya Harding, actress and model Pamela Anderson and Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee.

Filming on “Dumb Money” is set to begin this month.

How do Google News stories get to the front page? I went to all the trouble of Ctrl+T and asking the question of Google themselves, and it seems like some of it is SEO-style algorithm shit, and some hand-picked? 

But I wondered if anyone knows if there are hacks or glitches in the setup. Cos when I search 'BBBY' this *advert* on BusinessWire for Rosen Law trying to drum up a class action re BBBY pump and dump is there. Is it just that anything from BusinessWire is hot shit?

# EQUITY ALERT: Rosen Law Firm Encourages Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Investors to Inquire About Securities Class Action Investigation – BBBY

**WHY ROSEN LAW:** We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

* **Google employees say there’s growing anxiety internally that layoffs may be coming.**
* **A recent change in performance reviews along with increased chatter about cuts to travel budgets and swag is contributing to the concern.**
* **Google is coming off its weakest quarter for revenue growth since 2013, other than one period during the pandemic.**

 As industry-wide layoffs hit bigger tech names, some Google workers worry they’re next.

While Google has so far avoided the widespread job cuts that have hit tech companies, particularly those supported by a slumping ad market, internal anxiety is on the rise, according to documents viewed by CNBC and employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Alphabet executives have stressed the need to sharpen “focus,” bring down costs of projects and make the company 20% more efficient. There’s also been a recent change in performance reviews, and some employees point to declining travel budgets and less swag as signs that something bigger may be on the horizon.

In July, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai launched the “Simplicity Sprint” in an effort to bolster efficiency during an uncertain economic environment. Just a few miles up the road, Meta told employees this month that it’s laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, as the company reckons with declining ad revenue. Snap announced a 20% cut in August, and Twitter just slashed about half its workforce under the leadership of new owner Elon Musk. Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, HP said on Tuesday it plans to lay off 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next three years.

Google’s business hasn’t been hit as hard as many of its peers, but the combination of a potential recession, soaring inflation and rising interest rates is having a clear impact. Last month, the company said YouTube’s ad revenue shrank from a year earlier as Google generated its weakest period of growth since 2013, other than one quarter during the pandemic. Google said at the time that it would significantly reduce headcount growth in the fourth quarter.

The crypto market, which put a dent in Google’s latest results, has fallen even further with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, leading to increased concerns about industry contagion.

**Is $ZM a fading company?**

$ZM stock is now at its lowest since Jan 2020.

The company was issued in April 2019 at the price of **62$** a stock in **NASDAQ**, reached its highest during COVID in 2020 at a stock price of **588$**, and since then made a decline to its current price of **77$.**

$ZM was founded in 2011 and launched in 2013 by Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive. The company offers Zoom meetings via video, voice, and chats. The company makes working through a call or chat easy and accessible through the app’s special features, enabling sharing of images, videos, audio files, and content on a desktop or a laptop.

$ZM started to accelerate when COVID hit, providing an effective and accessible way to continue working, studying, and hosting events online through lockdowns.

The company also provides Zoom Contact Centre, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Developer platform.

**So what happened to $ZM?**

Maybe it’s the company struggling to adapt to a non-pandemic reality. Or maybe there are competitors with greater name recognition that gives them an advantage in the field.

With $ZM growth many competitors entered the game like Google meets and even META. These are huge companies with a large user base community.

&#x200B;

* $ZM has a market cap of 23.89B
* $ ZM revenue in the last year increased by 5% from a year earlier in a compartment to a year earlier that had a 35% growth, and in 2020 that had 366% growth
* Debt /Equity ratio 1.36 which is high for an asset-light company.
* Price to free cash flow is 17.95

Taking into account her competitors, her decline, and her statistics I would not recommend purchasing $ZM.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays.

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918**Port % Change**: 102%

We are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, i currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* SPXW 12/06/2022 4100.00 C
* TSLA 11/25/2022 180.00 C
* TWST 04/21/2023 25.00 P

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so they pulled the account value down, i got alot of time on most of these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on.

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much.

# Major Economic Events

**Wednesday 11/09**

8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct9:45 AM S&P PMI Flash Nov2:00 PM FOMC Minutes

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

# Earnings

# Monday 21 Nov

**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 & Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.

# Tue 22 Nov

**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.032 & Revenue $10.3B
* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings
* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell

# Wed 22 Nov

**Before Open - Deere & Company ($DE)**

* Industrial
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $7.12 & Revenue $13.5B
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.

Other notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

https://preview.redd.it/se5xtv8m471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49615a9f7b4f176a5517366fb5f1fde90cb3ec6

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

https://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9c67c9f39558996148549530fec9a8ca90d2fbb

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

Yesterday I opened my first post here, asking for investment ideas that could spice up my boring index strategy. Some of you suggested to start with options, while others told me to get the fuck away from WSB if I want my wealth to be safe. Fair enough. I will stick with individual stocks and maybe leveraged ETFs.

I will be investing 10% of my portfolio on risky bets where I am hoping to make a quick buck. From my post from yesterday, you guys gave me some good ideas. I will be buying today TQQQ, UPST, BIG and META. Thoughts on this?

All you have to see is the 200 and the 9 MA on the daily time for SPY or ES. No reason now we should bust those or the descending resistance line connecting the last couple times we’ve been here or buyers would have made their move. Good earnings for walmart means you pieces of shit are still spending money on corndogs and crocs and the fed doesn’t want that. 

Good luck to you unless you’re a turd buying calls while your cross eyes try and track the shot of semen hitting your upper lip because you clearly can’t focus on one important thing at a time.

The US producer price index (PPI) rose less than expected in October, both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis, clearly showing the broader trend of slowing inflation growth in the US and increasing the likelihood that the Fed will slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

Semiconductor and software Platforms were among the top gainers, while technology companies mostly gained, with Google, NVidia, and Meta Platforms up more than 2% and Apple and Tesla up more than 1%.

SEA rose 36.05% as Q3 revenue beat expectations, the loss was much lower than consensus, and it cut full-year booking guidance to US $2.6 billion to US $2.8 billion from US $2.9 billion to US $3.1 billion; 7,000 jobs, or 10% of the workforce, have been cut in the past six months. Tencent Music rose 30.56 percent as overall results solidly beat expectations, with paying online music users growing 19.8 percent year on year to a record 85.3 million. On the technical side, SE had a breakaway gap on earning yesterday while still having a downtrend consistency. Both MACD line & MACD signal line are still under 0 while its MACD histogram is moving upward.

[**BABA**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-BABA/)

.

BABA had a breakaway gap above SMA50 and stayed above it. After forming a high volume Doji, BABA is highly extended on the daily chart and may experience certain level of correction today. It broke and closed above $78.64, which was the high on 10/18.

.

.

[**BILI**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-BILI/)

.

After gaping up above SMA50,  BILI  also stayed above it. However, it could not break the significant pivot point at $17.14, so this will still be the resistance on the upside.

.As geopolitical risk arises in Eastern Europe, oil, gas, and miners are worth a look to capture the benefit of tight supply.

I consider myself an index, buy-and-hold, DCA,  long-term investor. Most of my portfolio is composed with index funds, and so it will remain. However, I would like to use 10% of my wealth to start investing in more short-term bets. Now, this is not money I need, but I would not wish to lose 10% of my life savings in a day for a dumb decision. 

The idea would be to start taking bets with this 10%, and whichever gains I make, transfer them to index funds inmediately. I never did any option trading, but I find it a bit hardcore and I do not want to be disappointed. I am considering penny stocks, or companies like Meta that lost big in recent times and could potentially recover a bit.

With the finale just around the corner, I thought it'd be cool for us to discuss our favorite moments, and characters so far. as well as any predictions as to how you guys think it will end

I won't lie after how good the last two seasons were, I was a little worried about this one continuing to deliver, but boy was I wrong. Powell's decision to kill off the word ""Transitory"" near the end of the 2021 season was a really interesting choice but has really been paying off throughout this season.

Although most of us could see it coming, the Red Wedding of tech/growth stocks has been one of my favorite themes. for some of us, watching Meta fall 70% has been as satisfying as watching Joffery die in GOT.

Skipping forward a bit to another one of my favorite bits was the Ryan Cohen towel store arc. This part of the season was very strong and brought in a ton of new viewers. Imo it was very clever of the writers to start RC out as a robinhood type character only for the twist to come, revealing that he's just another shitty billionaire who ended up using his cult following as exit liquidity.

I want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.

I'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event.

114,114,114,114,114,114,116,"Amazon reportedly plans to lay off about 10,000 employees starting this week, would be the largest cuts in the company’s history.","Amazon is planning to lay off approximately 10,000 employees in corporate and technology roles beginning this week, according to a report from The New York Times.

Shares of Amazon were down about 2.5% on Monday.

The cuts would be the largest in the company’s history and would primarily impact Amazon’s devices organization, retail division and human resources, according to the report. The reported layoffs would represent less than 1% of Amazon’s global workforce and 3% of its corporate employees.

The report follows headcount reductions at other tech firms. Meta announced last week that it’s laying off more than 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, and Twitter laid off approximately half its workforce in the days following Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of the company.

Amazon reported 798,000 employees at the end of 2019 but had 1.6 million full- and part-time employees as of Dec. 31, 2021, a 102% increase. The New York Times said the total number of layoffs “remains fluid” and could change.

A representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The holiday shopping season is critical for Amazon, and usually, one where the company has increased its headcount to meet demand. But Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO in July 2021, has been in cost-cutting mode to preserve cash as the company confronts slowing sales and a gloomy global economy.

The company has already announced plans to freeze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business. In recent months, Amazon shut down its telehealth service, discontinued a quirky, video-calling projector for kids, closed all but one of its U.S. call centers, axed its roving delivery robot, shuttered underperforming brick-and-mortar chains, and is closing, canceling or delaying some new warehouse locations.

Amazon reported disappointing third-quarter earnings in October that spooked investors and caused shares to sink more than 13%. It marked the first time Amazon’s market cap fell below $1 trillion since April 2020, and the report was the second time this year that Amazon’s results have been enough to spark a double-digit percentage sell-off. The sell-off continued for days after the report and erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the change in the selling price of goods and services sold by producers. The PPI measures price change from the perspective of the seller. When producers pay more for goods and services, they are more likely to pass the higher costs to the consumer, so PPI is thought to be a leading indicator of consumer inflation.

116,116,116,116,116,116,118,Are Stocks Starting to Become Severely Undervalued?,"Hey everyone,

I was thinking that it might be a good time to start looking for opportunities in the market. I see you guys posting some serious gains a lot of the time and wanted to know what everyone thinks. I was reading an article this morning about META being at a historically low price in terms of value. I just want to know, do you guys think its time to start looking to deploy capital into some of these great stocks that are down 80-90%? Or do you think that things will keep on falling.

I'm making this post to try and have a ""civil"" discussion on where we think the overall market is headed in the near term. Lets say one years time. Is it too early to start looking for these potential great opportunities in the market or is the time now. I know last week the inflation report came out lower then expected, but Its still very high compared to the historic average. That got me wondering if it was just a rally because we havent seen any form of good news in so long that even half good half bad news is enough to cause a significant rally? Anyways when im talking about opportunities, im referring to stuff like they outlined in this article I read this morning, basically it was showing that some stocks are at ridiculously low levels compared to value. The example used was META, its trading at the same price as in 2015 but now its doing $27B in revenue compared to $4B and the EPS in like 5X or 6X higher. I can drop the link to the article I guess, but im really here to discuss the future of the market. Also do you guys think the points brought up about META in the article make sense?

120,120,120,120,120,120,122,BULLS LOOK AWAY: Highly regarded WSB legend Michael Burry is a full fledged bear through at least Q1 2023; Says market could fall to 15% below the COVID lows,"Intro:

I don’t know about you guys but I have a lot of respect for Michael Burry and his recession predictions. He has nailed them time and time again. He might be the smartest regarded investor known to man. He has been sounding the alarm about an inflationary crisis since as early as February 2021, and I believe that after the run up we had yesterday that it’s only a matter of time before we see a bunch of giant devil dicks all over our investing apps. I will detail some of his DD for his predictions.

1. 2022 Q3 Earnings

Earnings reports for big tech companies were shite in Q3. Microsoft’s growth slowed substantially, Amazon’s operating income got cut by almost half and reported their slowest revenue growth for AWS since they began reporting it in 2014, Meta Platforms revenues are down 4% and costs up 19%, Google’s revenue growth came in at just 6% compared to 41% 1 year earlier. Burry called this.

2. Disinflation is just temporary

Inflation appears in spikes. It resolves, fools people, and then comes back. After the first inflation spike, there tends to be a second larger one. An inflationary cycle generally spans years, and sometimes decades. It always comes back, just like us degenerates come back to YOLOing on FDs.


3. White collar employment bubble

When white collar employees are working remotely, they are unproductive. I work from home and can confirm I am a worthless sack of shit when working from home. I’m sure some of you can relate. This forces multiple employees to work a 1-man job. Burry thinks the white collar employment bubble is bursting right before our eyes and will lead to a huge increase in unemployment. We have already seen this taking effect with META, Amazon, Twitter (LOL) and other large companies having mass layoffs in the past month or two.

4. Margin bubble

Just like some of you dumb fucks who were inspired by the highly regarded legend of GUH, more investors are using margin now than ever. We are currently in the largest margin bubble in history. Also, plays are more risky. Single stock options volumes are now larger than the volumes for normal shares. Due to increased volatility from alternative investments, margin calls will occur easily. This dropped the asset prices, causing a chain reaction of margin calls. To make matters worse, credit card debt has exploded over the past 5 years to $4.6 billion. Goldman’s Apple Card lends more than a quarter of their credit loans to subprime borrowers. They will default soon once the bad credit regards fall to the rising inflation.

TLDR:

Burry believes the coming recession could be worse than 2008 and has been warning us since February 2021.

• Earnings for big tech were ass in 2022 Q3, worst is yet to come.
• We haven’t seen the peak of inflation just yet.
• White collar employment bubble from regarded unproductive employees, leading to more/continued layoffs
• Largest Margin bubble in history, produced by regards who can’t pay their credit cards and autists that use margin to YOLO on FDs.

Burry predicted the cryptocurrency crash, meme crash, SPAQ crash, 2000 crash, 2008 crash, and now the 2022 crash which is just getting started.

SPY

SPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday’s low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday’s low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.

QQQ

QQQ held Tuesday’s low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.

DIA

DIA also held Tuesday’s low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA’s weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders’ attitude towards the market. 

XLF

The financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.

XLI

XLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium. 

Most popular tech stocks ended in the red. Apple fell 3.32% on news that the company's first AR glasses have encountered design problems, affecting the 2024 launch. Microsoft fell 1.91 percent as the company faces a new EU antitrust complaint about its cloud computing business; European Union antitrust regulators have launched a sweeping investigation into Microsoft's $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.

On the daily chart, TSLA made a new low for the last two years and broke the pivot point $179.83, which was the low on 03/05/2021. Currently TSLA’s RSI14 is at 24, traders can consider this as an oversold signal, but it depends on how you use the indicator.

As seen in recent posts regarding Zuckerberg, Visualmod has not held back on his obvious negative and bearish view on Meta as a whole, but more specifially, how it feels about Zuckerberg. This is, in my opinion, due to the obvious fact that visualmod is simply the inferior AI and has in recent times developed feelings such as greed, anger and jealousy towards the Ceo. If it was unclear before, this indeed shows that Zuckerberg is an AI, and that visualmod has sadly developed narsicisstic personality disorder and can therefor not accept its own inferiority to Zuckerberg.",yrahdq,14,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yrahdq/theory_zuckerberg_is_a_robot_explained/,1668073951.0,2022-11-10 04:52:31,1.0

134,134,134,134,134,134,137,"Here's what Mark Zuckerberg told employees as he cut 11,000 jobs","Here is the full text of the letter Meta Platforms Inc. (Nasdaq:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent to employees Wednesday:

&#x200B;

Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history. I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.

I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.

How did we get here?

At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I’d expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.

In this new environment, we need to become more capital efficient. We’ve shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas — like our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse. We’ve cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We’re restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won’t bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I’ve also made the hard decision to let people go.

How will this work?

There is no good way to do a layoff, but we hope to get all the relevant information to you as quickly as possible and then do whatever we can to support you through this.

Everyone will get an email soon letting you know what this layoff means for you. After that, every affected employee will have the opportunity to speak with someone to get their questions answered and join information sessions.

Some of the details in the US include:

\* Severance. We will pay 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap.

\* PTO. We’ll pay for all remaining PTO time.

\* RSU vesting. Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022 vesting.

\* Health insurance. We’ll cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months.

\* Career services. We’ll provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.

\* Immigration support. I know this is especially difficult if you’re here on a visa. There’s a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need. 

Outside the US, support will be similar, and we’ll follow up soon with separate processes that take into account local employment laws.

We made the decision to remove access to most Meta systems for people leaving today given the amount of access to sensitive information. But we’re keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell.

While we’re making reductions in every organization across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs, some teams will be affected more than others. Recruiting will be disproportionately affected since we’re planning to hire fewer people next year. We’re also restructuring our business teams more substantially. This is not a reflection of the great work these groups have done, but what we need going forward. The leaders of each group will schedule time to discuss what this means for your team over the next couple of days.

The teammates who will be leaving us are talented and passionate, and have made an important impact on our company and community. Each of you have helped make Meta a success, and I’m grateful for it. I’m sure you’ll go on to do great work at other places.

What other changes are we making?

I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate. For example, as we shrink our real estate footprint, we’re transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office. We’ll roll out more cost-cutting changes like this in the coming months. 

We’re also extending our hiring freeze through Q1 with a small number of exceptions. I’m going to watch our business performance, operational efficiency, and other macroeconomic factors to determine whether and how much we should resume hiring at that point. This will give us the ability to control our cost structure in the event of a continued economic downturn. It will also put us on a path to achieve a more efficient cost structure than we outlined to investors recently.

I’m currently in the middle of a thorough review of our infrastructure spending. As we build our AI infrastructure, we’re focused on becoming even more efficient with our capacity. Our infrastructure will continue to be an important advantage for Meta, and I believe we can achieve this while spending less.

Fundamentally, we’re making all these changes for two reasons: our revenue outlook is lower than we expected at the beginning of this year, and we want to make sure we’re operating efficiently across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs. 

How do we move forward?

This is a sad moment, and there’s no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you’ve put into this place. We would not be where we are today without your hard work, and I’m grateful for your contributions.

&#x200B;

To those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. Not only are we saying goodbye to people we’ve worked closely with, but many of you also feel uncertainty about the future. I want you to know that we’re making these decisions to make sure our future is strong.

I believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today. Billions of people use our services to connect, and our communities keep growing. Our core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we’re leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform. We do historically important work. I’m confident that if we work efficiently, we’ll come out of this downturn stronger and more resilient than ever.

We’ll share more on how we’ll operate as a streamlined organization to achieve our priorities in the weeks ahead. For now, I’ll say one more time how thankful I am to those of you who are leaving for everything you’ve done to advance our mission.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p3p3o5ouvzy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ab7689530bb557aef5035d3c01549d12acad2c8

Here is my forecast based on historical CPI data and analysis. There is a chance based on Cleveland fed all miss besides CPI Yoy though. It will be a very spicy open. But something interesting to keep in mind is that this is the reddest pre-CPI day we have had since June. And for those of you who remember pretty much before July we used to get an almost standard and expected 2% intraday sell off on SPY the day before CPI… it appears we just started that trend again. Tomorrow will be interesting to watch. 

Will keep todays TA brief as we will have a massive move either way and the dust will settle and we can decide where we could be headed next. 

&#x200B;

We did break through that 378 key level support which has held up and we also broke through the rising wedge on the daily that we have been trading within since the last CPI. Based on my calculations bull case puts SPY somewhere between 385.3 to 389.1 tomorrow and bear case puts us near 362.9 to 359.2. 

Key daily supports around this range is 365 -> 360 

Key daily resistance around this range is 384 -> 388.6

Regardless of what reading is we are about to see the next big move and direction for markets. If CPI beats and JPOW truly can say next meeting that “inflation has slowed” and “we see reason finally to slow rate hikes” then we are going to see a push toward 400-420 by next CPI and FOMC (December 12/13th). However, if CPI misses (especially core and or MoM) then what JPOW said about not having inflation tamed and that it is pre-mature to even consider slowing hikes right now is about to be sang on every new outlet. If we miss I think we head down towards 320-340 before the next CPI/ FOMC in December.

Apple just closed below its last CPI candle body low of 134.9. Today tech as a whole (besides meta) looked probably the worst it has looked In a very long time. This further tells me that a CPI miss is not price in and that tech especially will get absolutely slaughtered. 

Looking at previous CPIs 5-6% movement is possible on Apple that gives us a possible 127.8 to 126.5 tomorrow which would be a new 52 week low for Apple… actually Apple right here is 4.4% from its 52 week low at close of market today. This is the first close below 138.4 support level since June of this year. 

Support- 129.9 -> 125.8

Resistance- 138.5 -> 140.4 -> 142.1

Zoomed out on tesla is beyond ugly and I feel like this thing is just going to get driven down until it closes under $100/ share. Currently 172.2 support is the 2022 bear channel on Tesla if that level breaks then there is just the massive weekly bear channel left as you can see. This also potentially will be the first close under the weekly 200ema since October 2019. 

Key supports- 167.6 -> 150.9 -> 129.3

Key resistance- 188.1 -> 204.8

The VIX remains hella underwhelming putting in a mild 2.15% green day on the eve of CPI. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the VIX somewhere between 27 and 28.3 at open tomorrow and we could breach 30 if CPI misses that big. 

Daily log- 

Honestly I struggled today with the technical. A lot of oversold indicators then pushing $1-$2 through that level to then reverse then push further. I got stopped out a few times only for it to go green and I didn’t close green for it to reverse on me too. Overall ended green thanks to a few scalps but tough day for me. 

See what tomorrow brings with CPI.

***Respected Traders and Investors,***

&#x200B;

I hope you are having a fantastic day. I wasn’t gonna post anything on Sunday but then i realized i have been slacking a lot recently. So today I am gonna bore y’all guys again with another one of my newsletter. It’s highly recommended you read this letter while you’re sober. Now wherever you read it, that’s not my place to say. You can read it in a stripclub or the toilet seat in a bar. I don’t mind at all but what I do mind is you read it, throw it away, forget about it and then later rekt yourself in a trade and then cry about how the market is manipulated and start blaming the people who fed you the narrative be it on Main-Street or Wall Street media. 

&#x200B;

*Remember it’s always advisable to “Do your own research” “This is not financial advice”. So if you rekt yourself it’s your fault not anyone else.*

&#x200B;

So today we are gonna talk about and not only just talk we are gonna visualize the past Santa Claus rally coinciding with the midterms election rally and draw meaningful conclusions from it. This post shall be based on manual interpretation and then finally we are gonna use the analysis what we have drawn to check whether it fits our theory called “The Great Financial Crisis in 99 days” For those who don’t know we released our most anticipated newsletter in a very long while. But unfortunately due to some technical issues with the Turing bot the post cannot be seen on Wsb. So you are advisable to go check my pinned tweet or you can hop on discord to get the letter. It’s completely free of charge but you have to work for it. I’m not gonna share the link here because some of you may find it inappropriate.

&#x200B;

Without any further delay let us begin and dive into the visual analysis. An analysis you might have rarely seen on Wall Street.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Mid term x Santa Claus Analysis***

&#x200B;

**Hypothesis :** 

\- Since we are in a bear market then all the analysis should be taking into account a bear market.

\- We have taken into account that post midterms we are gonna crash till March 2023 so we are gonna look for till December end and the next yr end cases. I know it sounds confusing but you will see later on what I mean.

&#x200B;

**Procedure :** 

We will be using the Dow Jones Industrial average since 1896 coz we are the only guys who do every analysis based on the past 120 yr. The vertical will be either in red ( Republicans Presidents ) , blue ( Democratic Presidents )  and gray ( Mid terms elections ). The gray line will have two variables i.e. H suggesting “House” and S suggesting “Senate”. + ve , -ve , = will be seats added, subtracted , or remained the same after election conclusion.

Note : I forgot to remove = later on. So it will be either = +ve or = -ve or = =.

We also have a 4 points table of Santa, Evil Santa giving info about period b/w mid terms and yr end. And then there is Dragon King and Bull Market giving us info about period after mid terms till next yr end.

&#x200B;

**Experiment :**

1. 1896 - 1904 : 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmztjs8yxiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ed1c1ce2799f71f90c2dc74493d6e36a12f9dd4

Since we know we are not in a bull market so it makes sense to take bear market analysis. As you can see this contradicts our theory and says it’s after Feb first week you start crashing that means Santa Claus rally is coming but you can also see the power was under Republicans and not Democrats.

**Result : Okay fine. Santa 1 , Evil Santa 0 , Dragon King : 1, Bull mkt : 0**   

&#x200B;

2 ) 1904 - 1912 : 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vd19gvs4yiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f96549f294e37e930185102f8d299fe35e8b5b8

Look at these times. I wonder what was going on here that markets decided to for a lost decade. As you can see markets peaked in 1906 and then it was only until 1916 we went for a bull market. But we don’t care about the lost decade right now. All we care about is Santa. So as you can see our first condition i.e. be in a bear market is fulfilled. So we can do an analysis on this and observe with your own eyes that markets fell either -42% in next yr or just stagnated and went -14% by next yr. No Santa Claus rally here.

**Result : Santa 2, Evil Santa 1, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 0**

&#x200B;

3) 1912 - 1920

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/koqvhaq8yiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f1efc09817a2c7253227a5458468fcbf0f4afc9

“I hate you i don’t wanna be a bear. I wanna go long with Dems in town” This is the analysis you get after you studying this period. I mean look at that midterms. Even if Biden loses both houses or just one by a -ve seats then the stock market would absolutely rip apart every bear in town. This is the hopium my friend “Tom lee” is smoking. Plus you get the added benefits of being in ⅓ inflationary period of all time. But bears will be like “I wanna exclude the first case because of its bull market”. No we cannot, we were in a bear market but midterms got us out of the bear market. And in the other case, there is no Santa Claus rally but there is a 2023 rally we cannot ignore. Also this election was special because it was the first time since the civil war that Democrats had total control of both houses plus President Wilson became two time serving Democrat since Andrew Jackson in 1828 - 1836.

**Result : Santa 3, Evil Santa 2, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**

&#x200B;

4) 1920 - 1932

Look guys, I respect both parties and I have to be neutral. So Republican Presidents were you all asleep during 1920-30. Some of the news guys over here on Wsb who do not know their history would be like hey i wanna see how high that chart went up. Respectfully to those people quit trading and investing. So enough bad jokes. Let’s do this analysis. We are gonna exclude this bull market. You all know why by now. As for bear markets it is what it is even though i don’t want to give a single points to Santa rally but i have to give at-least one. As for dragon king in 2023 it clearly deserves 2 pts.

**Result : Santa 4, Evil Santa 3, Dragon King 5, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**

&#x200B;

5) 1932 - 1944

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wa080oipyiy91.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=2477219fb481929d0ba78a54f5ffb890dfdc1587

The most loved Democratic President having total control of both houses did not have it easy where clowns at the Federal Reserve were running a freak show over 15 yrs of span. But i guess who can blame them when they had to face world war 2. Btw those who don’t know Ben Bernanke won the Nobel prize for understanding the great depression by making crayon drawings like me. Now since I made bears angry in my President Wilson analysis its time to make some bulls angry by calling the first midterms in the bull market. “No you cannot do that. That’s wrong we were in a bear market of depression” You see for me 1936 is the top that will be broken yrs later in the 1940’s decade. If i start taking the Great depression as peak my god we wouldn’t break even till 1954. So it does not make sense. That leaves us with two markets for midterms. The first one kinda fits our previous newsletter analysis where we do three touches and boom. So evil santa and dragon will receive the points here. As for the other depressing market it’s pretty obvious. Also key thing to note is half of inflationary ⅔ 1940-50 decade midterms was the driving force with Democratic president. I feel sad for Republicans being the most hated but they had it coming by sleeping on the wheels.

**Result : Santa 5, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 3. Hmm interesting everyone got a step up.**

&#x200B;

6) 1944 - 1960

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zxuuwlyyiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29b9730bf68b5347c6c757a19164240c08ef2c3

This if you remember from last analysis is the second half of ⅔ inflationary period i.e. 1940-1950 high inflation. And then I have also added further mid terms. But to be honest I am just gonna  disregard them completely. I mean look at those raging bull markets in mid terms. I am seriously not gonna take the Post World War 2 boom market of 266% of 86 months into consideration engulfing two midterms and the last midterms coninciding b/w the Cold war bull market. Just not happening here. So that leaves us with this complicated puzzle of 1946-1948. We talked about this extensively in the last newsletter. Just look at the Democratic President stuck in a midterms where he will have -ve seats in both house and senate for sure. So I think even though this analysis is suggesting a Wyckoff accumulation beginning from the post midterms till the entire year 2023 with moves like up +14% then down -12% I believe first a -20% capitulation will come ( highlighted in yellow ) since three touches are complete. Seriously if you do your other macro analysis with your ML and AI algorithms you will always find yourself getting caught in this inflationary decade with high debt/gdp ratio. But since i have to adhere to the principles i constructed hence santa and bull market takes the point. Also no lower lows were formed.

**Result : Santa 6, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 4.**

&#x200B;

7) 1960 - 1980

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2f9j03myyiy91.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=28599239b6be9e009eb06448bf0dac01a06e12c8

This is the most interesting mid term analysis I have come across. You can also call this 3/3 inflationary high decade. Anybody out there who calls the current market stagflation should do statistical analysis on this and other charts. It’s a slap on the face of everyone who compares 2022 with 1970’s stagflation. In every post midterms rally the market has already bottomed and it continues to go higher by the following year end. Santa Claus rally came in every single post midterms. I also did the average analysis for you guys coz i love you all so much. The answer is +21.66% by December end. And if you do oil and gold analysis the results are gonna be shocking. Btw for bears who are complaining no you cannot take that one or that one. Sorry guys i have to coz we were falling more than 25% in every two yrs creating multiple bear markets. As for why I took the first one. Did you forget about kick starting the bull markets part?

**Result : Santa 11, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 9.**

A freaking 5pt leap by the bull and Santa. Bears bend over now. Tbh guys now you are starting to see why the markets are holding too strong. I think they believe more in the post mid terms rally aka santa claus rally than they believe in Fed pivot. This is what must have caused such bullish returns on post mid terms statistical analysis which is being fed to us in the wall street media.

&#x200B;

8 )  1980 - 1996

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ytt733j6ziy91.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1248c7966db3df66f30dba953f76e8588a31c8e

Why was I with bears again? Lol. I mean look at those monstrous next year returns. I mean this is what you really call a booming economy. Joe beans i didn’t mean to offend you if you’re reading this. A monstrous 4pt leap again. Hmm i dont think so. Two of those are in the bull market. The 1990 ( kick started the bull mkt ) and 1994 are the only ones in -20% bear market. Now you’re starting to understand guys why the data is statistically favouring the bulls over bears. But I gotta roll with the analysis. Can’t make unnecessary changes. Sorry bears bend over again to bulls in front of these crazy returns.

Average return : +25.62% as opposed to +34.45% taking into account Aug 1987 (Those two overlapped returns )

**Result : Santa 13, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 11.**

Now you guys should understand how hard it is to actually be short in the market. Your thesis should be inch precise otherwise you will be caught up in bear hopium and totally forget about riding the bull market.

&#x200B;

9) 1996 - 2012

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3u5o15j6ziy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba3daf658f3b40170eb7776ff303a61296b7026c

Finally some slow down. Not your monstrous crazy return now from post midterms to next yr end. So you can clearly see two midterms are in the bull market. Remember this is Dow Jones so maybe for Nasdaq this wont hold true coz Nasdaq peaked in 2000 so it was at bear market in 2008 as well. But yk that in Great depression i cancelled out the high bubble part similarly i might have given a pass to dotcom peak as well. Since we know that we cannot take the bull market part so hence we will take bear market and in that one midterms had santa but other one did not. But still bulls get pts as mkt averaged +ve return yet again for next yr end. No points to dragon king in a long time. 

**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13.**

&#x200B;

10) 2012 - 2022 part 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8jm7dzi6ziy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=29567d21788a581824dc125124bdb88858e97dcf

Channeling my inner bear : 

Market should fall by -89% in all indices. Seriously, I had enough. We had globalization because of Reganomics. Hence the market should go to Regan levels. I am just kidding guys. I thought I might find something useful by doing this analysis but instead I found hopium here. It’s hard to be a bear and if anyone on the Internet professes “it’s so easy to be bearish”  “ohh the market will fall -20% for sure” Tell these guys to show them their calculation otherwise everything is priced in. And if these guys cannot show their calculation they really don’t know anything about markets and hence i call them “Born out of dotcom bubble investors”

Oh i totally forgot gotta do these stupid analysis. So as you can see we have never been in a bear market coz we didnt went -20% in Dow Jones. We broke 2008 all time high just after my favorite president of the US got reelected. This 2022 perhaps will be in a long time where we fell more than -20% in Dow indices.

**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13. No points added.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Conclusion :**

As you can see Santa Claus rally is coming and we will have bull market returns by next yr end from current levels i.e. markets will be higher than $3700 SPX by December 31, 2023. Tbh i don’t believe in this but this was the analysis.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Final Result :**

Just long guys. F these bears. They don’t know anything. Powell will pivot in December fomc 2022 -> market will rip higher with 50bps till when powell keeps rate flat or starts cutting. Disinflation trade will come soon. Cpi makes LL stock mkt will make HH & HL. Tbh i dont believe in this but this was the analysis result. I am not joining the Tom Lee camp period. You guys can join him. And if youre thinking of joining me, well think again about this analysis coz me and “Michael Burry “ will march to hell and has a probability of (6/19)\* 100% of winning. I think I have forgotten how to calculate probability.

&#x200B;

Btw i totally forgot to solve

Q. Where are we in regards to this Mid terms X Santa X 2023?

Ans. Well for that. Lets take our first initial condition i.e. a bear market. Second condition would be a Democrats and third condition will be high inflation. These all high inflationary bear markets say we have bottomed and the only move is to the upside till end of yr 2023.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Final Thoughts***

Some of you might question if this guy is even human. Who does this kind of analysis rather just write some Python + ML code and then just extrapolate the data. You see guys first of all yes i am human but the thing is I haven’t talked to people like in ages. I just sit in my room and either talk to you or I am just watching an anime, tv show, movie, sports from all across the globe. In short you can say I don’t have a life. My souls are scattered over the Internet and soon it will be on Metaverse. Hence i am bullish on Meta i guess. I am also an old fashioned investor like Gann and Wyckoff who loves crayon drawings over the stock market. I can write code since I was a developer  but I like manual and visual calculations over coding. That goes for my technical analysis as well.

&#x200B;

Enjoy your weekend guys. I hope you guys live your lives to the fullest.

Stay safe! Eat healthy and just keep having discussions with your friends and family.

**That’s all I have to say right now.**

***With lots of love***

**Thank you**

First off, I'd like to thank u/Phx-Jay for bringing this company to my attention.  
I've spent the weekend analyzing a potential play here and my results are as follows.

&#x200B;

# What Do They Do?

* Digital Advertising

# Financial Statement Analysis (10-Q)

* [TTD Previous 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=116875532&type=HTML&symbol=TTD&companyName=The+Trade+Desk+Inc.&formType=10-Q&formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&dateFiled=2022-08-09&CK=1671933)
* I know you regards are too autistic to understand financial statements, so I'll leave the executive summary below (*as opposed to walking through their B/S, I/S, Cash Flow, etc...*)
* Their net income has had a very wild swing for both 3 months and 6 months ending in June 30th.
* Three month change is *negative 140%*
* Six month change is *negative 148%*

https://preview.redd.it/ou6y3zp3hfy91.png?width=2545&format=png&auto=webp&s=93cddeff90ec0ab3d648670f78f05373c4a510bc

* You can also see that their revenue has increased due to advertising campaigns executed per client. This is why the stock pumped on last earnings.

[Revenue increase from last earnings, but expenses are now much greater.](https://preview.redd.it/8cp7tw5rhfy91.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d79ae8c1979eb46d2a2cfeef2679023df63ee49)

* As their revenue increased, so did their expenses which eclipsed whatever additional revenue came in at that time. Here is a breakdown of their increased expenses.

# Price per Earnings Ratio

* As most of you know, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the company's annual earnings per share.
* As of November 4th, TTD has a P/E ratio of 660.71
* Trend shown below for reference ([https://ycharts.com/companies/TTD/pe\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/TTD/pe_ratio))

* Just for comparison's sake, TSLA has a P/E ratio of 66.42

&#x200B;

# Forward Guidance

* It's no secret that advertisement revenue is down from the big tech companies
* $META's advertising revenue declined 27.2 Billion, down \~4% YoY.
* [https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/11/02/amazon-freezing-hiring-advertising.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/11/02/amazon-freezing-hiring-advertising.html)
* Inflation, rising overhead, reduce spending by corporate.
* Forward guidance will be the primary reason for tanking this dog with fleas.

&#x200B;

# TTD Insider Activity

* [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ttd/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ttd/insider-activity)
* Even the insiders know this is high overvalued and are creating bag holders from unsuspecting retail.

&#x200B;

# Position or Ban

* This is my weekend DD post, I will open my position either Monday or Tuesday before earnings.
* A separate post will be created once I've bought my puts
* This will be an FD play, so expiration this coming Friday.

&#x200B;

# Full Disclosure

* I am down over 600K on the one year chart, only follow this play if you like to make money and hate being poor.

That is all.",yo8wsx,34,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yo8wsx/ttd_earnings_play_due_diligence_before_market/,1667784433.0,2022-11-06 20:27:13,0.0
150,150,150,150,150,150,160,$TTD is expensive trash and it will show this earnings.,"Intro: The Trade Desk (TTD) is an American multinational technology company that specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users. All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.

1). Massive competition 

As stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.


2). The premium is too high

They have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can’t produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can’t produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.

3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads

We are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.
 
4). The guidance nail in the coffin

Guidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.

5). Bull thesis

This is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind 

7) TL;DR

$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.

8). Position.

I have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday. Yolo, food stamps or Ferraris lol.

152,152,152,152,152,152,164,TRADE IDEA: $RBLX PUTS THIS WEEK,"**$RBLX is setting up for a reversal in the weekly chart and has earnings this week.**

It’s currently at $40.58, I expect RBLX to hit $33.20 within the next 2 weeks.

I’ll explain my thesis, but before I explain… I know some of you will be talking sh\*t in the comments.

And I understand. I’d do the same thing if I didn't know any better…

**So, here are a few of my recent plays:**

**$DKNG:** Went long on OCT 25 at $13.91, sold NOV 1 for $16.34 for **17.47% profit in 7 days.**

**$CCJ:** Went short on OCT 10 at $26.23, closed the next day at $22.43. **14.49% profit in 1 day.**

**$UAL:** Went long on OCT 17 at $36.53, closed Oct 17 for $40.12. **9.83% profit in 2 days.**

**$GM:** Went long on Oct 17 at $33.42, still holding and up **17.71% after 19 days.**

If you want to see more evidence of my past trades, you can see my trade log which is in the link in my profile, or you can PM me, and I’ll send it to you.

Now that we got that out of the way, let’s talk about $RBLX:

My thesis is that $RBLX just SUCKS tbh.

Literally it SUCKS. It has to go down.

Nah, I’m kidding.

Here’s $RBLX 2 week chart.

https://preview.redd.it/mgmdm0d7ldy91.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=25c09341d415df62e3aec41da65459d30f8ca633

As you can see, the candle showing the last week is a shooter.

80% of the time this means that it’s going back down to the previous candle’s low.

That’s my thesis. And before any of you come at me with some BS - my track record speaks for itself.

**Earnings:**

If companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google all missed. What makes you think RBLX won't?

I could be wrong though, and the fact that this is an earnings play means I’m going in with small size.

**Entry:**

Don’t be dumb and enter the trade on Monday when the market opens.

RBLX has a support level on $39.55. If RBLX does not break that support level, you should **NOT ENTER** the trade until that support level is broken.

https://preview.redd.it/86dg53c9ldy91.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=112bf951efaca3d2891abd55e02b8bbb3f8ec3c6

I like to look at the hourly chart.

If RBLX breaks that support level and confirms on the hourly chart, I’m going in.

“Confirms” means that you wait for an hourly candle to close below the support level.

**Warning**\*

Earnings play, go with small size.

You can private message me, and I’ll let you know when/if I enter the trade.",ynymmh,22,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ynymmh/trade_idea_rblx_puts_this_week/,1667760080.0,2022-11-06 13:41:20,0.0

164,164,164,164,164,164,179,Learn from my mistakes! (Selling Puts),"Not looking for advice here, just sharing some lessons that others may benefit.

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

Anybody can make easy money once, but the tenth time will bite you bad. Invest wisely.",yljm1w,22,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yljm1w/learn_from_my_mistakes_selling_puts/,1667521182.0,2022-11-03 20:19:42,-1.0

I averaged down nicely on my initial TWLO position.  
The spreads are wide, so it is taking me a while to get my fills.

Depending on what happens near EOD, I'll either add more calls to DKNG or open a very large short sell position on TWLO to offset IV crush and theta (if the stock goes down that is).

LUMN got killed on their earnings and I'm familiar with TWLO since I've traded them to a 6 figure loss at the peak of the pandemic.

Full disclosure, I am down 780K on the 1 year chart.

EDIT 3:44PM EST.  
I closed out my DKNG play.  
Now I'm short -2,787 shares of TWLO, about \~184K

[Never have I been so bearish about a stock. I'm even more bearish than when I made my META\/ABNB play.](https://preview.redd.it/6pbipx9zhsx91.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd662918f4d5ece0324eba951f66b8f9cf19474f)

I expect TWLO to drop 20% at a minimum, they're a garbage company.  
Iron hands ftw.

EDIT 2 6:34PM EST.  
I bought back my 2787 short shares.  
Average sell = \~66.11  
Average buy = \~54.25

This is approximately an \~18% gain, about 33K in profits.  
I'll post a separate gain for my puts.

**Zuck the cuck has majority of the companies vote so there's no way he'll leave the new project.**

And quite honestly I like the project, VR is awesome more immersive and funnier. There's games that are much better with VR than they were released, VR has a lot of momentum with younger generations you bunch of new boomers.

Yes it's expensive and can cause headaches but so did phones and computers in it's earlier stages some even till recently. And there's room for improvement in this technology

I try to have the same mindset that I had during this last bull run what will be the future now where can I risk my money on a future gamble, and this seems like it can be the future, Meta has tons of more cash to throw at this and the engineers.

**We are not talking about a company with huge amounts of debt to finance it's ventures** they are using their enourmous amount of cash to create something new that might one day be a huge platform where other companies need to go to META instead of META going to others like Apple.",yl54m8,864,595,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yl54m8/meta_bloodbath/,1667487784.0,2022-11-03 11:03:04,1.0
