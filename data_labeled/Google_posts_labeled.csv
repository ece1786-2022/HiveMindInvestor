0,0,0.0,Here is another potential sign about COIN,"Take it with a grain of dirt(can't even afford salt).

Today, I wanted to stock up on some more Algo(yeah, you can hate me for buying crypto still).  Looked at my payment methods and it shows Google Play.  Hmm, weird.  Checked on my phone next - also says pay with Google Play.  Looked into my account: my ACH method was removed.

No warning.  No notifications.  No anything.

Now, they want me to use some Plaid company to have my information about my bank and such.  That is a hard no from me.  For the record - been using CB since 2017.

I posted on their reddit and it seems to be a growing issue.  My coworker also uses CB and his ACH(different bank and a big named one at that) was also removed.  Neither of us can manually re-add our institutions.

So, that combined with the current trend of COIN in general = me pulling everything out.  CB had a good run.  They will also probably make it through the storm:  I give them about a 70% chance.  I just personally cannot trust them anymore.

1,1,1.0,Apple and Elon Musk’s Twitter are on a collision course," 

* **Musk wants to vastly increase the amount of money the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more “free speech.”**
* **This creates a risk that Twitter could violate Apple or Google’s app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.**
* **Battle lines are being drawn. Last week, Musk complained about app store fees, which are between 15% and 30% of digital sales, in a tweet.**

 Elon Musk has announced big, albeit confusing, plans for Twitter since he took over the social network last month.

Musk wants to vastly increase the revenue the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more “free speech,” which in some cases seems to mean restoring previously banned accounts like the one owned by former president Donald Trump.

But Musk’s plans for Twitter could put it in conflict with two of the biggest tech companies: Apple and Google.

## Tensions are brewing

One of the biggest risks to Musk’s vision for “Twitter 2.0” is the possibility that his changes violate Apple or Google’s app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.

Tensions are already brewing. Musk complained in a tweet just last week about app store fees that Google and Apple charge companies like Twitter.

“App store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly,” Musk tweeted. “It is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.” In a follow-up post, he tagged the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, which is reportedly investigating app store rules.

His complaint is over the 15% to 30% cut Apple and Google take from purchases made inside apps, which could eat into the desperately-needed revenue from Musk’s plans for $8 per month from Twitter Blue subscriptions.

Over the weekend, Phil Schiller, the former head Apple marketing executive who still oversees the App Store, apparently deleted his widely-followed Twitter account with hundreds of thousands of followers.

2,2,2.0,"Google has avoided mass layoffs so far, but employees worry their time may be coming"," 

* **Google employees say there’s growing anxiety internally that layoffs may be coming.**
* **A recent change in performance reviews along with increased chatter about cuts to travel budgets and swag is contributing to the concern.**
* **Google is coming off its weakest quarter for revenue growth since 2013, other than one period during the pandemic.**

 As industry-wide layoffs hit bigger tech names, some Google workers worry they’re next.

While Google has so far avoided the widespread job cuts that have hit tech companies, particularly those supported by a slumping ad market, internal anxiety is on the rise, according to documents viewed by CNBC and employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Alphabet executives have stressed the need to sharpen “focus,” bring down costs of projects and make the company 20% more efficient. There’s also been a recent change in performance reviews, and some employees point to declining travel budgets and less swag as signs that something bigger may be on the horizon.

In July, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai launched the “Simplicity Sprint” in an effort to bolster efficiency during an uncertain economic environment. Just a few miles up the road, Meta told employees this month that it’s laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, as the company reckons with declining ad revenue. Snap announced a 20% cut in August, and Twitter just slashed about half its workforce under the leadership of new owner Elon Musk. Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, HP said on Tuesday it plans to lay off 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next three years.

Google’s business hasn’t been hit as hard as many of its peers, but the combination of a potential recession, soaring inflation and rising interest rates is having a clear impact. Last month, the company said YouTube’s ad revenue shrank from a year earlier as Google generated its weakest period of growth since 2013, other than one quarter during the pandemic. Google said at the time that it would significantly reduce headcount growth in the fourth quarter.

The crypto market, which put a dent in Google’s latest results, has fallen even further with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, leading to increased concerns about industry contagion.

You can get a copy of the workbook from Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KA_zsB9ZvZkqvg1Oj9OF4fRKk8MCI1d8pyhynri8BSk/edit#gid=1763493701). As always, feel free to reach out with feedback/suggestions/etc. I want to make these as helpful as possible. **If you have an idea, let me know**. Odds are that I will bake it into a future release. 

The next update will be in early December.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $122.7M to $302.3M (+146%)
* Sales increased from $976M to $8.74B (+795%)
* Transactions increased from 470 to 1,006 (+114%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 333 to 530 (+59%)
   * Net buyers increased from 36 to 64 (+78%)
   * Net sellers increased from 297 to 466 (+57%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 451 to 881 (+95%)
   * Net buyers increased from 43 to 115 (+167%) 
   * Net sellers increased from 408 to 766 (+88%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **November 14th - November 18th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Indirect** transactions are now included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **November 7th - November 11th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by the algorithms behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

4,4,4.0,How a prop firm actually works.,"Listen up gamblers, this is very important if you ever decide to pursue speculation past toilet bowl stock picks and swag YOLOs.

A firm is always fundamentally driven. There is not a single fund out there besides electronic market makers that trade purely off of technical analysis. All of your candlestick astrology and oscillating spaghetti is useless without fundamental backing. Many of you who are even mildly skilled will realize that statistically, pattern recognition on its own is Gaussian. This means that most of your trades will break even or lose slightly with outliers on either side due to plain luck.

That being said, Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets is a Murphy classic. Read it.

The firm who I do bidding for has a standard cabal. I have to listen to who I'm assigned, and I'm not allowed to talk about or know certain things. I am an intern for a swing trading desk and my job is to find high alpha levers for the projections that our AI produces. 

Most of you don't really understand what a trader really does. They are responsible for knowing and understanding complex correlations in the economy and how to effectively profiteer their firm's research with financial instruments. Communication is one of our most important objectives. Without information, we have no advantage. 

If you want to get to this level, you have to study. You will never get past the crowd of losers without having knowledge that is competitive. If you don't want to put the work in, you deserve to lose. This means that a five-minute Google spree will not lead you to a big winner. News is always lagging reality. Having a one-sided bias will always lead to big mistakes.

6,6,6.0,Is $ZM a fading company?,"&#x200B;

**Is $ZM a fading company?**

$ZM stock is now at its lowest since Jan 2020.

The company was issued in April 2019 at the price of **62$** a stock in **NASDAQ**, reached its highest during COVID in 2020 at a stock price of **588$**, and since then made a decline to its current price of **77$.**

$ZM was founded in 2011 and launched in 2013 by Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive. The company offers Zoom meetings via video, voice, and chats. The company makes working through a call or chat easy and accessible through the app’s special features, enabling sharing of images, videos, audio files, and content on a desktop or a laptop.

$ZM started to accelerate when COVID hit, providing an effective and accessible way to continue working, studying, and hosting events online through lockdowns.

The company also provides Zoom Contact Centre, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Developer platform.

**So what happened to $ZM?**

Maybe it’s the company struggling to adapt to a non-pandemic reality. Or maybe there are competitors with greater name recognition that gives them an advantage in the field.

With $ZM growth many competitors entered the game like Google meets and even META. These are huge companies with a large user base community.

&#x200B;

* $ZM has a market cap of 23.89B
* $ ZM revenue in the last year increased by 5% from a year earlier in a compartment to a year earlier that had a 35% growth, and in 2020 that had 366% growth
* Debt /Equity ratio 1.36 which is high for an asset-light company.
* Price to free cash flow is 17.95

# The Real Estate Dilemma

""My home is worth less than my portfolio, real estate market is tanking, this company is screwed""

dude. IT ISN'T A DILEMMA. THIS TRASH REAL ESTATE MARKET IS THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR MATTERPORT. Mr. Joe Shmoe who bought his 1b/1b for 5x asking price is getting more and more desperate to sell to any buyer. In order to try to beat the other sellers, what option does Joe have? Matterport his house. 

Hurricanes destroyed your house and you needa rebuild? Matterport to preview, design, and insure your house.

About a year ago, I equated Matterport to a shovel play. Matterport isn't a shovel play. Shovels only spike during the gold rush, It's an alcohol play. 

You find gold? you party and you drink.

You don't find gold? You cry and you drink more.

Kid's birthday? Drink

Whatever the hell event: YOU STILL DRINK.

Regardless of real estate, with more people deciding to rent than own because of the market, renters would still want to see and explore a location before they decide. 

Need to rent a venue? Decide where to travel to? Same thing. 

# The Facebook Dilemma:

How is this a dilemma? In fact, if anything the single reason meta is down should be the same exact thing pumping Matterport. Mr. Zuck has basically said fuck it to all the other parts of his company except the sector dealing with MATTERPORT.

# Shorts:

My opinion here, but Matterport is in a situation that is super easy to see negatively. ""The growth tech stock that is deeply rooted in the real estate market and has partnered with $META..."" Everything in that description screams short candidate.

I really don't know how accurate this is and I have no idea how to verify, but fintel says SI is [46.48% SHORT?!?!](https://fintel.io/ss/us/mttr) 

However, despite the opinion MTTR keeps beating expectations and is getting completely dogged on, imo, just because of the sector they're in. 

&#x200B;

I don't wanna push any likelihood of a squeeze, but I do think that it is currently way undervalued and has at least some potential to squeeze up. (especially if fintel data is remotely accurate, which it probably isn't, iunno. My brain hasn't a wrinkle in sight.)

# Positions:

I HODL'ed past the 4x gain because I'm some random unknowledgable retail investor who became an expert Jan '21 because yes. but I do believe in the company and their product. \~5000 shares, avg 6.25 and Ima keep averaging down if I can get that Wendys offer letter.

&#x200B;

NFA Im poor enough; don't sue.

Also open to any other thoughts. I may have missed something or not understood something.

8,8,8.0,Uniper Long DD,"Uniper(ticker UN01 on the Frankfurt stock exchange) is a German energy generation and trading company. 
It operates through 3 segments : European Generation, Global commodities,  and International Power generation. 
Basically, it buys and sells LNG to Germany, and other countries.

The price per share used to be 40€. It tanked to 2.6€ at its lows.

That's because it used to purchase the LNG from Russians. Who then decided to cut the pipeline supplying Germany (Nord Stream 2)

Over the past week, however, there has been a **massive rally** from 4 to 7 € per share.

This is because of 2 reasons : 

1. Germany is ahead of schedule on their regasification project.

The filling level of the natural gas storage facilities in Germany has cracked the 100 percent mark : 

https://www.boerse.de/nachrichten/Gasspeicher-Fuellstand-in-Deutschland-knackt-100-Prozent-Marke/34324736

(Use Google translate) 

2. The linchpin of the regasification of the big cities of Germany, is dependant on an infrastructure called the FSRU, the Floating Storage Regasification Unit. Uniper builds those units. And the first one is about to come online in Lubmin, followed by another in Wilhemshaven. 
They are set to deliver 4.5 billion cubic meters of LNG per year, starting december first. 
This is why I'm very bullish even though the stock has jumped by more than 3fold from the past month. I see this going to 10, or even 12 when the terminal comes online and they are able to supply LNG to heat houses and power industries.",z1npv8,5.0,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z1npv8/uniper_long_dd/,1669103147.0,2022-11-22 02:45:47,-1.0

11,11,11.0,FDA Approves the First-Ever Lab-Grown Meat Product,"On Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration for the first time ever approved lab-grown meat — in this case, chicken created by California startup Upside Foods — as safe for human consumption.

Singapore officially opened the market for Franken-flesh last year, when startup Eat Just gained regulatory approval to sell its “chicken” to consumers.

The development pushed fundraising in the industry into hyperdrive, including a $400 million Series C raise scored by Upside Foods in April. While the California startup still has a few hoops left to jump through — including USDA inspection — the FDA’s all-clear marks a major domestic breakthrough. Fake meats are widely expected to radically reshape the food industry and it’s not just farm animals that should be celebrating:

•Cultured meat could likely be produced with 96% less greenhouse gas emissions, 96% less water use, and 99% less land use than traditional animal food production, according to research from Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit published in the academic journal Environmental Science & Technology. We’ll add that it also can be produced with 100% fewer animals.

•“Our own research indicates that alternative protein growth will continue exponentially through the late 2020s and early 2030s, with the sector reaching dominant market share in around 2035,” Rosie Wardle, co-founder of food tech-focused VC firm Synthesis Capital (which invested in Upside Foods), told TechCrunch.

Upside’s product will initially be sold at a price premium, though CEO Uma Valeti tells TechCrunch the firm believes it will eventually achieve price parity — and even a more affordable price point — with conventional meat as the company scales.

12,12,12.0,Ryan Cohen is helping hedgies naked short GameStop and I can prove it.,"To any lurking Apes: It should concern you how the Apes in this thread are yelling that i’m wrong, yet none of them are able to state *how* i’m wrong. Turns out your *peers* are pretty dumb.

**The top upvoted comment trying to prove me wrong can be disproven by a ten second GOOGL - but you won’t do that. You’ll just upvote it and continue losing money on a shit investment rather than actually doing some DD for once.**
_____

Ryan Cohen as CEO and Chairman of the board of GameStop has what is known as a **fiduciary duty** to it's shareholders.  This is a legal requirement inherent in most every board/executive position in any business.  Business 101.  In fact, shareholders can sue if they believe directors and officers are breaching their fiduciary duty.

In a nutshell, fiduciary duty is all about ensuring that board members never allow any outside interests or personal affiliations or allegiances to interfere with their responsibility to shareholders.  Which of course means working towards a profit and value return to those shareholders.

It goes without saying that this means that the Chairman must defend the company from certain things, including even hostile take over.  For example we've seen the ""poison pill"" discussed a lot this year - a nuclear option board members have actually considered using to protect shareholders.

Apes claim hedgies are attacking GameStop through naked shorts etc and that Ryan Cohen knows.

**Therefore, Ryan Cohen is a hedgie.**

Proof:

1.	⁠Directors and officers of a corporation have the duty to stop interference from outside forces.
2.	⁠If they do not, then they have breached their fiduciary duty.


1.	⁠Hedgies are interfering with GameStop. A board has a fiduciary duty to take action to stop the interference.
2.	⁠Ryan Cohen is the Chairman of the Board of GameStop.


1.	⁠**Therefore, Ryan Cohen has a duty to stop the hedgie interference.**
2.	⁠Speaking publicly about CRIME would not only help stop the interference, but also protect and inform shareholders.
3.	⁠**Therefore, not speaking publicly about CRIME is a breach of his fiduciary Duty to GameStop (this one's extra, not needed for the proof, but serves as an example)**


1.	⁠Ryan Cohen has not stopped hedgie interference.
2.	⁠**Therefore, Ryan Cohen has breached his fiduciary duty to GameStop Shareholders.**


But why?  There's only two explanations.  1) He just sucks at this.  2)  He is working for the hedgies.  Well, three explanations.  It could be one of those two, **or it could be that you're in a cult and everything you know is wrong.**",z05tem,0.0,349.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z05tem/ryan_cohen_is_helping_hedgies_naked_short/,1668955417.0,2022-11-20 09:43:37,-1.0

14,14,14.0,Puts on Activision? NASDAQ: ATVI,"[NASDAQ: ATVI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ATVI/)



Activision has been trading near 52 week high of $86 for most of the last year with hopes of Microsoft acquiring the company. 

> **Microsoft transaction**

> As announced on January 18, 2022, Microsoft plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share in an all-cash
transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and completion of regulatory review. The
transaction, which is expected to close in Microsoft’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, has been approved by the boards
of directors of both Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and by Activision Blizzard’s stockholders


There has been a lot of drama about it and the deal seems to be on hold indefinitely... until EU decides that it's kosher. 

[EU opens investigation into Microsoft, Activision Blizzard merger](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/11/08/eu-microsoft-activision-acquisition-call-of-duty/)


Recently though there has been some worrying news involving Activision. 

[Activision Blizzard games to go offline in China after NetEase deal falls through](https://www.ft.com/content/2d3a2351-8c19-4e11-bf16-54d05a668840)


> China is the world’s largest gaming market, but foreign developers need a local partner to distribute their games in the country. Beijing also heavily censors gaming content and controls the number of new releases through a licensing system.

> Activision Blizzard said on Thursday it was unable to reach a deal to renew a licensing agreement with NetEase, one of China’s largest game developers and publishers, which has distributed the games in the country for years.

> The California-based company said last week that the NetEase agreement in dispute accounted for about 3 per cent of its net revenues last year, translating to roughly $264mn in sales.

[Here is the latest earning report](https://investor.activision.com/static-files/67c7ad10-e540-4152-a3e4-5323b329920a)


> For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, Activision Blizzard’s net revenues presented in accordance with GAAP were
$1.78 billion, as compared with $2.07 billion for the third quarter of 2021. GAAP net revenues from digital channels were
$1.61 billion. GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.55, as compared with $0.82 for
the third quarter of 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, Activision Blizzard’s operating margin was 34% and earnings per diluted
share was $0.68, as compared with $0.89 for the third quarter of 2021.
Activision Blizzard generated $257 million in operating cash flow for the quarter as compared with $521 million for the
third quarter of 2021.


Stock is trading at its current price just with hopes of the Microsoft deal, which to me seems be getting more and more unlikely.


With relatively poor performance and a shrinking market, Blizzard may well drop down to its 52 week low of $56 or even lower. 


You decide if it's worth gambling.

Agilent maintains a very solid gross margin of \~50% in the past 4 years. A lot is to be desired when it comes to their operating margin. With an SG&A at round \~50% of the gross profit, Agilent is a firm that operates under the pressure of heavy expenses. That being said, the P/E sits nicely at 35x, down \~8% from last year but still solid. Revenue growth at \~5% y/y (see spreadsheet).

I think the main takeaway here is that Agilent has remained stable in a very volatile industry, though largely predicated by the nature of their instrument + service angle. They operate in three main business areas.

I think the main question is growth. Assuming y/y at 5%, the current market price doesnt reflect the most up-to-date DCF. If anything its got a -20% upside. I recommend $112.32, but judge for yourself. A lot will be indicated by Q422 set to drop on the 21st of this month. If their Q4 doesnt rectify some of the growth issues, there might be some short or mid term options play.

For us value bros the financials dont look great. I wouldnt go into Agilent with any sort of confidence on a short position. Like I said earlier a lot is to be desired, but I think the Q4 will most likely reflect some 8-15% growth at which point you might go long and pray for epic P/E. I might add that EPS is up 71% for Q421. They also run a repurchasing program. Most likely the Q422 EPS will be at 4.2, from there growing steadily at \~5% y/y. Hard to tell.

It has **dynamic dashboards for Form 4 filings.** To view it on Google Sheets, check it out [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KA_zsB9ZvZkqvg1Oj9OF4fRKk8MCI1d8pyhynri8BSk/edit?usp=sharing). I suggest copying, not sure if everyone could use it at once.

**Please share any feedback!** The plan is to continue to improve upon both the reports and analytics while also rolling out a web-based application for real-time alerts. Let me know how you dig it.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from \~$127M to \~$239M (+89%)
* Sales increased from \~$3.69B to \~$6.5B (+77%)
* Transactions increased from 845 to 954 (+13%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 452 to 546 (+21%)
   * Net buyers increased from 65 to 77 (+18%)
   * Net sellers increased from 387 to 469 (+21%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 736 to 849 (+15%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 129 to 122 (-5%)
   * Net sellers increased from 607 to 727 (+20%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **November 7th - November 11th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Indirect** transactions are now included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 31st - November 4th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

BABA had a breakaway gap above SMA50 and stayed above it. After forming a high volume Doji, BABA is highly extended on the daily chart and may experience certain level of correction today. It broke and closed above $78.64, which was the high on 10/18.

.

After gaping up above SMA50,  BILI  also stayed above it. However, it could not break the significant pivot point at $17.14, so this will still be the resistance on the upside.

.As geopolitical risk arises in Eastern Europe, oil, gas, and miners are worth a look to capture the benefit of tight supply. On the other hand, with the loose monetary policy and its low valuation, China stocks are worth a look towards the end of the year. Both MACD line & MACD signal line are still under 0 while its MACD histogram is moving upward/

25,25,25.0,$ASTS just went from speculative play to semi-nuclear squeeze as shorts double down (detailed DD inside),"Hey peoples,

By now most have heard of ASTS. I won't go into extreme DD around the company but here is the summary that matters:

1. ASTS is a player in the Satellite Communications (much like Starlink)
2. Unlike Starlink they do not require special equipment to receive the signal and their tech can be utilized with any regular phone
3. They will accomplish this by launching MASSIVE satellites with +600 SQFT area. Bluewalker 3 (the catalyst behind all this craziness) has been launched in September and is now confirmed to be ""unfurled"" (i.e. unraveled) and ready to be tested in earnest. Check out the size of this bad boy

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9m6ytpf4zz91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcbd63527a157aa801a847be06e6ffb0679b9fe

4) This is a HUGE catalyst to the company as it shifts the investment proposition from a binary opportunity of the ""tech works?"" to a scalability and ramp up problem. It is no exaggeration to say the next coming days and weeks will be the most important in the company's history

5) Major industry players just as Vodafone, AT&T, Rakuten and others are already invested in ASTS and many have even released videos with their CEOs/CTOs/COOs demonstrating their confidence into ASTS tech and the overall company. You can find them on the company's Youtube channel.

At this first glance, we might be tempted to discard this as another run-of-the-mill YOLO but with some DD of your own you can quickly arrive to a different conclusion. You might realize there is currently a huge tug of war between retail investors and a large short fund, which has ""double-downed"" today as an attempt to stem the insane pre-market rally of +20%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i7r22nf9azz91.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=9341624196f103c042dc78ac078342c03c055bd4

Their efforts were successful as the stock pulled back to -5% at this time of this writing.

However, it came at a cost.

Below is the funding rate for ASTS short positions. Notice how the funding fee (now at 20%) has been inching up (while available shares persistently below 50k) since Nov 9th when the speculation that Bluewalker 3 had unfurled successfully started to be confirmed by the astronomer community. There are currently ZERO shares available to borrow and some users are reporting their brokers reaching out to them to borrow their shares. Any re-borrowing will come at least 25-30% rate if not higher.

At the same time today we saw a record number of submissions for institutional buys at pre-market including Goldman Sachs, Vanguard, JP Morgan and others as evidenced below. Notice today's filling date on the last 9 fillings.

https://preview.redd.it/s0um2x6w3zz91.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=205ed3e7a60dd576bc2a2a0795ebcacb82ddcced

Why is today such a big deal?

Cause the earnings call with unfurl announcement is happening TODAY at 5pm. The short thesis best bet is to stifle the excitement through massive sell pressure (potentially even FUD questions during the call) and hope that sentiment carries over the next couple of weeks to give them time to cover.

The company has already announced via social this morning that the deployment was successful and 3 hours later a record short position was reinforced with the borrowed shares mentioned above.

The short sellers are panicking and with good reason. When companies migrate from binary thesis (""is this even possible?"") to a scale/ramp-up problem, they are usually met with large amount of trench funding. This has happened with a multitude of companies such as SpaceX, AirBnB. Uber, Google, etc etc. We are exactly at that point with ASTS where the technology is weeks or even days of being completely validated. This will continue to act as a catalyst.

Now combine that with the fact that nearly 40% (that's right FORTY percent) of the entire float is short. When you consider institutional ownership + insider holdings (which by the way have not sold a single share since public listed other than for tax purposes) you can see how this can become a powder keg as the funding rates spike.

With a functional Bluewalker3, ASTS will literally become the new leader of Satellite Communications, even surpassing Starlink in growth potential. ASTS will move away from ""will it work"" to ""will it scale"". Large positions from outside investors are soon to follow.

Finally, social awareness is starting to rise. They already have +9k followers on Twitter but daily gains are accelerating and so is engagement.

Not bad considering that even established companies struggle to hit 50k followers.

As testing progresses and AST gets more exposure, this trend is bound to accelerate with Reddit not far behind

October CPI rose 7.7% y/y in October, better than the expected 7.9%, compared with 8.2% in September; core CPI rose 6.3% y/y, better than the expected 6.5%. The ""entrenched inflation"" theory has faded as prices growth in the new and used vehicles and medical care categories slowed m/m. And as consumers gradually feel the pain from Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking (it takes time for monetary policy to reach consumers) + recession fears depress spending, providing the potential downward path for future inflation. However, investors should keep that in mind recession risk is looming.

On the other hand, Democrats retained control of the Senate after holding Nevada seat over the weekend, the House outcome is still undecided (though Republicans likely win). Many believed that Republicans will win both chambers easily due to high inflation and multiple large bills passed by Democrats, but it seems untrue. Americans are still optimistic about future under Democrats’ leadership.  

Big things happened in coin industry last week. The world’s second-largest coin exchange, FTX, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as the company faced insolvency and liquidity crisis.

**Chip stocks jumped, can Nvidia's earnings report be a surprise or a scare?**

[Semiconductor stocks](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/semiconductor-stocks/)

As risk appetite rebounded, high-growth chip stocks experienced big rally last week, ASML jumped nearly 23%, TSMC, Lam Research rose more than 18%, Nvidia, AMD rose more than 15%.

TSMC's October said last Thursday it recorded the company’s second highest-ever monthly sales in October, with NT$210.27 billion ($6.61 billion), up 56% year-on-year and up 1% m/m amid demand worries. Analysts said growing demand for smartphones, high-performance computing (HPC) devices and automotive electronics boosted shipments of chips made on TSMC's 5nm process.

AMD launched its 4th-Gen EPYC Genoa Zen 4 processors for data center last week and said Microsoft’s Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Corp would be some of its customers. Genoa makes significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency compared with its previous chip, ""What that means for enterprises and for cloud data centers is that it translates into lower CAPEX, lower OPEX and lower total cost of ownership,"" said CEO Lisa Su.

Nvidia’s new A800 GPU chips, an alternative to A100 GPU, started selling in China last week, which complies with the US export restrictions amid “tech decoupling” between US-China. The company will release its financial results after the bell on Wednesday, Nvidia’s share price has risen nearly 60% from its October low. Although market sentiment has picked up, the fundamentals are essential for the company valuation, how’s latest GPU 4090 selling, the inventory level of legacy GPUs and forward guidance are critical, investors will carefully watch whether the chip stocks’ rally can be sustained.

[Oil Stocks](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/oil-and-Gas-Stocks/)

Industrial, banking and oil stocks continue to rise last week as Fed may start slowing the speed of rate-hiking. 

Among industrial stocks, Caterpillar and Nucor rose nearly 4%, Vulcan Materials rose over 5%, and GE rose over 6%. With Democrats retaining control of the Senate, Biden’s spending on infrastructure continues to play out.

Among bank stocks, JPMorgan Chase rose more than 3.5%, Bank of America rose more than 4%, Morgan Stanley rose nearly 7%, Citi rose more than 11%. With lower treasury rates, investors expect big banks' non-interest segment (wealth management, investment banking, etc) is expected to see a recovery.

Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum rose more than 1%, of which Exxon Mobil, Chevron shares are at record highs. As China loosened some Covid zero rules, investors expect the demand for oil & gas will increase, which pushes the oil prices higher. 

It is worth mentioning that Walmart will announce its earnings on Tuesday, investors can evaluate the change in consumers' spending habits amid inflation and recession fears, and it whether improves or deteriorates, which can be a barometer for the health of the US economy. ",yv0gh7,16.0,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yv0gh7/market_weekly_recap_faamg_chip_software_sectors/,1668434913.0,2022-11-14 09:08:33,0.0

And what better thing to bring back than Jurassic Park Chaos Effect? Look man, we all know Jurassic World Dominion was a fat sack of shit but it grossed $2 billion dollars. It doesn’t matter if the movie respects cannon or makes endless plot holes. Its motherfuckin dinosaurs baby! Jurassic World and Camp Cretacious are done, son. I guarantee that Jurassic Park Chaos Effect is coming. Spielberg won’t cancel it this time; he doesnt care about art, only money. But UVV isnt even the half of it my friends.

Half of damn youtube is people making their own Ultimasaurus from current Jurassic Park figures. When Universal and Spielberg finally gives the ok; this toy is going to make us Lambo driving millionaires. But thats still not all. We got Ron DeFuckme Santez on our side.

Traded tqqq for a fast $50, again I am not cut out for short term day trading, Not even week long trading. I need to look for stuff that has 8 weeks to 2 years of holding time. 

So this came across my desk this morning. Amazon ( when it was coming down from 98.5 to 97.5 ) and I am crunching numbers. Did my math and analysis. Went **long** ( when Amazon was at 100 ) with **October 2023 145 calls @ 4.26** ( yep that's my trade, horrible fill ), I do expect that by 12/26 I should have a solid grasp of the probable outcome. looking to exit around 19 when it's trading 144-ish by march 7th ( 3 x risk reward ), and if the uptrend holds shoot for 25 ( 5x risk reward) by may 18th around the 160 price. 

Now speaking about Tesla, I think this Insulin Eli Lilly fake account thing in twitter will have a correlation issue   [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/)  Will lead to a freaking huge lawsuit against Elon's groups and team. The One key part of that legal landscape is **Section 230**, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content ( right from google search ) clearly states immunity. Here is the problem, someone was able to buy the blue check mark, without the quality control of the past, it's not so clear cut anymore.

31,31,31.0,BULLS LOOK AWAY: Highly regarded WSB legend Michael Burry is a full fledged bear through at least Q1 2023; Says market could fall to 15% below the COVID lows,"Intro:

I don’t know about you guys but I have a lot of respect for Michael Burry and his recession predictions. He has nailed them time and time again. He might be the smartest regarded investor known to man. He has been sounding the alarm about an inflationary crisis since as early as February 2021, and I believe that after the run up we had yesterday that it’s only a matter of time before we see a bunch of giant devil dicks all over our investing apps. I will detail some of his DD for his predictions.

1. 2022 Q3 Earnings

Earnings reports for big tech companies were shite in Q3. Microsoft’s growth slowed substantially, Amazon’s operating income got cut by almost half and reported their slowest revenue growth for AWS since they began reporting it in 2014, Meta Platforms revenues are down 4% and costs up 19%, Google’s revenue growth came in at just 6% compared to 41% 1 year earlier. Burry called this.

2. Disinflation is just temporary

Inflation appears in spikes. It resolves, fools people, and then comes back. After the first inflation spike, there tends to be a second larger one. An inflationary cycle generally spans years, and sometimes decades. It always comes back, just like us degenerates come back to YOLOing on FDs.


3. White collar employment bubble

When white collar employees are working remotely, they are unproductive. I work from home and can confirm I am a worthless sack of shit when working from home. I’m sure some of you can relate. This forces multiple employees to work a 1-man job. Burry thinks the white collar employment bubble is bursting right before our eyes and will lead to a huge increase in unemployment. We have already seen this taking effect with META, Amazon, Twitter (LOL) and other large companies having mass layoffs in the past month or two.

4. Margin bubble

Just like some of you dumb fucks who were inspired by the highly regarded legend of GUH, more investors are using margin now than ever. We are currently in the largest margin bubble in history. Also, plays are more risky. Single stock options volumes are now larger than the volumes for normal shares. Due to increased volatility from alternative investments, margin calls will occur easily. This dropped the asset prices, causing a chain reaction of margin calls. To make matters worse, credit card debt has exploded over the past 5 years to $4.6 billion. Goldman’s Apple Card lends more than a quarter of their credit loans to subprime borrowers. They will default soon once the bad credit regards fall to the rising inflation.

TLDR:

Burry believes the coming recession could be worse than 2008 and has been warning us since February 2021.

• Earnings for big tech were ass in 2022 Q3, worst is yet to come.
• We haven’t seen the peak of inflation just yet.
• White collar employment bubble from regarded unproductive employees, leading to more/continued layoffs
• Largest Margin bubble in history, produced by regards who can’t pay their credit cards and autists that use margin to YOLO on FDs.

Burry predicted the cryptocurrency crash, meme crash, SPAQ crash, 2000 crash, 2008 crash, and now the 2022 crash which is just getting started.

That being said, I will be buying $QQQ and $SPY puts next week.",ysji3z,243.0,208.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ysji3z/bulls_look_away_highly_regarded_wsb_legend/,1668193096.0,2022-11-11 13:58:16,0.0
32,32,32.0,Steel to Zero,"Hi All,

I have been meaning to post for a while, but I have been busy “focusing career” and family. Not much has changed other than the fact that I am even more bearish and probably can’t get any more bearish on the fundamentals of steel companies in North America for the next 6-12 months.

**Former Positions**

* In terms of trading I was long CLF puts in Sept and covered around $13 as the move was crazy fast and nothing to do with steel. I was long STLD shares as a hedge.
* I then went long NUE as it hit my bear valuation area at the time of $105. I rode it to 124.50 and also liquidated STLD (down slightly but amazing to come out even on a hedge). Per usual when I exit a long steel position it immediately rises another 10%.
* I made back the money I lost fucking up the Ukraine war and then some.

**Current Positions**

* Long CLF Mar 10 and 6 puts
* Long TX as a hedge and because it is the only thing that I see that looks cheap to me. Solid company that is consistently profitable and only trading at roughly 5x long run through cycle EPS, tons of cash, and little debt.
* I was long SNOW but sold when it went up 18% within 12 hours of my buying. I am looking to get back in on a dip. Although not relevant here, a main risk I see is the market melting up and tech might ironically be a nice hedge (it saved me today).

**My sources tell me that this is the worst market since 2009 for the following reasons:**

* Hot rolled and its derivative products as previously written are massively oversupplied as 7 million tons of new production are in the process of ramping up. U.S. Steel (X) has two blast furnaces sitting idle waiting to ramp back up if demand moves at all.
* Brazil imports will tick up a bit as the sanctions against them are now lifted. Also a reminder that Biden relaxed some of the tariffs on Europe, Japan.
* Steel Dynamics, Stelco, and Algoma have been running like crazy ruining the market while NUE and X have been more disciplined with ramping down production and idling mills.
* Market Millet was a bit spicy on his earnings call talking up how much better run Steel Dynamics is with high utilization. Although I believe Steel Dynamics is the best run steel company in North America, the utilization is partly high because he has been going to war and running full out! Lourenco on his call called out Millet and the Canadian producers for flooding the market and having zero discipline. I believe the gloves will come off and NUE, CLF, and X will start ramping up production like crazy and “go to war”. The oligopoly can go both ways it seems.
* All other products including downstream are now significantly weakening. Long bar and plate are weakening while fabrication probably has another 5-6 months of strength. Nucor has a new plate mill starting up soon.
* HRC and scrap have continued their downward march into the dirt for 7+ months
* Input costs such as zinc, energy are rising
* My ultra bear case for HRC would be a brief (10 weeks or less) period of $400 HRC and $150 scrap. This could happen if everybody is running like crazy during a recession while scrap crashes due to imports and the strong dollar. If this happens I look forward to getting massively long X, STLD, NUE, and maybe even CLF.

**Risks to steel equities trading up massively:**

* Market melt up
* China re-opening (actually bearish steel itself as they ramp up and export a shitload of steel)
* Europe/Ukraine need steel and not producing(mid 2023 or further, but China probably fills the void)
* M&A/investment activity
* onshoring(Western hemisphere, Europe)
* X strike (low risk now with a tentative agreement)
* 3 blast furnaces shut down quickly(Load up QUICKLY 100% CLF STLD NUE X Shares, exit puts). Doesn’t look like this is happening anytime soon.

* Previously written about massive oversupply and low demand
* China Trade War/ Taiwan blockaide: no chips no cars market crashes
* Brazil imports (minor)
* Market Meltdown
* Railroad strike
* Further contagion from shitcoins

**Valuations Below. Description of how I value steel and related equities:**

1. I determine the long run through cycle EPS per company. Usually something like 75% of 2024 EPS estimates. I do some massaging here
2. I come up with a high and a low multiple of this through cycle EPS. I base this on quality of the company/management, strength of the balance sheet, historical performance in up and down cycles, and taking care of the shareholders
3. I add in 50% of cash on hand. Not the same as net cash, but I want to favor companies who have cash and won’t need to dilute/issue debt in downturns and repair the balance sheet/buy back high priced shares in up cycles.
4. I capture the forward 12 months EPS and if it is higher than the long run through cycle EPS I add it in.
5. In bear markets I try to short at high or average valuation and buy at or below the low range valuation.
6. In bull markets I try to buy at the low or average valuation and sell at the high or a bit higher valuation

44,44,44.0,$TTD is expensive trash and it will show this earnings.,"Intro: The Trade Desk (TTD) is an American multinational technology company that specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users. All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.

1). Massive competition 

As stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.


2). The premium is too high

They have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can’t produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can’t produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.

3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads

We are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.
 
4). The guidance nail in the coffin

Guidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.

5). Bull thesis

This is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind 

7) TL;DR

$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.

8). Position.

I have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday. Yolo, food stamps or Ferraris lol.

46,46,46.0,TRADE IDEA: $RBLX PUTS THIS WEEK,"**$RBLX is setting up for a reversal in the weekly chart and has earnings this week.**

It’s currently at $40.58, I expect RBLX to hit $33.20 within the next 2 weeks.

I’ll explain my thesis, but before I explain… I know some of you will be talking sh\*t in the comments.

And I understand. I’d do the same thing if I didn't know any better…

**So, here are a few of my recent plays:**

**$DKNG:** Went long on OCT 25 at $13.91, sold NOV 1 for $16.34 for **17.47% profit in 7 days.**

**$CCJ:** Went short on OCT 10 at $26.23, closed the next day at $22.43. **14.49% profit in 1 day.**

**$UAL:** Went long on OCT 17 at $36.53, closed Oct 17 for $40.12. **9.83% profit in 2 days.**

**$GM:** Went long on Oct 17 at $33.42, still holding and up **17.71% after 19 days.**

If you want to see more evidence of my past trades, you can see my trade log which is in the link in my profile, or you can PM me, and I’ll send it to you.

Now that we got that out of the way, let’s talk about $RBLX:

My thesis is that $RBLX just SUCKS tbh.

Literally it SUCKS. It has to go down.

Nah, I’m kidding.

Here’s $RBLX 2 week chart.

https://preview.redd.it/mgmdm0d7ldy91.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=25c09341d415df62e3aec41da65459d30f8ca633

As you can see, the candle showing the last week is a shooter.

80% of the time this means that it’s going back down to the previous candle’s low.

That’s my thesis. And before any of you come at me with some BS - my track record speaks for itself.

**Earnings:**

If companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google all missed. What makes you think RBLX won't?

I could be wrong though, and the fact that this is an earnings play means I’m going in with small size.

**Entry:**

Don’t be dumb and enter the trade on Monday when the market opens.

RBLX has a support level on $39.55. If RBLX does not break that support level, you should **NOT ENTER** the trade until that support level is broken.

I like to look at the hourly chart.

If RBLX breaks that support level and confirms on the hourly chart, I’m going in.

“Confirms” means that you wait for an hourly candle to close below the support level.

**Warning**\*

Earnings play, go with small size.

48,48,48.0,"Apple is now valued more than Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined"," 

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

Hear me out. FuboTV is reporting earnings tomorrow morning. There's been an uptick on Google searches for Fubo in the past 3 months alongside increased searches in related topics of sports TV subscriptions:

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c60pfzx6&geo=US)

Compare this to Roku, which did not experience this search uptick. Roku also spent a lot of capital on physical Roku TVs, which the markets punished after its earnings yesterday. Fubo is unburdened by these types of capital expenditures.

* [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0\_x7l9\_](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0_x7l9_)

Currently, **short interest in FUBO is 24.95%**. With Fubo trading at all time lows, Fubo just has to not report terrible earnings and awful future projections (subscriptions by sports fans are quite resilient to recessions because it's an ""affordable luxury"") for the stock to rally. This domino can lead to a squeeze.

After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though.

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -> 365 -> 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -> 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right? 

Key support- 138.2 -> 135 -> 130

Key resistance- 142.2 -> 144.8

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow. 

Key support- 214.9 -> 210 -> 205.6

Key resistance- 219.3 -> 226.1

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

In particular, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 7.72%, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down 9.63% and Meta (META) suffers a brutal 24.56% drop following the latest earnings. Instead, there are some old companies more than 100 years old that are worth looking at as investors are looking for opportunities in quality “old” companies.

## 1. [EQT Corporation (EQT)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-EQT/)

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

## 2. [General Motors (GM)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-GM/)

General Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

So what is the problem with the above chart?

The FCF has been ERASED! The only big tech that has decided to smash its cash flow generation capacity. Zuck doesn't care. He is all in into the METAVERSE. F\* you shareholders. Investment returns? You should have bought APPLE.

That's why you see the following QoQ share price action in the same period (I have plotted 99$ in Sep 30, but it should be 27 Oct):

But hold on, what is all that cash burn rate? What is Zuckerberg doing with our cash?

Well he anounced the following:

&#x200B;

|Total Expenses|86|100|

100 F\*ing Billion per year! Hey Regards, he could be buying your entire GME company 12 times each of these 2 years. 

But... was this a SHHURPRISE? Mmm... no! This is what he already anounced last year, and the stock did a rally from 320$ to the 340$ after releasing this:

&#x200B;

[So still spending 10 Billiones below what he told us for FY2022](https://preview.redd.it/82o77zt30tw91.jpg?width=1560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97950cce7dfe04df98895f0b8e0ebf757d69e4ef)

The capital he will allocate in CAPEX will be 33-34 Bn$ each year, in 2022 and 2023. This is basically data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. As he says, ""increase in AI capacity""

So...

how is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.

The share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. 

OCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?

# Scalping Review

SPY opened at that 380 range and held (important level to hold as noted in last post). It started its first leg. It came back down to 380.96 at around 8:12 UTC-6 and tested 20 MA and AVWAP. It bounced and continued upward, completing another leg and half or so. For the next hour and half, SPY traded in a large flat top triangle - getting three bounces off the 385.04 line on the scalping chart. SPY broke out of the triangle at 10:15 UTC-6 and backtested twice. The 388.96 full measured move was hit EOD. SPY continued it’s uptrend and traded in a rectangle from 11:10 UTC-6 to 12:32 UTC-6. It broke out and hit 388.96 full measured move EOD. We closed right around 389.34 line on scalping chart.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks ended a volatile week with a sizable gain as Apple's earnings report boosted technology shares and a smattering of economic data suggested the Federal Reserve is making some progress in its battle against inflation.

  
The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 both posted their longest weekly gains since August. Gains in major technology companies such as Microsoft and Google Parent Alphabet aided both indexes in reversing a two-day decline.

  
Treasuries fell on Friday, snapping a three-day rally, as hopes of a Fed pivot faded. The dollar rose for the second day in a row.

  
This week, stocks, bonds, and the dollar swung wildly as investors tried to make sense of conflicting earnings reports and economic data.

  
Quarterly reports from megacap tech names underscored the impact of the Fed’s tightening regime, and consequently the surging dollar.

  
Meanwhile, a core measure of US inflation increased in September, strengthening the Fed's case for another jumbo rate hike next week. However, a contraction in manufacturing and services, as well as lower-than-expected US home sales, indicated that the Fed's actions were already having an impact on the economy. The release of gross domestic product data on Thursday temporarily allayed fears of a recession.

  
Economists continue to expect the Fed to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point next week, for the fourth time in a row. Rates are expected to rise another half point in December, followed by quarter point increases in the next two meetings.

73,73,73.0,Why META falls?,"Why META?

Another disappointed quarterly report. EPS missed estimate by 11.32%, net income and profit margin all down by 30+% from YoY. Without doubt, this is not a good time for META. In fact, not a good time for all tech firm.

Since beginning of the year, NASDAQ 100 index had down 30+%, FANG index which include major tech firm (as meta the representation of letter F) had down 40+%. Clearly the era of high flying tech stock has come to an end.

Some factors are obvious. Fed had increase Federal Target Fund rate dramatically, quantitative tightening is in place, simply, there is not enough cash on the market. Growth section got hurt the most because most company's stock price is based on potential, not company's fundamental, which in another word ""bubble"".

Tech giants are no different. Although in the past decade their business model works, plus under current accounting standard, tangible assets are really hard get a correct value. The result, every single quarterly report beat the estimate. Makes people tends to believe the further of these companies are unlimited.

But music has to stop. Fed can print as much cash as they want, but human can't make a baby in a blink of an eye. The problem for this growth model is that the number of consu[mers](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=mers&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A2733417712%7D) is a finite number, roughly 7billion at this point in case you don't know. After 20 ish years of crazy growth, each tech giant are approaching that limit.

The believe of unlimited growth is reaching to its end, in just 20 years. Some, like META has smaller cap number than others. As a SNS company, its max customer base is equal to people who use internet. So for META it is not 7B, it's actually 60% of world population about 4.2B. Right now, META's DAU is about 3B. Given that META is not available for all countries, it's actual potential customer cap is about 3\~3.5B.

With a predictable growth, the company's future is also predictable. Given that per customer profit is a steady number, people can easily guess how much money could META make in a time period. Plot those numbers in DCF model, you get a price on the end year. Since there is no surprises, there is no huge growth, thus, the price of the stock, is representing its true value, the future cash flow of the company.

But that is not the only problem META has, there is another threats, the competitor. Just like Nokia, the biggest mobile phone make during the 2000s, was not beaten by its opponent like Motorola, but an un-relative company, Apple. META has its own, ticktock, algorithm based content delivery network to be precise. The fundamental of SNS is to kill time, rarely it generate any value to its consumer. As long as people stick to your platform, you can feed in whatever you want to feed them. Most people without doubt, will take it.

This is an ideal places for ADs. The biggest problem for AD content is that you don't know who is your target audience. Traditional news papers, TVs, or radios don't have the granularity differentiate what does the audience like. In my point of view. Google and META had all worked on to solve one problem, how to let people wants to buy something know my product. The different is, while feed you with ADs, google is also providing you useful tools as the compensation use your personal data.

META however using a different approach. The longer you use the platform, more behavioral data will be generated to them, more precise ADs will deliver to you. And in return of use your privacy data, they feed you with more shit.

This works really well because people always need to pleasure themselves, and things generates dopamine are most welcome. So when a new platform which could generate more dopamine, and even more easier to use (you literally just has to swipe) had came out, people just gona to rush into it. The so called wide economy moat is gone fast.

This change the pricing logic for META. without customer data, it is worthless. Just like how people no longer read magazine. Another thing that accelerate this downfall, is Apple change privacy agreement. some easy to get data now META has to ask user permission, and for most people, the answer is fuck off.

The question right now is that given all kind of bearish factor, how much should META worth? For start, all the crazy gains during the pandemic should be no more, it just makes no sense. Secondly, META should be pricing as value stock, not a growth stock, it has no upward anymore. People may ask Metaverse Or Oculus, I just want to say, a product cost more than 400 bucks is either use too much tech or in a wrong direction. Just give me a break.

If you hold long enough, this should be somewhere at $100. I don't think the consumer base will lost that fast just as it not growing that fast. And that price range is conditioned on profit margin back to normal, however, the reality lab cost so much start letting investors lost hope with no idea when a major break-thought will be released.

75,75,75.0,Apple Q4 Earnings Preview: All Eyes On iPhone 14 Sales and Guidance,"[Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) will release Q4 earnings Thursday after the market. After several disappointing earnings posted by its FAAMG fellows (Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta), a weaker-than-expected quarterly result or guidance will further trigger stocks selling-off mode. 

Still, Apple’s current market cap is around $2.4 trillion, with PE 24.65. The stock is down 15.54% YTD, beating S&P 500’s -20%. 

**Here's what Wall Street expects:** 

revenue:  $88.68 billion, 6.4% Y/Y

diluted EPS: $1.26, up 2% Y/Y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/skr9qr5ddcw91.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=cff8e267d0a4159cd3db652d54791eba14f20868

Investors should mainly focus on the performance of U.S. and Chinese consumers, who contributed 45% and 18% company’s revenue in Q3. The iPhone 14 in other regions such as Europe and Japan saw price increases of 5%-20% compared to last generation due to unfavorable exchange rates and higher costs, however, prices for those two areas remained the same, probably for higher sales. 

**iPhone global market share increased further and the Pro series help driving ASP to a record high**

Wall Street expects iPhone Q4 revenue to be 42.66 billion, up 10% year-over-year, thanks to strong demand for iPhone 14 series. 

Research firm Canalys reported that global smartphone Q3 sales fell 9% year-on-year, recording third consecutive decline this year. However, Apple was the only vendor in the top five to record positive growth, improving its market share to 18% thanks to relatively resilient demand for iPhones, which includes latest iPhone 14 models.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/22viwg3edcw91.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=61d9418e2fad3def87e9abad9636cd4b5f255ef5

It is noted that iPhone 14 went on sale on September 16, a week earlier than 13 series, allowing Apple recorded roughly one-week sales into Q4 results. The initial demand will also set the tone for the December quarter covers the busy holiday shopping period, which typically achieves the highest revenue during the year. 

Consumers are more willing to buy costlier “Pro” models this time, due to huge improvement compared with 13 Pro Max (equip the latest A16 chip, the first ever 48 MP camera and dynamic island, etc). iPhone 14, the base model, got slight improvements from iPhone 13, but roughly the same price, which failed to capture consumers’ interests. 

Due to 14 Pro’s higher shipment proportion and prices, Counterpoint Research estimated that iPhone’s ASP (“Average Selling Prices”) will rise to a record $892 in the September quarter and $944 in the December quarter, higher than current record $873, achieved in the fourth quarter of last year.

But that also means iPhone's revenue will be mainly supported by two Pro models. And it also raises a question: can big demands for iPhone 14 Pro be sustainable throughout the next year?

Currently, if someone orders an iPhone 14 Pro 512G online in Los Angles, it will take at least 3-4 weeks, a week shorter compared with same period last month.

Apple hasn’t offered official guidance since 2020, and it may offer this time as well. Investors will be closely watching what Apple says about December quarter, the shopping season during the year. Any forecast or guidance that suggests lighter-than-expected results will be a risk to shares.  

**Will new** [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) **Watch and AirPods Pro help earnings this time?**

Wall Street expects Wearable devices, home and other products Q3 revenue of $ 8.79 billion, flat year-on-year. Accompanying with iPhone 14, Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE were both available on September 16, while Apple Watch Ultra and AirPods Pro II were available on September 23, which will be part of Q4 results as well. In addition, as iPhone 14 sells well, the accessories (cases, chargers) may also see some growth. However, analysts seem less bullish.

“We believe Wearables are the most discretionary product in Apple’s portfolio and therefore most prone to the pullback we are seeing in consumer electronics spending,” Morgan Stanley’s Woodring said in a note.

**Mac may be the shining star even PC demand slows sharply**

Wall Street expects Mac revenue for Q4 to reach $9.25 billion, flat Y/Y; iPad revenue will be $7.81 billion, down 5% Y/Y. 

It is noted that Mac revenue for Q3 fell 10% Y/Y and CEO Tim Cook attributed the drop to supply constraints, which means Apple couldn’t make enough computers to meet demand. Now, the supply constraints may not be a serious problem anymore, but demand is.

Declines continued for the traditional PC market as global shipments totaled 74.3 million units, down 15% Y/Y, during the third quarter of 2022, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Cooling demand and uneven supply have contributed to a year-over-year contraction of 15.0%.

""Consumer demand has remained muted though promotional activity from the likes of Apple and other players has helped soften the fall and reduce channel inventory by a couple weeks across the board,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers. ""Supply has also reacted to the new lows by reducing orders with Apple being the only exception as their third quarter supply increased to make up for lost orders stemming from the lockdowns in China during the second quarter.""

**Services revenue may slow further;** [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) **hiked music, TV+ fee first time ever**

In Q3, Apple's services revenue rose 12% year-over-year to $19.6 billion, the slowest growth rate since 2015, and is expected to slow further this time. Wall Street expects revenue to be $19.96 billion, up 10% year-over-year.

In July, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri warned investors that while services business would continue to expand, its growth rate would slow from 12% during the June quarter, citing the strong dollar and economic factors.

On Monday, Apple raised the prices of its Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple One in the United States, for the first time ever. Apple said the increase in Apple Music (Individual from $9.99 to $10.99 per month) subscription price was due to increased licensing costs. The company said artists and songwriters will earn more per stream as a result of the pricing tier changes. Regarding Apple TV+ (Individual from $14.95 to $16.95 per month), the company said the increased price reflects the growing catalog of original TV shows and movies. The price hiking may help services grow somehow (though not for Q4).

76,76,76.0,Gogoro $GGR is revealing its plans for India on Nov 3,"Gogoro is a battery swapping company for two wheelers which has accumulated over 500,000 customers in their BaaS network. Yearly revenue is around 400 million USD and almost fully coming from Taiwan market.

As a head up to all interested, they are on November 3 revealing their plans for India. As far as we know Gogoro is making co-operation with Indian company Hero Motocorp which is one of the largest two-wheeler manufacturers in the world and also with Foxconn which is world's largest technology manufacturer and service provider (which has indicated that they would like to build the battery swapping network in India preferably with Gogoro). The potential would be enormous in case they success with go to market.

[https://www.bikedekho.com/news/breaking-gogoro-to-reveal-plans-for-india-on-november-3-15259](https://www.bikedekho.com/news/breaking-gogoro-to-reveal-plans-for-india-on-november-3-15259)

Let's talk about the elephant in the room first. Taiwan and China relations are not the best at the moment. This is generating a substantion geopolitical risk for Gogoro. The ones who suspect that China will invade Taiwan anytime soon should stop reading at this point and skip to the next thread. However, the ones who think that China is far too busy with other topics at the moment than trying to invade Taiwan and risking their already poor economical performance with sanctions are free to check this opportunity out.

As a typical SPAC company Gogoro's journey in Nasdaq has been a bumpy ride down (with very low volume). In addition to overall SPAC sentiment, geopolitical risks, covid restrictions and challenges in first overseas expansion efforts in China the financial performance is relatively good. The company has a solid revenue stream, finance muscles for expansion and increasing userbase (sticky users who pay monthly subscriptions). There is room to grow in Taiwan (population 25 million) but main opportunity lies in countries like India, Indonesia and other south east asian countires with high scooter usage.

Gogoro's product is second to none in the market. In industry reviews Gogoro is in top position in battery swapping for two wheelers. I've been checking out multiple competitor products and my honest subjective opinion is that Gogoro simply seems to be the best. Marketing material etc. is top notch like Apple or Tesla for example. Other competitor's products looks like some garage engineering start ups :) As a clarification the main idea for Gogoro is to build battery swapping network so that other manufacturers could use the Powered By Gogoro Network (a bit like Android). They already have 10+ manufactures onboard.

Maybe the most serious competitor is Gachaco (I always need to Google the name as I can't remember it). It's based on Honda's technology and looks pretty decent. There are also plenty of companies planning to build a scooter based on that product. However, just by checking the product and marketing material I'm not fully convinced. Compared to Gogoro there are additional steps when switching the batteries and the overall marketing material isn't so good and appealing to public (my personal opinion). They have launced small pilots in Japan and India but there obviously seems to be a very long road ahead of them to improve their product and there surely is lot to catch up with Gogoro which has around 10 years experience of finetuning the product and services (AI etc.). Also even if the Gachaco would grow their market share then there still is a room for couple of players. It is also nice to know that scooters can have multiple battery variations as for example Yamaha has scooters in Taiwan which are based on Gogoro technology.

CEO Horace Luke who has background in innovating Xbox and succesfully launcing HMD phones in the past is very capable guy. He has a passion to sustainability and no suprise he was the one who initiated battery swapping for two wheelers in the first place by inventing the products. Btw, his name is in many of the patents so really this guy knows what he is doing and is really hands in the sand guy with can do attitude.

No doubt Gogoro is a risky bet but the potential is also enormous. In a long run two wheeler's sustainability topic in big cities has to be addressed in a one way or another and battery swapping sounds much more practical than hundreds of millions of individual users charging with wires. Gogoro might or might not be the rainmaker in the industry in the next decade but it has a good chance. Successful India expansion would surely ensure a payday for all $GGR investors (especially for the ones who have loaded up shares with $3 prices). For the ones who prefer less risk then it might be good idea to follow up the financial performance for some time as you can always jump on board a bit later.

I own plenty of Gogoro shares and I'm willing to take the risk at this point. However, I'm not a financial advisor so make your own dd :)",yepjnp,8.0,13.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yepjnp/gogoro_ggr_is_revealing_its_plans_for_india_on/,1666870330.0,2022-10-27 07:32:10,-1.0

 Consumer confidence reports came out yesterday.

 The Consumer Confidence Survey reflects the prevailing trading conditions and likely developments for the coming months.

 This monthly report details consumer attitudes, purchase intentions, vacation plans, and consumer expectations regarding inflation, stock prices and interest rates. 

Data is available for age, income, 9 regions and top 8 states. It is a number that fluctuates based on responses to monthly surveys. 

The reference level of 100 is based on readings in 1985. From the graph below we can finally see a decline.

 A decline to 102.5 higher than the expected 106.5.

 Although the levels are still very high this represents a step forward which shows that the Fed's monetary policies are working well.

85,85,85.0,Alphabet misses on earnings as YouTube shrinks; company will cut headcount growth by half in Q4,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/alphabet-googl-q3-2022-earnings-.html

Alphabet

shares dropped about 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for the third quarter and said it would significantly decrease headcount growth.

    Earnings per share (EPS): $1.06 vs. $1.25 expected, according to Refinitiv estimates.
    Revenue: $69.09 billion vs. $70.58 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates.
    YouTube advertising revenue: $7.07 billion vs $7.42 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.
    Google Cloud revenue: $6.9 billion vs $6.69 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates
    Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $11.83 vs $12.38 expected, according to StreetAccount estimates

Revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41% a year earlier as the company contends with a continued downdraft in online ad spending. Other than one period early in the pandemic, it’s the weakest period for growth since 2013.

YouTube ad revenue slid about 2% to $7.07 billion from $7.21 billion a year ago. Analysts were expecting an increase of about 3%. Alphabet reported overall advertising revenue of $54.48 billion during the quarter, up slightly from the prior year.

Philipp Schindler, chief business officer for Google, said the company saw a pullback in spend on search ads from certain areas such as insurance, loans, mortgage and cryptocurrencies.

The report marks an ominous start to Big Tech earnings week for investors focused on the digital ad market. Last week, Snap issued disappointing results and said it was unable to provide a forecast given the volatility in spending and concerns about the economy. Snap plummeted 28% on Friday following the numbers. Meta
is scheduled to report results on Wednesday, and analysts are expecting a second straight quarter of declining revenue.

Alphabet’s stock fell below $97 after hours. Its lowest close for the year was $95.65 on Sept. 30. Prior to the after-hours drop, Alphabet shares are down 28% over the past year, slightly underperforming the Nasdaq.

Meta shares fell 4% in extended trading on Tuesday after rallying 6% during the day.

Alphabet’s top executives referenced the challenges the company faces at the top of Tuesday’s earnings release. CEO Sundar Pichai said in the statement that the company is “sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities,” while Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said “we’re working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.”

During the quarter, Google Cloud brought in $6.9 billion — more than analysts expected. That’s a notable increase from $5 billion the year prior. Losses in Google Cloud widened to $699 million from $644 million the year prior.

Pichai enacted some cost-cutting measures across the company, citing economic challenges, including a potential recession, soaring inflation, rising interest rates and tempered ad spending. In September, Pichai said he wanted to make the company 20% more efficient, which could include slashing jobs and product cuts.

Google also canceled the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and cut funding to its Area 120 in-house incubator. And last month, Google said it would be shuttering its digital gaming service Stadia.

The company said it has a total full-time worker headcount of 186,779 — up from 150,028 last year. Pichai said on Tuesday’s call that the fourth-quarter headcount additions will be “significantly lower” than the third quarter as the company becomes “focused on moderating operating expense growth.”

“Our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023,” Pichai said, reiterating comments from the second-quarter call. “Talent is the most precious resource,” he said.

Porat said that in the fourth quarter, “headcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3.”",ydsiuo,8.0,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ydsiuo/alphabet_misses_on_earnings_as_youtube_shrinks/,1666772046.0,2022-10-26 04:14:06,0.0

97,97,97.0,Key Takeaways from Dodd-Frank Bank Liquidity Stress Test,"Hi Friends, parts of my previous post got deleted for some reason, so I will repost my key takeaways of my previous post here.

&#x200B;

Key Take Aways

>!1) Each bank performs several rounds of midcycle statistical analysis corroborated by the Federal Reserve on how well its portfolio will perform against financial markets during prolong periods of shrinking on the economy. !<

>!2) The TLDR, also known as the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, is also known as the bank's ratio of debt to assets. !<

>!3) Due to an accounting quirk, a bank considers things like loans and interest assets (in addition to stock and fixed income securities), while guaranteed customer deposits are considered debt. !<

>!4) The true leverage a bank has is 1/TLDR!<

>!5) Based on experiences trading currency futures (forex), cryptocurrency futures, and stock index futures, many understand that when a portfolio's true leverage increases, it increases potential returns. Risk however also increases. !<

>!6) The drawdown percentage is also known as a decline in value of assets held in a bank's portfolio.!<

>!7) A bank will have tell you  what period the report is good for.  It will have the anticipated change in leverage and change in assets drawdown.!<

>!8) You can find a bank's dfast report by googling '\[bank name\] \[year\] midcycle dfast report'!<

&#x200B;

How to Apply This To Earnings

>!1) A bank will experience solid earnings price action if anticipated leverage increases and drawdown % decreases throughout the period that the dfast report is guiding. !<

>!2) A bank will experience muted earnings if anticipated leverage increases slightly and drawdown % decreases slightly.!<

>!3) A bank will also experience muted earnings if outdated dfast report is promptly addressed with brief, timely update. !<

>!4) A bank will forfeit any earnings gains and experience downward price action if the anticipated leverage increases and drawdown significantly increases. !<

>!5) A bank will also forfeit any earnings gains and experience downward price action if it refuses to publicly update on most recent dfast results. !<

&#x200B;

How to benefit from this through options

>!1) Category 4 banks will finalize all earnings price action premarket on the day after earnings are released. It is best to place bets on the stock before the earnings release. !<

>!Category 4 banks include Ally Financial, American Express, BMO Financial, BNP Paribas USA, Citizens Financial Group, Inc, Discover Financial Services, Fifth Third Bancorp, HSBC North America Holdings Inc, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, KeyCorp Inc, M&T Bank Corporation, MUFG Americas Holdings Corporation, RBC US Group Holdings LLC, Regions Financial Corporation, and Santander Bank. !<

>!2) Category 3 banks will finalize all earnings price action during market open. It is best to place bets on the stock after earnings release. !<

>!Category 3 banks include Barclays US LLC, Capital One Financial Corporation, The Charles Schwab Corporation, Credit Suisse Holdings (USA), Inc, Deuschle Bank USA, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, TD Group US Holdings LLC, Truist Financial Corporation, UBS Americas Holding LLC, and U.S. Bancorp  !<

>!3) Category 1 banks will finalize all earnings price action during noon. The stock may be trading higher from good earnings only to suddenly reverse in the middle of the day. Getting in and out of put contracts midday requires critical timing. !<

>!Category 1 banks include Bank of America Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, Citigroup Inc, The Goldman Sachs Group, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo. !<

&#x200B;

I put spoilers so that the work won't get lost :)

I also said that banks that refuse to update dfast results automatically forefeit earnings price gains.

Discover Financial is one of the banks that refuses to update dfast results, and will suffer during earnings today afterhours.",yckj9o,8.0,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yckj9o/key_takeaways_from_doddfrank_bank_liquidity/,1666640422.0,2022-10-24 15:40:22,-1.0
98,98,98.0,MVIS - Lasers are the future and the future is NOW!!,"Early birds catch the juiciest worms!

Its Monday cocksuckers.. And lady cocksuckers. And boy do I have a spicy one for you today...   Lasers BITCH!
 
April 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB and all the hype of a potential MSFT buyout, we all know how that went, but fuck you that's not the point. Fast forward 18 months and it’s clear that the price action in April 2021 was just an amuse bouchée for what will happen next.

Developments since April 2021 include:
Mavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It’s getting worse by the week as daily we are seeing trading largely Algo driven as with a lot of the market, liquidity is drying up and shorts are passing blocks between themselves to drive the price down. Some wrinkle brains with actual knowledge of how the market works have counts in the range of 100million shares short total on MVIS, a big difference from the 24% currently reported. Average short volume for the past 30 days is a whopping 70.36% with off exchange volume for the past 30 days touching 34.08%. Given many stocks are highly shorted right now I don't want to hear any slabbering, I know this shit man, but with a product as delicious as MAVIN Dr just being trademarked, and the fact they provided the light engine which made the Hololens 2 possible, and lets face it, if MSFT are using MVIS for the Hololens 2 they sure as hell are using it for the IVAS which secured MSFT that ball tingling $22bili contract with the US military. This is a ticking time bomb ready to fuck any short brave enough to touch it. Hiya Kenny.
 
MVIS have a cash runway for 2 years. They have negligible debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. Which given the state of the world right now is a golden arrow in their quiver, many of these competitors aren't likely to make it to production without seriously diluting their shareholders... I'm looking at you Omer(INVZ CEO for those unaware) who on the 29th of September announced Mixed shelf registration for up to $200million... CEO claims they don't need it but have done so for ""good business practices"".... Check his twitter comments stating such. I call bullshit, enough said.

MVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. 
MVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an “OEM friendly” white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor. Which the company has filed trademark registration for on 10/11/2022 https://uspto.report/TM/97628161 notice the smaller form factor compared to the original postings on linkedIn 
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/microvision_autosens-automotivelidar-activity-6975685318729490432-Hy3B?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

Now the company has stated the form factor will get smaller when ASIC is completed... Is this the final smaller form or will we see another size decrease... We can only speculate for now..

Mavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. This has been tested and demonstrated to Some OEM (it hasn't been declared who) in Germany where the company has Offices set up as of last year... Someone wants MVIS in Germany...

Mavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. 

Mavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.

Mavin is available to OEMs via the NVDA platform.
MVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&A. Feeling like Pac-Man munching up these dots.. Nom, Nom, Nom. 

MVIS currently has 3 vacancies for ASIC design engineers https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/
To which the CEO Sumit Sharma stated last year that it is not cost effective to design an ASIC unless they have secured orders for 1.2-1.5 million units... What does that tell you???

Sumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! Listen. Some clampets out there are stating that such a certification is capable of being self-certed.. to which I respond... Why the delay then bitch??? Because just like everything in this shitshow of a world since Covid, THERE ARE DELAYS.

MVIS said in the Jan 2022 investor slides that they would be ready for partnerships this year. Now that Class 1 certification has been achieved, MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! To which Sample sales have already started and are being shipped off to the big knobs with fat ass check books as we speak...

Single Unit - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/3.jpg
5 Unit case - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/4.jpg
Talk about classy..

MVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July’s earnings call. Now they have the class 1 certification, those orders have been shipped. They quoted one OEM as saying “Mavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen”. Sumit’s character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. Now, when I say Sumit is a humble man I certainly believe that to be the case, he is an engineer, so he gets rightfully excited when talking about the product and what the company has achieved with such, and in my opinion has no need to be a boisterous character like we see in some of the competitors, *cough* Austin Russell *cough* which tells me a lot about the company and the product they are offering...
 
The MVIS executive bonus scheme was launched this summer and it rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36. Todays opening price was $3.49. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! The tiered executive bonus scheme is organised as such that management doesn't get awarded shares unless the share price reaches the thresholds and stays there for 20 days. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. This is the real deal, and will make you enough money to finally move your way up from sleeping at the bottom of your wife and her many boyfriends bed.   

Their investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market. 

They have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  

In January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That’s a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple deals are expected to be signed over the next 9-10 months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. 

In addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which as previously mentioned only exists because of MVIS tech! 

https://youtu.be/OmiQvjQuFqQ

Done so by a very fine Redditor who took it upon himself after countless hours or research following patents etc to prove once and for all that MVIS are the dogs balls and have the tech so well patented and perfected that the biggest, baddest tech companies in the world cannot make this tech as good as this for themselves. Hiya Meta and APPL. Now MSFT had MVIS by the balls when this deal was struck as the company could well have been facing bankruptcy if it wasn't for the savage group of investors who put so much into this company, they staved off the relentless shorting and helped bring about the savage short squeeze we seen in April 2021.... This company has made so many people life changing amounts of money... But guess what, they ain't fucking done yet. People still buying shares when its right for them as they know the life changing money they have already made will be made again...   

Many AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. 
Then factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, and no one is selling. We all know what we own. 
It’s going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price.  There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  it’s inevitable.

Oh yeah EC is this Thursday.. Not expecting any mind blowing or even significant revenue changes, anyone expecting such will be sorely disappointed, but that is not the point. The business updates and hearing the confidence in managements statements is enough to get you harder than a couple little blue boys and your Mrs standing with a big red dildo to fuck you harder than the market has this year.

Listen, I could post DD for days on this company but you degenerate fucks are probably only going to read the TLDR and tell me to ""short squeeze these nuts"" (Fuck you Automod) buy shares, LEAPs if you must, but do not play into the MMs hand by buying weeklies or I'm going to come fuck you myself.

TLDR; this is in my opinion the most highly researched company on the market, the DD is phenomenal, and the company has the meat to follow. They cannot make a move without retail hot on their tail... And management KNOW THIS... Fuck the shorts, lasers are the future and MVIS knows lasers better than anyone.  PEW PEW

P.s THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY, although, the fact it is so highly shorted is just some extra fuel for when a deal is announced i'm telling you now so you have a chance to get in not far off what has so far been the bottom... What happens between now and a deal being announced is anyone's guess, but this is a damn good place to join the roller-coaster.

99,99,99.0,5 Valuation Models for Last Week's Earnings Releases,"Hey guys, I gathered 5 stocks from last week's earnings and updated their models. 

I'm going to post them below, and you can copy/tweak the models to reflect how you see the companies.

## [Netflix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8FTR1LIa-faPoo8oUJjMJVRsR5Uezo93lasVBxX5CI/edit#gid=1709167660) Est. Value at $78.5 Billion

Even with the encouraging earnings result, Netflix seems to be 64% overvalued, with an estimated value per share of $176.3.

https://preview.redd.it/2prmahqwsrv91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=faf0eb6d7e42fcc7a28c74743aae827340a6001e

## [Johnson & Johnson](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hvoEV_VmFaQSFUH1ExaRxFL8UGWGw4YYGmPkFahuUO8/copy#gid=1709167660) Est. Value At $292 Billion

J&J seems to be ahead of its intrinsic value by 52%. The company is growing in nominal terms, but value may be degraded by inflation and future taxes.

https://preview.redd.it/izh3bj7ysrv91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b6508267a9a9d1ed41a4dff9ba7d1beb4b19b32

## [Lam Research Corp.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tofm0k4TkG0RB-vZfIcOWXHbwA7KlBvkkY1deiqrjNQ/copy#gid=1709167660) Est. Value at $63.4 Billion

The company seems to be 21% undervalued, with an est. 1-year price target at $510 per share. Lam may be impacted by recent changes in Western to China relations, which could by what is keeping the price depressed.

Investors may benefit by trying to predict whether this situation will eventually improve or keep deteriorating.

https://preview.redd.it/98uejxmzsrv91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=88d6f479401b4328f83c2057d2cd1c63fcf19e47

## [AT&T Inc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oyumEO6CU_RCL9YRY3L4Do3R91_xsrUNmJndceZNR4/copy#gid=1709167660) Est. Value at 111.2 Billion

The company is trading within 10% of its estimated intrinsic value. The major risk driver is the debt burden, which is made worse by rising interest rates.

https://preview.redd.it/lxplwk81trv91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd0b15f7dd8111802d23ebfa9537050edb0ab1e

## [Verizon Communications Inc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JN9W7Fe1IFouTMWHkMDOhoI15tB1SWOHTyivmMwoPBk/copy?usp=sharing) Value at $155.4 Billion

Verizon seems to be trading around its intrinsic value, with the highest factor depressing the price being the current cost of debt. The company has $174 billion in debt, and close to 60% of the future free cash flows are expected to go towards servicing that debt.

https://preview.redd.it/7eichsj3trv91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bba928f691ae84a076e3ae02407fedd979c3d3f

\[1\] - The adapter cracked but not melted. Card still works. I put it on the list for overabundance of caution

\[2\] - The quality of the image is low and doesn't seem to be any sign of melting but it seems there's some sign of discoloration. Card still works.

\[3\] - Based on the supplied images, the adapter does not seem to be melting but there's some thinning on the outer edge.

\[4\] - Based on the supplied image, this looks to be more of a physical damage vs thermal melting problem.

\[5\] - Based on the 2 supplied images, there seems to be a chipped damage on one of the pin as well as some sign of discoloration

* Just keeping everyone updated: Out of about 130 emails so far to the 4090cable inbox, we've received 7 that are 150V rated wires (and therefore potentially indicative of different supply), so 5%. That rating doesn't instantly mean it's bad. Replying to a few for info
* And to be really, really clear so people don't panic: Again, we have no evidence presently to suggest 150V cables are instantly bad. All that means is they're the same as what Igor showed - we assume older supply, but not sure. We're trying to get some for testing.
* The spec on the wire really just tells us that the supply is not the correct supply for that wire component. It's supposed to be 300V spec at 105C / 14AWG.
* Also, we're noticing a trend (could be limited sample size, not enough to know) of Zotac cards using this type of cable.
   * **Clarification**: Thanks, should have made it clearer with the vague reference. We don't know what Zotac is using at large. We know that most of the 7 150V ones we've received emails about are Zotac. I think 1-2 are Gigabyte.
* Oh, one other note - of the 130, not that many are actually burned. Still going through everything, but it's below 10 for sure. Several of the ones from reddit are not in our inbox, as they likely already had the cable replaced.

Summary:

* Igor's Labs cable showing 150v spec wire
* All 5x GN adapters show 300v 14AWG 105C on 12v/GND (28 AWG for sense lines)
* GN asked partners and manufacturers and the adapters are supposed to be like the 5 adapters GN has
* GN disagreed with Igor's analysis on the construction quality of the adapter based on the 5 adapters they have
* GN believes Igor's cable is a red herring and ultimately a ""different cable"" than what they own.
* GN noticed different soldering method between their cables and Igor's cable (larger/thicker 2 points on GN vs smaller/thinner 4 points on Igor's)
* GN cables do not snap as easily as Igor's
* \[Editor's Note\] GN is not saying Igor is wrong. GN is saying that Igor has a different adapter than what they own. Igor's conclusion comes from the adapter that he owns.

* The problem is not the 12VHPWR connection as such, nor the repeated plugging or unplugging.
* Standard compliant power supply cables from brand manufacturers are NOT affected by this so far.
* The current trigger is NVIDIA’s own adapter to 4x 8-pin in the accessories, whose inferior quality can lead to failures and has already caused damage in single cases.
* Splitting each of the four 14AWG leads onto each of the 6 pins in the 12VHPWR connector of the adapter by soldering them onto bridges that are much too thin is dangerous because the ends of the leads can break off at the solder joint (e.g., when kinked or bent several times).
* Bending or kinking the wires directly at the connector of the adapter puts too much pressure on the solder joints and bridges, so that they can break off.
* The inner bridge between the pins is too thin (resulting cross section) to compensate the current flow on two or three instead of four connected 12V lines.
* NVIDIA has already been informed in advance and the data and pictures were also provided by be quiet! directly to the R&amp;D department.

In after hours it even drops 20%, taking to the prices it traded in January 2016. According to data from GuruFocus, the company is considered significantly undervalued as can be seen from the graph below.

In general, growth companies at this time suffer greatly from both a lack of liquidity and the fact that they are priced in relation to future cash flows.

With bond yields skyrocketing, it's more profitable to pocket the coupon of a bond than invest in a stock that hardly pays dividends. 

On the macro front, GDP data will be released today: hopefully the umpteenth bad news is that the GDP is worse than expected to avoid further tightening by the FED.

117,117,120.0,"10-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well today was one wild day that’s for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a “level to level” play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren’t stopping out too soon (this is why I didn’t chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key support- 381.6 -> 378.9 -> 378 -> 374.3

Key resistance- 385 -> 388.6 -> 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple…. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking.

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough.

You know those little maps that say “you are here” when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak… apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover… its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -> 3805 -> 3770

Key resistance- 3875 -> 3925

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn’t very bullish… 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing… technically Tesla beat but missed revenue… its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before… But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don’t know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -> 147.3 -> 145.5

Key resistance- 150.9 -> 152.4

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today… So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -> 214.4 -> 209.9 -> 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -> 229.5 -> 234

As if the VIX couldn’t become anymore detached from reality… we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers… however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That’s really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn’t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it’s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

119,119,122.0,FAANG + Microsoft are all still a genuinely attractive buy to me,"Long story short I’m finding these 6 stocks to be very attractive currently for the following reasons: 

1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.

2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don’t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they’re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.

3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. 

I feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. 

Re: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they’re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. 

Hence, I feel there’s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind. They might get killed over the next 1-2-3 whatever years but I find them to offer solid and reliable value.

In Europe, on the other hand, another hike in ECB interest rates of 0.75 points (Thursday) is expected, while the Dutch TTF ( european [$NATGAS](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/natgas) ) drops 10%, reaching -70% from its highs. If we have good news it is likely that the technical rebound that started last week can continue but until we have some encouraging inflation data we will continue to be in a bear market. 

The most important thing is to reduce core inflation which is heavily influenced by the housing market. It is usually always the last to surrender.

126,126,130.0,"In my early 20s, need some advice","I've just recently finished university and working full time now. In 2021 to early part of 2022, I had around 10k saved from the previous 4 years working internships and summer jobs, and I started investing during that time and as many others, I lost legit all of it.   


For a long time, almost all of 2022, I just didn't even want to look at any of this anymore, was so burnt out. But now I've started work full time and I have money I should be looking to invest, and I think it's a good time to do so for my future.  


Currently, I have around 15k I can invest and per month I can squeeze out around 500 to continuously invest.  


I want to have a fresh start, and this time make some more smarter decisions. I've spent some time to compile a list of companies from different sectors I could star to look into which maybe good opportunities:

**TECH**:  
GOOG  
FB  
MSFT  
APPL  
TSLA  
NVDA  
Amd  
Shop  
Snap

**Consumer Goods**  
PG  
WMT  
ACI  
MCD  
JNJ  
NKE

**Finance and Banking**  
V  
MA  
TD / BMO / RY (Canadian Banks)

**ETFs**  
QQQ  
FNGU  
ARKF  
XEQT  


**Others**  
BRK-B  
TSM  
Nio  
Sofi  
Upst  
Afrm  
TDOC  


Now, I'm still young in my early 20s, so I can still tolerate some risk. I want to set aside a few selected choices from the above for long term (10-15 years) but more so look to take more risks with the next 3-5 years in mind.

I'd really appreciate advice you guys would have as to how I should allocate my money, and from the above what should I choose and focus on (and anything else you may think is better, I know I'm totally missing any Energy, don't much about it)

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It’s important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It’s do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in [a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653?mod=article_inline)from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN).com Inc., [Meta Platforms](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META) Inc.’s Facebook, [Alphabet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG) Inc.’s Google, [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) Corp. and [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) Corp.

Historically speaking, money spent on advertising dollars has taken a hit after a recession. From the table above you can see money spent on ads dropped after the dot com bubble burst, the 08’ housing market burst, and then most recently 2020 covid crash.

I believe this recession is going to be nasty as it’s the first of it’s kind in which the FED’s are raising rates, inflation is still high, and housing is…. well, stupidly high – rent and cost.

[Weekly $TTD chart](https://preview.redd.it/dwlefsmbi1r91.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=36cf5e57073a27f7919202936c305704efec5da9)

Above is a $TTD weekly chart. You can notice that from March 2020 – December 2020 the stock continues to climb an amazingly 525%.. 

[Measuring the 525&#37; climb since \\""Rescue Plan\\""](https://preview.redd.it/wsquslwli1r91.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=421a30253af9af66f38121dfa951250debf7e5e7)

What else was introduced in March? A $1.9 trillion stimulus package called the “American Rescue Plan”. Business’s got relief and spent money on advertising to try to attract more business, as anyone in that situation would have done. 

With rising rates, a strong dollar which affects international spending, inflation, and companies left and right lowering guidance. I can’t help but think that $TTD has yet to be hit from some reduced spending. The charts also indicate that $TTD is in a downtrend. 

$TTD also trades at a stupid high P/E compared to the other publicly traded ad business’s ($CCO, $OMC, $GOOG, $IPG) 

They do have an investor day October 4th, so I expect a little bit of a bounce after that, so good opportunity to add to my current position. 

Would like to hear opinions or reasons why I am thinking incorrectly about this. I have strong conviction and will be adding more.

Even if it drops more from here you are getting a great price for it, I wouldn't pass this up...

Google is now trading for a 16x forward earnings and 11x EBITDA. Its not as sensitive to supply chain issues and inflation as other companies are. Google is literally the internet and not going anywhere and is a huge monopoly with no competitors even dreaming of coming close. It is also extremely oversold with an RSI below 30 and at 52 week lows. This is one of those All-In opportunities that you can feel proud of and brag to your dads boyfriend about.

Again... We are talking about freaking Google here, everyone uses Google and Google uses everyone. I  have been loading shares under $100. Anyways this is my opinion and not my financial advise yada yada

165,165,169.0,To all the Shills out there saying GME can't happen again. You're welcome,"I'm assuming you were too young at the time or maybe forgot since humans clearly forget shit all the time, especially when it goes against their thinking.

Do you all not remember the famous **Volkswagen** (**VW**) squeeze of 2008? Shit went ballistic and **gained like 400%+ in 2 days**. VW became the world's #1 most valuable company for a short time during the squeeze. ***(Estimations shorts lost almost $40 billion.)***

**-** **HerbalLife** **(HLF)** got squeezed when Ackman and Icahn duked it out....Icahn won and walked away +$1billion, ***Ackman covered for double his entry, so figure out that loss*** LMAO.

**-** **Tesla** **(TSLA)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $40 Billion in 2020)*** \- *I don't need to hear about how great TSLA is*. TSLA was **THE MOST** heavily shorted stock in the world in mid 2020. How do you think it's so fucking high in value and went ballistic and 10x in less than 1 year? Now its gone literally nowhere for almost 2 years. The shorts getting fucked hard had a LOT to do with TSLA epic 2020 run. Cherry picking here, from Jan '21 to now, TSLA is about even, maybe slightly down -2%. 600 days later, a shit ton of sales and growth, new models, new factories, etc and other good shit, and its gone nowhere because people learned to fear shorting TSLA.

**-** **Gamestop** **(GME)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $20 billion)*** needs no introduction but it was $4 pre-split and in pre-split terms went to $400+ and still sitting at pre-split $120 and about pre-split $200 a month ago. You're telling me GME went from $4 to $120-$200 range because RC is turning it around with NFTs no one gives a fuck about anytime soon? What's his play, sell video games online? Platforms already do that. Or let me guess, going to offer everyone 1 penny for their trade-ins instead of 2 pennies? LMFAO...What moat does GME have that any Megacap like GOOG, META, AMZN, MSFT, etc etc can't copy or do better? Fuck it, Netflix probably has more customers and a better chance selling NFTs than GME LMFAO. Even dare I say Robinhood could probably do it better.

**Shit does not need to make sense nor be rational.** If your argument against BBBY going to $30, $50, $100, or $500 is the ""value"" of BBBY isn't worth that much and that is an irrational price target, then you are completely mistaken and don't understand how the market works. BBBY could become the world's most valuable company this week if there were enough shorts getting their nuts squeezed off. Of course, this is completely irrational and beyond unrealistic but you get my point.

Now I know everyone is expecting some epic news release tomorrow and the price to rip to $30 but that isn't going to happen. Stop being dumb and unrealistic. Strategic news is not some magical saving grace and automatic doubling of revenue everyone dreams about. The news will 100% give the shorts a reason to attack the fuck out of the stock and since everyone is impatient and a little paper-handed bitch, BBBY WILL drop like a MOFO tomorrow. Stop being little bitches and hold your panties up with those diamond hands. Don't drop 'em for the hedgies. **Stop Losses are for losers!**

Shills, let's see you change my mind...

**TLDR: Stocks have been squeezed crazy high for ages. Let me repeat to you extra regarded apes in the back. SQUEEZED FOR FUCKING AGES with billllllions in losses.

\*\*\*\*\* EDIT FOR ALL THE EXTRA SHILLY ONES OUT THERE WHO ARE 100% CONFIDENT BBBY = DEATH: \*\*\*\*\**Please excuse my rounding below. The numbers are perfect but fairly close to make my point.*

$4 --> $160      *(+3800% or so)*  
$160 --> $60   **(-62%. It's definitely dead and done. Was fun while it lasted)**  
*But wait, there's more!*  
$60 --> $500    *(another +700-800% or so run)*  
$500 --> $39   **(-92%. Okay, NOW it's safe to say it, definitely 100% without a doubt D.E.A.D. Nothing can come back from -92%)**  
*Think again mothafuckas!*  
$40 --> $180    *(yet ANOTHER +400% rip over 2 days. That was quick)*  
$180 --> $85    **(-56%, 3rd time is a charm. Never again will this shit see a price above $100 or I'll eat a monkey dick. That last one was a fluke.)**  
$85 --> $340    *(ANNNNNND ANOTHER +300% moonshot. Thank you sir, may a have another?)*

Zoom Video Communications Inc. is struggling to convince people to pay for its videoconferencing service in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a trimmed forecast and falling stock price Monday.

Zoom ZM, -2.07% executives reduced their earnings and revenue guidance for the fiscal year Monday afternoon, and Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg blamed a stronger U.S. dollar — a problem many global tech companies have called out in recent earnings reports — but also a decline in “the online business,” or the more casual Zoom user.

“Our revenue was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, performance of the online business, and to a lesser extent sales weighted to the back end of the quarter,” Steckelberg said in a statement included with the results.

In an interview with MarketWatch and a conference call Monday afternoon, Steckelberg acknowledged that individuals and small businesses have changed their habits. Many aren’t flocking to the service as often or for as long as they did during the peak of the pandemic, when many Americans were working almost exclusively from home and socializing with friends over the service. An increase in one-on-one meetups, vacations and hybrid work schedules have altered the post-pandemic business cycle for Zoom, executives acknowledge, and getting users to pay is harder.

“The big challenge is new customer additions,” she said.

Zoom recently installed a 40-minute limit on users with a Basic, or free, subscription, which Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said could be a way to push more users to become paying subscribers. Steckelberg told MarketWatch that the time cap has had a “significantly positive impact” so far, but admitted in the conference call it was “not enough to overcome the macro dynamics.”

The news wasn’t all bad — Zoom’s enterprise business, which sells subscriptions to larger organizations, grew 27% to $599 million. Enterprise customers improved 18% to 204,100 over the past year through contracts with UCLA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -7.43% and others, as well as longer deals. Zoom Phone licenses hit a record of nearly 4 million, up more than 100% year-over-year.

“It was a mixed quarter, with enterprise proving to be strong,” Steckelberg told MarketWatch.

The ongoing friction between employees who wish to continue to work from home and employers like Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.30%, Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -2.53% GOOG, -2.58% Google and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META, -2.92% — all of whom are sitting on acres of unused commercial real estate and asking workers to come in at least twice a week — could have a profound impact on Zoom. A group of Apple employees on Monday launched a petition asking CEO Tim Cook for a more flexible work policy.

The company also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.94%, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -2.03%, Google and many other corners.

M Science’s software analyst Charles Rogers believes users aren’t jumping to other platforms, but cutting the service because of inflation and more relaxed pandemic guidelines. He also saw more worrisome results internationally than in the U.S., with a second consecutive quarterly decline in the European region and sequentially flat sales in the Asia Pacific quadrant.

Zoom posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $45.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, up from $1.02 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Zoom reported earnings of $1.05 a share, down from $1.36 a share last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 94 cents a share on revenue of $1.12 billion.

Zoom executives said they now expect full-year adjusted earnings of $3.66 to $3.69 a share on revenue of roughly $4.39 billion, down from $3.70 to $3.77 a share on sales of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion. For the third quarter, they expect 82 to 83 cents a share on revenue of about $1.1 billion, while analysts on average had been projecting 92 cents a share on sales of $1.15 billion, according to FactSet.

Zoom shares declined nearly 9% in after-hours trading following release of the results, after closing with a 2.1% decline at $97.44. Zoom’s stock is down 47% so far in 2022.

That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years.

He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a façade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** 

&#x200B;

Enough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, ""but that's another topic"" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**

**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally.

VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost.

The usual websites to show this data that are free are Yahoo Finance and Finviz.

Well, both commit the same mistake:

* [Forward P/E of $GOOG on Finviz: 16.30](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG)
* [Forward P/E OF $GOOGL on Finviz: 16.41](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOGL)
* [Forward P/E of $GOOG on Finviz: 19.01](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/key-statistics?p=GOOG)
* [Forward P/E of $GOOGL on Finviz: 18.90](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/key-statistics?p=GOOGL)

Guess what? The real number is bigger than those! Because this websites are taking the earnings of Google as a whole but then they are splitting that earnings between half of the shares (half for $GOOG and half for $GOOGL as if those were independent companies!)

If that is not a pro-trick that deserves twice the valuation I don't know what it is. Hats off to Google!

The right number can be calculated from [their last earnings report](https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q2_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf):

182,182,186.0,CRIME and FUCKERY after GOOG splitvidend,"Those pesky hedgies did again!

How many times do we have to witness OPEN CRIME?

For the last 2 years I have been communicating with Mr. John Leroy Henessy, founder and CEO of Google, through his cryptic tweets. After using advanced means of gathering data I realized all his tweets were exactly at 20:01.

Couldnt just be a coincidence.

I spent weeks analyzing his tweets as soon as they were posted, and came to the conclusion that this man was fighting against the big money and giving the little guy a chance of making generational money.

And there was the announcement. A split through dividend. A… “splitvidend”, if you will. You guys don’t understand how genius this move was. 

Some of you may argue that this is a simple move to lower the price per share while literally changing nothing. You are dumbasses. See, let me repeat it again, it isnt a simple split. It is a SPLIT THROUGH MEANS OF A DIVIDEND.

Yeah, you read that right. We would receive 20 times our sharecount. My portfolio would literally 20x through the night. Nothing like these shitty 4x at the dying JPEG retailer. No, we are talking 20x, baby. Genius, absolutely genius.

But then, today I opened my ComputerShare app, tits absolutely jacked, ready to be a millionaire. I had received the 20x shares… **BUT THE PRICE FELL FOR THE SAME AMOUNT!**


At first I thought it was an error from ComputerShare (honestly, their site is kinda shitty). But then I googled the price and analysing the price I realized… they did it again… SHORT LADDER ATTACKS CELLARBOXING. And, as it *”CONVENIENTLY”* was the weeknd, THEY had an excuse to remove the buy button.

THEY cant keep getting away with this. I WILL be emailing the stock market manager and ask you do the same.

In the mean time, I keep buying, hodling and DRSing. The longer THEY keep doing it, the higher the floor.

We WILL be quadriollionaires. This is a war.

So lets get to a few market things first before I touch on charts. I saw a really interesting chart today that shows the UMICH consumer sentiment vs the Russel 1000 that shows they are severely diverted from eachother. 

What does this mean? Well this is the furtherest they have ever been from eachother in the last 30 years. There is still a lot of people out there that thinks despite how far the market has come down that there is still a very long way to go. I would have thought CPI woulda started the next leg down but that is not the case… lets get into that a little bit. 

https://preview.redd.it/ntef185ersb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=205de0ab1f8401b1fea3bfa422dcde6a13c58da9

Yesterday the fed went from “we will not be doing a 100bps hike” to wow yeah man we really just might do a 100bps hike back today where now its down to a 17% chance of 100bps hike. The craziest thing about this all is if you look at the last CPI it jumped from 8.3% to 8.6% from April to May and JPOW shit himself and the markets did too with a massive 75bps hike that was not expected… now CPI is up 0.5% HIGHER than previous CPI (more than last time which was only 0.3%) and all of a sudden it doesn’t matter what we do rate hike wise and markets don’t care about 75 vs. 100bps hike? 

Confused? Me too… I touch on this a little below as to what I suspect is the true thing going on. 

https://preview.redd.it/t339fnversb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79712e9d1e204460a4cb516d7c50ff700396a6fa

I mentioned on the CPI night that I think we are experiencing some psyops in the market… the media is fueling this rollercoaster and we are being led astray for now. It is even more evident by the VIX that the “fear” is being contained right now… 

https://preview.redd.it/86mdud1grsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6863b2f55ecccf654fd87d8426b4d53b6f5ff82e

The VIX daily chart is very telling of current sentiment and that is that nothings going to take us down. After spy had 4 days of red this week and closed out today green for this week SPY is only down $0.72 cents on the week. They were close to closing this week out as a green week. 

This is the lowest close on the VIX since June 8th. Interestingly enough June 8th was the top of the last trend before we crashed. Looking at the vix there is a case that we could see a bounce Monday around 23.9 on the VIX at that support level which would let SPY truly top before we start our next leg down. 

I am also now if we break through that 23.9 level under the impression that the markets are going to completely unwind the VIX down to 18-20 level before tesla earnings hit on Wednesday night. Tesla will be the first notable earnings that could move the markets and then the week after that is massive with MSFT, GOOG, APPLE, and META. Not only that but we also have FOMC on Wednesday the 27th and then GDP is on July 28th the next day. That GDP should confirm a recession. 

Many of you red my UVXY/ VIX calls post and I do believe I was correct. The one thing I am wondering is if I was wrong on the timing. I suspect markets to panic from CPI to FOMC like previously but I am wondering if markets are going to rally from CPI to FOMC and then once that week of earnings and FOMC and GDP happen markets then panic till the next CPI and FOMC. At this point I think watching for the VIX to hit 18-20 and UVXY to hit 11.5 again to go long on some 30-60dte calls is the way to go. This is the lowest close for UVXY since April 21st interestingly enough. UVXY also has not closed under 11.5 since January. So that will be a key level to watch for next week.

The one thing im really watching on the daily is the close of this candle. It is a hanging man LIKE candle but the wick is not long enough. So this could end up like a continuation candle similar to June 23rd instead of a reversal candle like May 17th. 

https://preview.redd.it/om58fu6hrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee04dd25917171850484aaea0cbd89b3863abb7a

Things to note here for a bull vs. bear case on daily and weekly chart. 

Bull case- despite a bearish catalyst week we managed to close it with a dragonfly doji. Despite all the craziness we saw this week we saw a bullish finish to the week. We got our weekly 372 channel support test/ bounce. On the daily we broke through the red dotted resistance line which means we made a high high. We also close above the daily 8ema AND the daily 20ema for the first time since last Friday.  

Bear case- on the weekly we saw a new lower low for the third week in a row and that was also followed by the third lower high too. While we did not confirm resistance there is a VERY large descending wedge forming on the weekly chart. We have enough of the triangle left that there is a case we see a rejection next week followed by a descent below. Despite the bullish close today one could assume the last three days of bullish volume came from OPEX and how much downward OI there was. We now have a daily gap of $1.54 on the daily (note- this gap is actually closer to $2 as the daily movement of SPY never actually hit $379.05 on Thursday despite what the candles say). While historically gaps always fill we still have a 402 gap above unfilled so that is not something you can say anymore. 

Daily supports to watch- 382 à 379 (gap fill) à 375 à 370 (channel support) 

Weekly supports to watch- 372 (channel support) à 364 (weekly 200ema)

Daily resistance to watch- 388 à 390 (downward channel support AND sideways channel support) à 393 à 398 à 402 (gap fill)

Weekly resistance to watch- 388 (ascending wedge resistance) à 413 (downward channel resistance)

What I am watching for is whether we are going to attempt to back fill this gap Monday or Tuesday or whether we are going to break through 390. 390 is a HUGE level for Monday. IF that level is broken then we are actually hella bullish. With no major earnings to really effect the market and no real economic data to effect it either till Thursday at open we just might see a hell of a ripper early next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/5zggc0vhrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9804cfbd004521003749725d4227a650c72d2392

ES daily actually looks a little different than SPYs. I mentioned yesterday that it looked like futures was turning bullish and it appears Thursday might be the temp bottom again. We did see a rejection of that blue dotted support line at 3867 EOD today though but it closed over the daily 8 AND 20 ema for the first time since July 8th (which ironically was top). 

I am watching on the daily for Mondays open if we see a red open and we hold resistance at 3850 we will most likely be headed for a back test of that key 3744 support. Sundays night open will be very very important to watch. Anything over 3850 Sunday is bullish for the week. 

Daily supports to watch- 3793 à 3744 à 3672 (channel support) 

Daily resistance to watch- 3850 à 3915 (channel support) à 4020

https://preview.redd.it/305c46dirsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=946d2343961418ae9a82028e7630a4d59e9e8239

Futures weekly chart is probably the most bearish of anything I have talked about yet. So it will be curious to see which one plays out. 

The weekly chart actually confirmed the resistance of the descending triangle on Monday and closed with a true hanging man candle. This true hanging man candle has me suspect that we are going to see a retrace come Monday that takes us back down to that 3675 area. The futures charts are more skeptical and bearish then SPY itself. 

If we were to have a mega bull week next week we could see not only the descending wedge broken (any open over 3875 breaks it) we could see the overall downward channel and the overall sideways channel broken. It would take an impressive 7.7% move to do it but with the way the markets are running its not impossible. Or we could see a retest of that channel and rejection which could confirm further downside in two weeks for FOMC/ earnings/ GDP.

Weekly supports- 3830 à 3675

Weekly resistance- 3875 à 4136 à 4165

Overall SPY/ ES I would say I am bullish next week and will be looking to position to be bearish the following week. 

https://preview.redd.it/dwvgt6xirsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2140f0ae9ed8cec493e005e038ff089b4b17dbcf

AMD actually had a hell of a great day and week this week. AMD looks to on the daily have established a V shaped recovery at 71.6. My pre-market plan was to go long on AMD after it back tested 79.5 support and then go long with 7dte calls for next week looking for 87 range. I should have done it but I decided to wait. I am hesitant only that the markets are a little irrational right now. Most likely will regret that next week. 

Daily supports- 79.5 à 76.6 à 71.6

Daily resistance- 83.8 à 87

https://preview.redd.it/t7em8pjjrsb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a546f501675e7732e435ba25a37d583fd9868007

AMD weekly is in a nice descending wedge too. The weekly candle is a hanging man so that worries me but it should be able to push through if it keeps up the same momentum. Overall we are looking for 87 resistance to be tested next week and to hold that v shaped support line. If we break through 87… 95-98 is on the table for sure. But any retracement below 77 would be noted as bearish omen. 

10% challenge-

I had a great but boring day today. I did not like the open today as we dumped then ripped and had some wild candles. With the massively green open and UMICH sentiment I knew I was not going to go in until closer to 1030-11. By them we were already at the probable high of day IV wise and I was not going to play anything above that. My strategy is very strict about not going long/ short when SPY hits those levels. I also noticed that IV on SPY and AMD were hella high today and my mid day we got crushed. I watched 384.6 resistance hold all day long and EOD played a nice SPX (my first one) 0dte put scalp off the breakdown and then played a SPY 0dte call once biden was done talking and the volume came pumping in. Overall GREAT day and GREAT week. 

This is actually the highest weekly WIN RATE year to date for me. This week I was EXTRA patient and really waited for my plays and waited for the chart to come to me. It made all the difference.

I look forward to a good weekend to rest. I am sitting cash gang over the weekend. I was tempted to go long on SPY calls but decided to stick to what it old myself at the beginning of the month and do no swings. The biggest loss this week came from CPI day. It came from ANTICIPATING a play AND it came from trading while SPY was at the probable IV range. I did not stick to my guns that day and I did not let the chart come to me. I also double down on that loser which became 2x as big of a loser. Doubling down can work when tactfully done… but most of the time like I have said before don’t add to a loser to make it a bigger loser… I also took a loss on Monday due to TOS not filling my order completely which is a logistical issue I could not avoid and is part of the risk of 0dtes in the last 15minutes. 

Overall great week for me mentally and trading wise. Look forward to the weekend with the fam and seeing you guys back on Monday!",vzz7j9,67.0,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vzz7j9/71522_spy_es_futures_vix_uvxy_and_amd_weekly_ta/,1657919235.0,2022-07-15 17:07:15,0.0

For everyone else, here's what I'm seeing in the charts, if you're into that sorta thing.

**SPY:**

https://preview.redd.it/xp44b7g01ha91.png?width=5744&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f2b518fbe0f3da341b79eebe6a61892e2f6a49

This weekly chart just further outlines the trend reversal that the daily divergences have been showing leading into this rally.

&#x200B;

**QQQ:**

https://preview.redd.it/7xigs6v63ha91.png?width=5744&format=png&auto=webp&s=b21aa5cff8d8d35acb8c7c6c382e2146a93c5dee

Going to use QQQ this week because some of you are so smooth-brained that you didn't know there were any other NASDAQ ETF's and were so proud of yourselves trying to call me out about it.

Anyway, looks like we've officially broken out of this falling wedge thanks to the big guys waking up (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT), the others are close behind.  I'd be looking for the $300 gap to fill leading into CPI, then a pullback because it's fucked, possibly down to around $285 support, maybe lower.  Ideally I'd be looking for re-entry / entry / adding to longs at a completed back-test of the trendline we just broke this week.  Regardless of what the Fed does this month, this rally has some legs and will continue for a while, or so the technicals are indicating...

For context of the reversal manifesting in the Weekly charts, QQQ's look just like SPY 

https://preview.redd.it/s1hg8thp2ha91.png?width=5744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ff23ad7fe76267e16139bdc1f522c1b3dda2932

Here's a quick look at the put/call ratio, focus on the blue line (9-day MA).  Notice how June 14th we put in a lower high which coincides with the higher low in the indices this week, then crossing down below the 0.95 line breaking trend and confirming that people are becoming more bullish on the market.

&#x200B;

**10Y**

Still inside this rising wedge pattern on bearish divergence in the PPO and somewhat in the RSI.  Will still need to wait it out but it looks like a reversal is coming in both the 10 and 2 year, keeping in mind, we're STILL inverted since like Thursday of last week.

Let's talk BANKS since we're coming up on earnings next week!

**BAC:  Earnings 7/18**

https://preview.redd.it/58ma3p1f8ha91.png?width=5744&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc928df6038897136505e52b56ce61ed524752a4

Bank of America has been in this falling wedge for a while and has recently started to show some bullish divergence in the RSI, not so much in the PPO though.  I think we have a pretty solid floor under us at around $31 which was resistance back in 2019.  We have a gap just above some potential resistance around $34 which I think we hit easily, will deal with the gap when we get there.

**JPM:  Earnings 7/14**

https://preview.redd.it/lsz06oej9ha91.png?width=5744&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ab06934305b15c42978ca614eaf8f5808cfddb7

JP Morgan Chase!  
JP Morgan Chase!  
JP Morgan Chase!  
JPM has also been inside this falling wedge for a while with a bit better defined bullish divergence.  Again a solid floor under us with a nice rejection off of a previous gap left open since Nov. 2020.  Overhead resistance at $117.50-ish I think will be pushed through pretty easily and likely won't see much push back from the bears until the $125 gap.

**GS:  Earnings 7/18**

https://preview.redd.it/r68xe8pnaha91.png?width=5744&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac0192b4927c8aa6793a16e89c8c6d94c5b29dd6

I think I'm less confident in this one.  The falling broadening wedge is bullish but I'm not seeing as solid footing as the others at this point, we're kind of in the middle of support/resistance right now and the divergences in the RSI and PPO aren't really as convincing as JPM.

**VIX**

https://preview.redd.it/85h8p64abha91.png?width=5744&format=png&auto=webp&s=5767b1fb31bcea6b4c71c31b66f28aa58f36e553

Yah, so what, i do TA on the VIX, wanna fight about it?

Showing the 1-hr chart on this one to keep everyone on their toes.  Today we fell out the bottom of this falling wedge with bullish divergence still intact on the RSI, BUT burned through on the PPO, hopefully that trend continues into the PPO.  Lately the money glitch has been buy puts at VIX $25, buy calls at VIX $35 and I'm here to tell you that didn't work today.

Keep an eye on this bastard though, if it claws its way back into this wedge then look for a big fat stinky dump shortly there after.

**Conclusion:**

I think Bond investors are flooding into equities right now so we're likely going to see continuation of this rally much to the perma-bear's chagrin.  I wouldn't get too comfortable though if you're long because at any moment they could decide to flood back into bonds as a safe haven, it really depends on that the Fed does at the July FOMC, till then however, I'll be buying the dip.

194,194,198.0,u/hoopmbb6279 asked me to post my positions and prove that my account is up about 50% in the last few weeks from $26k to $40k,"In another post someone commented that everyone is losing money right now. I claimed that I was up around 50% in the last few weeks. u/hoopmbb6279 joked that making $0.50 on your last $1 isn't that hard. I responded that I've gone from about $26k to about $40k, and he asked me to prove it. So here we are.

First of all, it turns out I was slightly wrong. I thought I had gone from $32k to $26k (IRA contribution) then up to $40k, which is where I got the +50% number. It turns out I went from $32k to $35k on some calls, then IRA contribution down to $29k, then up to $40k. So, similar but different.

[Here's the current value of the account](https://preview.redd.it/07xeih2bns691.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae985cdb034aa90fbbd2071cf96d4b3b05cb419)

So you can see, the account had basically nothing it in, about $300. Lucky for me, my wife's boyfriend gave me my allowance for the year all up front so I stuck the $32k in this account. I made a little money at the end of May, made my IRA contribution a week later, and then have made about $11k in the last two weeks.

Which brings me to my final positions. Roughly equal parts Cash, $AMZN, and $GOOG. 

And holding 50 x 6/24 9C ahead of their Polestar vote on Wednesday.

# If this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.
