The premium is going to be really cheap right now while VIX is so low and IV is low… We very well as I said could push to 420… so I would start small maybe 10-20% of your desired position size. \\n\\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5ah3c4und3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de7481c8368f2e26d0051fd4183b1ec110e7822b\\n\\nFinally was able to secure a bigger win on my $5k challenge play.

I was actually extremely surprised to open at only -40% and when it slightly push my way I took my exit. I thought that would be a great risk management loss but had I held a little longer and played the move back to my 407.8 magnet then I woulda closed around 50-60%. \\n\\nScalps and even l2l plays were fire today! I have not seen premiums pay as well as they did today in a very long time. I played 4dte for all of my SPY L2L today and the premiums were move extremely favorable. I stopped myself out of that call at -7% because I expected a bigger breakdown and thought I would get stopped out so I exited early… I watched it all the way down and I never woulda broke my -20% stop loss had I held and it woulda gone on to be very profitable too. \\n\\nOverall a pretty great day. I did take small wins on almost all of my L2L plays only to watch them double or triple pretty much instantly after I exited. But I am super happy with profits and with the day overall.

However if this was the top of this red channel we could be looking for a break down back to at least 180. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4g4dh4tnd3a1.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335e26f5b5631dae2bcb00856f1233afe63d4c31\\n\\nThe VIX continues to unwind and despite this red day on SPY we are finally seeing the VIX near 19.7 levels. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5p73zmtnd3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a3ea6cf9e036c54fd6c59a1c9b65091567bbedf\\n\\nWith Spy breaking through the bear market resistance line, the FG hitting 70 today which is the highest level all year and SPY breaking through its bear market resistance line… this could be the best area to start loading some 60-90dte puts ATM. The premium is going to be really cheap right now while VIX is so low and IV is low… We very well as I said could push to 420… so I would start small maybe 10-20% of your desired position size. \\n\\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5ah3c4und3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de7481c8368f2e26d0051fd4183b1ec110e7822b\\n\\nFinally was able to secure a bigger win on my $5k challenge play. Overall a GREAT week there for sure. \\n\\n**Daily Log-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3e8o8jund3a1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15fee286f9abcada1349b7ea120ab163cccf33a\\n\\nI had played a half sized 0dte put overnight. I was actually extremely surprised to open at only -40% and when it slightly push my way I took my exit. I thought that would be a great risk management loss but had I held a little longer and played the move back to my 407.8 magnet then I woulda closed around 50-60%. \\n\\nScalps and even l2l plays were fire today! I have not seen premiums pay as well as they did today in a very long time. I played 4dte for all of my SPY L2L today and the premiums were move extremely favorable. I stopped myself out of that call at -7% because I expected a bigger breakdown and thought I would get stopped out so I exited early… I watched it all the way down and I never woulda broke my -20% stop loss had I held and it woulda gone on to be very profitable too. \\n\\nOverall a pretty great day. I did take small wins on almost all of my L2L plays only to watch them double or triple pretty much instantly after I exited. But I am super happy with profits and with the day overall. Been a great week so far!\\n\\nYOUTUBE WILL BE UP LATER', 'title': '12-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'created': 1669940130.0}),\n",

However, we very well could see a fake breakout and then sell off at a later point. \\n\\nFor the daily chart that level is 408.4 and for the weekly chart that level is 409.8.

IT was a very similar situation too. That day was followed up by a -1.1% red open and a -3.55% red day. It’s a possibility but this market is truly on full bull mode right now. \\n\\nIts also noted that today was the highest volume day at 145mil since the October CPI. \\n\\nWhat am I leaning towards? My realistic side says that we might have just put the top in with a massive blow off top and that we could end up with really bad PCE data tomorrow which takes us right back under 405.2… however, I also recognize that this market since even before last CPI has been full bull and this could have just re-ignited their flame to take this through bear market resistance and possibly even 420+. \\n\\nTomorrow should be pretty telling. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1lgq0oyv63a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13e0a90149000364dd9e8e14a5319f72a0be6c5a\\n\\nWe now get to watch overnight IF futures will breakout of that bear market resistance line or not… that level comes in at 4105 overnight for the daily and 4120 for the weekly timeframe.

However, we had seen tesla massively reject the weekly 200ema when it did that. \\n\\nWe are not seeing tesla close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September 21st… which was the start of the this two month long drop. \\n\\nWe might actually see Tesla find its support here and we might see it push even higher over the next few weeks.

I took a spy call off 395 support this morning that I stopped myself out of at -10.3% that had I let it run it never would have hit my -20% stop and well you can imagine how green that would have been… I also took a Tesla call off of the 180 support area that got stopped out right before the JPOW speech that as you can imagine also turned hella green. \\n\\nThe only thing I woulda done differently is gone with a further DTE or seen them through. It is always tough playing extremely volatile and high IV days. \\n\\nI called out and played a straddle (my document says strangle but it was a straddle). I ended up closing my call side on the first pump to 399.2 and then on the first big retrace closed my puts for a loss. Overall about a 30% win but it was messy and not the proper way to handle a straddle. I had even purposefully gone smaller lotto sized and I shoulda just let it run its course. \\n\\nStill a green day and still a pretty green week too. After almost 5 weeks in a row where L2L plays paid more than scalps this might now be my 2nd week in a row that scalps pay more than my L2l plays.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0528z8g2w63a1.png?width=305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f5f7f8f190bb3d939b188a505765eca213bfd51\\n\\nDoing my monthly round up here. Overall I have had a killer month of scalping that’s for sure… 92.08% win rate for the whole month is probably one of my best months of scalping ever. \\n\\nAs many of you know I have been weighing my level to level plays and whether or not they are worth it or better than my SPY/ SPX scalps. Looking strictly at SPY l2l plays I see that I averaged a 75% win rate which I expected a lower win rate but my profit rate was very good. Now I have been wondering IF tesla was worth it to keep in my lineup or not. I truly enjoy trading Tesla (probably because its volatile and helps on days that SPY is boring). However, I see that I put in about 50% of the profits on Tesla l2l than I did on SPY l2l. The win rates are not too far off though. \\n\\nI am indifferent about whether to continue my tesla L2L plays or not. I think for now I will give this another month or so before I officially rotate it out. The one thing I did notice about my Tesla L2L compared to SPY is that a lot of my profits on Tesla have come from pretty large wins on Tesla overnight swings. \\n\\nI will be monitoring Tesla L2L closely over the new week or two and decide officially to rotate it out of my lineup and just focus on SPY once again or not. \\n\\nNO YOUTUBE TONIGHT!', title='11-30-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', upvote_ratio=1.0, created=1669858144.0, d_={'created_utc': 1669858144, 'id': 'z9a15m', 'selftext': 'Overall not a bad day… took a nice little play on the JPOW speech as seen below… shoulda held my calls but was hesitatant after the last few FOMCs… im impressed how dovish jpow came in actually…\\n\\nI fully expected as you can see for us to hit 399.2 I was not really a believer that we would hit 405.2 but hit it and broke through it!

My realistic side says that we might have just put the top in with a massive blow off top and that we could end up with really bad PCE data tomorrow which takes us right back under 405.2… however, I also recognize that this market since even before last CPI has been full bull and this could have just re-ignited their flame to take this through bear market resistance and possibly even 420+. \\n\\nTomorrow should be pretty telling. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1lgq0oyv63a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13e0a90149000364dd9e8e14a5319f72a0be6c5a\\n\\nWe now get to watch overnight IF futures will breakout of that bear market resistance line or not… that level comes in at 4105 overnight for the daily and 4120 for the weekly timeframe. We will keep a really close eye on 4095 overnight as that could lead to a big double top and a retrace back into that red channel. \\n\\nNext major upside target will be 4200 for Futures. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vy8q9u7zv63a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c29f9f55d2872f3430cd95d465802e4906c95c8f\\n\\nRegardless of what SPY did today I was bullish on Tesla… I mentioned earlier in the week that it had broken through the weekly bear channel. However, we had seen tesla massively reject the weekly 200ema when it did that. \\n\\nWe are not seeing tesla close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September 21st… which was the start of the this two month long drop. \\n\\nWe might actually see Tesla find its support here and we might see it push even higher over the next few weeks. If we see a push up tomorrow 196.1 will be a major resistance for it to fight at and 204.9 will also be a major resistance to watch. \\n\\nKey support- 190.8 -&gt; 185.2 -&gt; 180.1\\n\\nKey resistance- 196.1 -&gt; 200.9 -&gt; 204.9\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ocbwxn21w63a1.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a299745a24a716891b81dbd0ea6a7df563ba2bf5\\n\\nEven with the pretty big pop IV had intraday today and the VIX pushing green this morning the VIX maintained its bear channel and dropped back under the daily 8ema and gap filled the November 25th gap. \\n\\nWe are now eyeing once again that critical 19.7 level on the VIX. \\n\\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrum8xh1w63a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14219c1e8c8542db47766fb0b23e0fa21105560f\\n\\n**Daily log-** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Processing img nloifzy1w63a1...*\\n\\nI have actually really been struggling with the level to level plays this week. I took a spy call off 395 support this morning that I stopped myself out of at -10.3% that had I let it run it never would have hit my -20% stop and well you can imagine how green that would have been… I also took a Tesla call off of the 180 support area that got stopped out right before the JPOW speech that as you can imagine also turned hella green. \\n\\nThe only thing I woulda done differently is gone with a further DTE or seen them through. It is always tough playing extremely volatile and high IV days. \\n\\nI called out and played a straddle (my document says strangle but it was a straddle). I ended up closing my call side on the first pump to 399.2 and then on the first big retrace closed my puts for a loss. Overall about a 30% win but it was messy and not the proper way to handle a straddle. I had even purposefully gone smaller lotto sized and I shoulda just let it run its course. \\n\\nStill a green day and still a pretty green week too. After almost 5 weeks in a row where L2L plays paid more than scalps this might now be my 2nd week in a row that scalps pay more than my L2l plays.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0528z8g2w63a1.png?width=305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f5f7f8f190bb3d939b188a505765eca213bfd51\\n\\nDoing my monthly round up here. Overall I have had a killer month of scalping that’s for sure… 92.08% win rate for the whole month is probably one of my best months of scalping ever. \\n\\nAs many of you know I have been weighing my level to level plays and whether or not they are worth it or better than my SPY/ SPX scalps. Looking strictly at SPY l2l plays I see that I averaged a 75% win rate which I expected a lower win rate but my profit rate was very good. Now I have been wondering IF tesla was worth it to keep in my lineup or not. I truly enjoy trading Tesla (probably because its volatile and helps on days that SPY is boring). However, I see that I put in about 50% of the profits on Tesla l2l than I did on SPY l2l. The win rates are not too far off though. \\n\\nI am indifferent about whether to continue my tesla L2L plays or not. I think for now I will give this another month or so before I officially rotate it out. The one thing I did notice about my Tesla L2L compared to SPY is that a lot of my profits on Tesla have come from pretty large wins on Tesla overnight swings. \\n\\nI will be monitoring Tesla L2L closely over the new week or two and decide officially to rotate it out of my lineup and just focus on SPY once again or not. \\n\\nNO YOUTUBE TONIGHT!', 'title': '11-30-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'created': 1669858144.0}),\n",

But we saw a 182.5 support level come in and now we should look for 182.5 to 184.8 to be our new magnet on Tesla. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iliq166pky2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7f61f43eb7d927a5d3cc68fb662e22e7cb9e99d\\n\\nMy intentions today was to play puts overnight for the economic data and JPOW speech tomorrow however, I saw too much of a bullish case on SPY to warrant puts overnight. I considered a straddle but im not sure if we will get a big enough movement to make it worth the capital risked. \\n\\nWe saw the daily 8ema confirmed as resistance and we broke down o that key 393.7 support level (from the 15min volatility) and that’s as low as we went today. With that EOD recovery and closure back over 395.2 we are actually seeing a potential that we are still trading within that same 395.2 to 399.2 area that we have been trading in for the last 2 weeks. \\n\\nThis doji after 3 red days could set us up with that 395.2 closure for a move back towards 399.2 tomorrow. However, if this economic data comes in rough and depending on what JPOW says tomorrow at 130pm we really could see 390 or we could see 402.5 tomorrow. I don’t have a strong feeling either way besides I think JPOW continues to be far more bearish than the markets want to believe. \\n\\nSupport- 395.2 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1\\n\\nResistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.5\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2y9sbaopky2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=155e7c2376c1f651461d523ba2bde36ef72b5137\\n\\nFutures with a similar break down but held its 3955 support level from the last two weeks very nicely.

This is the 5th rejection at 185.2 in the last 8 trading days. As you can see highlighted in blue we are in this overall bull channel here but we are rejecting at the bigger macro falling wedge here in red. This is our 2nd day of rejecting the falling wedge resistance without breaking through. \\n\\nHowever for the bull case we attempted and for a while we were looking like we would break through 180 support and close below that which would have resulted in a bearish engulfing daily candle. Despite the closure below the daily 8ema failure to have a meaningful sell off today and to lose that key 180 support does open more upside. \\n\\nKey support- 180 -&gt; 173.6\\n\\nKey resistance- 185.1 -&gt; 190.8\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxchwzzrky2a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a67b9c3b3cba5b9c6aee9b093851208d9ce5a7ab\\n\\nThe VIX did a whole lot of nothing today. Holding within yesterdays range pretty much all day but it did close below its daily 8ema support again. The VIX does not really give us any sort of direction either. These 3 dojis in a row show indecision in the market and show that we very well could with todays gravestone doji see the VIX unwind tomorrow and look to gap fill at 21.11. However, with JPOW speech tomorrow and with all the economic data tomorrow we very well could see the VIX move up and possibly even touch that bear channel resistance at 22.7 tomorrow. However, in order to be full bear I would like to see a closure over the daily 20ema which should be near 23.61 tomorrow. 23.6 also happens to be our lower channel resistance level too.

I should have played weekend swing puts but I was happy to sit cash as the weekends are pretty unpredictable as of late. \\n\\nBear case- today we opened red and attempted to retake the daily 200ema however was unable to, we broke the 3+ week long daily rising wedge pattern and we closed below the daily 8ema for the first time since the day before CPI. \\n\\nBull case- despite the rejection and closing under the daily 8 and 200ema we did bounce pretty hard off the key support range of 395 to 395.5 today. We are still maintaining that key lower support range of this consolidation pattern that SPY has been in since November 11th. \\n\\nFor me this breakdown shows that we have a potential to retest 390.1 support and potentially even lower depending on what JPOW says on Wednesday and depending on what all the economic data comes in at. I am bearish until we touch 390.1… If we touch and bounce off 390.1 again then I am seeing a nice consolidation channel from 390.1 to 402.5 and will play it at such. However if we break through and close under 390.1 then I am looking for at minimum the gap fill at 381.2. \\n\\nKey support- 396 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1\\n\\nKey resistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.4\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yg2o8cigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7777e1ba5e61d8807db2c0425b639b37064fc223\\n\\nMuch of the same case here on futures breaking that rising wedge. However, futures is still holding over one of the key support levels of 3970. If we see futures lose 3955 then I would feel confident in a 3910 retest of support. However, if futures can break back over 4000 we can start talking about a retest of 4020 and then 4040.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v7aupuigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f55ad1ead9b49c0b10d8422a4714ce3f91b96ae\\n\\nTesla has the biggest bearish case of them all in my opinion when we look at the daily chart. We had that green support line that was 3 days long until today. That line was broke through today we also failed to even reach the falling wedge resistance line before we retraced. With this gravestone doji closing at Fridays candle body support of 182.9 this should open up some pretty large downside tomorrow.

However if we play out the % drop of 17.82% but not the number of days it took to get there we could see by November 30th (2 days) a touch of the red support line at 154.5. \\n\\nRealistically I would look for a test of support near 148-155 in the next 4-7 trading days.

I called out this morning based on volatility that we could see 395 today… we had such a massive gap after that 399.2 support that it was the natural place we should move to. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnwo7sqggr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abf2ba3a3f27976acebf648f553204adc7d7f687\\n\\nInterestingly enough… after 393.7 support if we lose that volatility wise we have no real established support area until all the way down to 373.7. Could we be headed for a CPI gap fill over the next few weeks? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uulb209hgr2a1.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f47ab0bb77cac550303eb25827940f1e4fb1da36\\n\\nI believe we have quite the bear case forming here on spy with a smaller bull potential. But lets take a look at what we have here now…\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqlsg5qhgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203546bf0ee653d203b63ec303e2c475d05f5080\\n\\nLooking at SPY daily here I called out on Friday that I suspected that tiny gravestone doji double top rejection at 402.4 would open up the downside for today and I was correct. I should have played weekend swing puts but I was happy to sit cash as the weekends are pretty unpredictable as of late. \\n\\nBear case- today we opened red and attempted to retake the daily 200ema however was unable to, we broke the 3+ week long daily rising wedge pattern and we closed below the daily 8ema for the first time since the day before CPI. \\n\\nBull case- despite the rejection and closing under the daily 8 and 200ema we did bounce pretty hard off the key support range of 395 to 395.5 today. We are still maintaining that key lower support range of this consolidation pattern that SPY has been in since November 11th. \\n\\nFor me this breakdown shows that we have a potential to retest 390.1 support and potentially even lower depending on what JPOW says on Wednesday and depending on what all the economic data comes in at. I am bearish until we touch 390.1… If we touch and bounce off 390.1 again then I am seeing a nice consolidation channel from 390.1 to 402.5 and will play it at such. However if we break through and close under 390.1 then I am looking for at minimum the gap fill at 381.2. \\n\\nKey support- 396 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1\\n\\nKey resistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.4\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yg2o8cigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7777e1ba5e61d8807db2c0425b639b37064fc223\\n\\nMuch of the same case here on futures breaking that rising wedge. However, futures is still holding over one of the key support levels of 3970. If we see futures lose 3955 then I would feel confident in a 3910 retest of support. However, if futures can break back over 4000 we can start talking about a retest of 4020 and then 4040.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v7aupuigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f55ad1ead9b49c0b10d8422a4714ce3f91b96ae\\n\\nTesla has the biggest bearish case of them all in my opinion when we look at the daily chart. We had that green support line that was 3 days long until today. That line was broke through today we also failed to even reach the falling wedge resistance line before we retraced. With this gravestone doji closing at Fridays candle body support of 182.9 this should open up some pretty large downside tomorrow. The only real bullish case I see for Tesla right now is that it did recover and close back over its daily 8ema EOD. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sb5nbidjgr2a1.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e956cfe851e89a8798726f581aa3fa6c67216bc\\n\\nLast week I shared with you guys that tesla had a pretty uniformed drop and recovery cycle. I was seeing that we were averaging a drop of about 6.8 days for 17.82% while the recovery was about 4.5 days of 12.08%. \\n\\nWith todays new short term high we officially put in our 4th recovery day and reached 13.4% total recovery. \\n\\nIf we are trusting this trend that has been playing out for 3 months now that means we should expect about a 7day sell off of about 17.82% which puts Tesla at 154.9 around December 7th. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1l8qyrtjgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7af3c1395a4edfaa0271107bcd192d0826b9512\\n\\nIf we play out the falling wedge here by December 7th we could see 148.7 which is a total drop of 21.2%. However if we play out the % drop of 17.82% but not the number of days it took to get there we could see by November 30th (2 days) a touch of the red support line at 154.5. \\n\\nRealistically I would look for a test of support near 148-155 in the next 4-7 trading days.

Last week touched 4050.75 and this week saw a high of 4049.25. With the weekly 50ema clearly being resistance this is going to be our key level to watch next week of 4050. However, we have found really nice support on the weekly 20ema down near 3925. \\n\\nThat blue rising wedge support line sits at 4050 and unless we open and hold that then we should expect a retrace next week. \\n\\nBear market resistance for futures weekly sits at 4120 for next week with key level resistance at 4085.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ne3c8zpt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee284393c0f81ac4f792f0dea2d56eba4c7b69e\\n\\nSo looking ahead to next week… we got some gnarly data coming out AND we got JPOW speaking at 130pm Wednesday where he WILL be answering questions. Honestly with this economic data lineup I would not be surprised to see a choppy Monday/ Tuesday (maybe slightly green) and see a pretty large sell off the rest of the week. \\n\\nLooking at tesla it was once again the victim. Having yet again another large pre market that by open was miniscule and led to a red day. This may be the third or 4th time in the last two weeks I have seen this happen. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98ttt3lqt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8baa5ded2708a51d68c34a5d8e1d785f38c89af\\n\\nI posted this analysis of Tesla and its history of drops followed by pops since September. Well we are at day 3 of the pop and we are looking at about a 11.7% move from that bottom to current HOD. That’s pretty damn close to the average 4.2 day pop of 11.81%. \\n\\nI actually was pretty tempted to play puts on Tesla due to this trend but I did want to wait out Monday. I am seeing a nice double top right at 185.2 resistance. However, with Tesla holding the daily 8ema and still holding that green support line I was more nervous to jump into puts. There is a chance this pop could last another day or two and we could see a test of the daily 20ema near 192.5 Monday or of the red falling wedge resistance at 190.1 Monday. However, unless Tesla opens green and holds 185.2 Monday then we should break support line and I will be looking at the next leg down. \\n\\nHistorically speaking… we should look for about a 7day drop of 17.8%... so assuming that today was the top that means by December 6th we should look for a drop to about 152.2. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r2rn16rt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f978f535ead6ae4cb9800b78ae1d3e72dc5361\\n\\nLooking at Tesla falling wedge and the support line of that for December 6th that would give us a support bounce of about 150.6, however, if you look at this previous drop we did not touch the support line completely. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmbbqjmrt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fbb644d301cbccbb44076501172bc8a532d386\\n\\nTesla weekly did break through the red bear channel resistance. This is the resistance if we use support from the October 3rd and 10th weekly candles and project it to the peak of the October 31st candle. However, there is also a blue bear channel using the peak of September 19th and October 31st candles. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7nkv04st52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d18513a39dc8d9ff04be246612f0d1f6ed732b9\\n\\nIt would then make our weekly chart look like this. I personally put far more weight into the blue bear channel than I do the red bear channel. That would mean we actually did not break through resistance and have resistance pegged at that magical 185.3 level next week. If Tesla holds under that level all week then that is a rejection of the bear channel and should bring more down side. I am seeing a bullish reversal dragonfly doji candle formed here, however, we DID fail to close back over the daily 200ema. This daily 200ema next week could act as resistance and form a double top which would lead to further downside. \\n\\nKey support- 166.4 -&gt; 154.2\\n\\nKey resistance- 192.9 -&gt; 207.2\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo36u9ptt52a1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8ba1b78bc7c3e30c79e1926b9e943141d926dd\\n\\nThe VIX is finally nearing that danger zone. That lower red highlighted channel of 19.7 to 16.5. Every time a “peak” on SPY has been put in the VIX has broken under 19.7 or touched it first. \\n\\nI am really eyeing a case of VIX touching 19.7 or below Monday or Tuesday this week with SPY rejecting 405-410 area and then come Wednesday through Friday we see a pretty large drop due to JPOW and the economic data coming out. \\n\\n**$5k/10% challenge-** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og005m4ut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5735a8738ed1fdd0aa063b6f671d5fa4a1c45cc\\n\\nAnother week of green here on the Challenge closing out with a net profit of $980 this week and total profits over the two weeks ive been running this challenge of $1740. \\n\\n**Daily log-**\\n\\nUnfortunately I struggled this week quite a bit. However, my biggest losses came from once again holding too long. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfisi5tut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20de760d00def936f1d3ec68e15ae7538cc88422\\n\\nLooking at my weekly analysis here I actually impressively hit 100% win rate on all my SPY scalps this week. Had a pretty mild profit between the normal scalps/ $5k scalps of $1980 this week. I only scalped a total of 7 times this week with 3 of those coming from today. I just didn’t see a lot of good setups this week for scalps and struggled finding a good read on the technical earlier in the week. \\n\\nLooking at my level to level plays this is actually the first week I believe in about 7 weeks of playing level to level/ swings that I have close out my week red for strictly the level to level plays. The biggest mistake this week was my stop losses on those. I started the week off with a pretty large -50% loss on Tesla. It had popped from about -40% to -25% and then immediately to -50% before I could really do much on a massive drop. I also took a put on FOMC minute day to -78% that had I mitigated my loss properly at -20% or the -5% right before minutes I would have actually ended my week green. I as I had said was FAR too bearish for FOMC minutes (which I think come Wednesday when JPOW speaks im going to find out I was right but market didn’t react that way) and burnt myself. \\n\\nI also took a pretty large loss on a SPX call overnight last night. I have not seen the IV crush the way it did on SPX/ SPY overnight. I know we had the holiday and everything but for SPY opening barely down 0.1% I believe it was and for my strike being the first strike OTM I was extremely shocked to see my position open -65%. I was able to get out around -60% but that one hurt a lot. I don’t think anyone who played anything (unless they sold options) won with a swing today. \\n\\nMorale of the story is I let my losers run more than I let me winners run. This week I failed to properly mitigate my losses and that was a big mistake and one I will continue to learn from next week. \\n\\nOverall closing out the week at a total -$594 which is not bad in all reality but it is still my first red week since the week of September 12th. Looking to get back on a good track Monday and get back on that green gain train. \\n\\nI hope everyone has a great weekend! \\n\\nI will have YOUTUBE up later tonight or tomorrow (got some people doing work at the house and don’t have quiet time to make the video).', title='11-25-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Market Recap and Analysis', upvote_ratio=1.0, created=1669409445.0, d_={'created_utc': 1669409445, 'id': 'z4ntqf', 'selftext': 'Tough week really a tough two weeks of trading since CPI that we have had.

However, unless Tesla opens green and holds 185.2 Monday then we should break support line and I will be looking at the next leg down. \\n\\nHistorically speaking… we should look for about a 7day drop of 17.8%... so assuming that today was the top that means by December 6th we should look for a drop to about 152.2. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r2rn16rt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f978f535ead6ae4cb9800b78ae1d3e72dc5361\\n\\nLooking at Tesla falling wedge and the support line of that for December 6th that would give us a support bounce of about 150.6, however, if you look at this previous drop we did not touch the support line completely. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmbbqjmrt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fbb644d301cbccbb44076501172bc8a532d386\\n\\nTesla weekly did break through the red bear channel resistance. This is the resistance if we use support from the October 3rd and 10th weekly candles and project it to the peak of the October 31st candle. However, there is also a blue bear channel using the peak of September 19th and October 31st candles. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7nkv04st52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d18513a39dc8d9ff04be246612f0d1f6ed732b9\\n\\nIt would then make our weekly chart look like this. I personally put far more weight into the blue bear channel than I do the red bear channel. That would mean we actually did not break through resistance and have resistance pegged at that magical 185.3 level next week. If Tesla holds under that level all week then that is a rejection of the bear channel and should bring more down side. I am seeing a bullish reversal dragonfly doji candle formed here, however, we DID fail to close back over the daily 200ema. This daily 200ema next week could act as resistance and form a double top which would lead to further downside. \\n\\nKey support- 166.4 -&gt; 154.2\\n\\nKey resistance- 192.9 -&gt; 207.2\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo36u9ptt52a1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8ba1b78bc7c3e30c79e1926b9e943141d926dd\\n\\nThe VIX is finally nearing that danger zone. That lower red highlighted channel of 19.7 to 16.5. Every time a “peak” on SPY has been put in the VIX has broken under 19.7 or touched it first. \\n\\nI am really eyeing a case of VIX touching 19.7 or below Monday or Tuesday this week with SPY rejecting 405-410 area and then come Wednesday through Friday we see a pretty large drop due to JPOW and the economic data coming out. \\n\\n**$5k/10% challenge-** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og005m4ut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5735a8738ed1fdd0aa063b6f671d5fa4a1c45cc\\n\\nAnother week of green here on the Challenge closing out with a net profit of $980 this week and total profits over the two weeks ive been running this challenge of $1740. \\n\\n**Daily log-**\\n\\nUnfortunately I struggled this week quite a bit. However, my biggest losses came from once again holding too long. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfisi5tut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20de760d00def936f1d3ec68e15ae7538cc88422\\n\\nLooking at my weekly analysis here I actually impressively hit 100% win rate on all my SPY scalps this week. Had a pretty mild profit between the normal scalps/ $5k scalps of $1980 this week. I only scalped a total of 7 times this week with 3 of those coming from today. I just didn’t see a lot of good setups this week for scalps and struggled finding a good read on the technical earlier in the week. \\n\\nLooking at my level to level plays this is actually the first week I believe in about 7 weeks of playing level to level/ swings that I have close out my week red for strictly the level to level plays. The biggest mistake this week was my stop losses on those. I started the week off with a pretty large -50% loss on Tesla. It had popped from about -40% to -25% and then immediately to -50% before I could really do much on a massive drop. I also took a put on FOMC minute day to -78% that had I mitigated my loss properly at -20% or the -5% right before minutes I would have actually ended my week green. I as I had said was FAR too bearish for FOMC minutes (which I think come Wednesday when JPOW speaks im going to find out I was right but market didn’t react that way) and burnt myself. \\n\\nI also took a pretty large loss on a SPX call overnight last night. I have not seen the IV crush the way it did on SPX/ SPY overnight. I know we had the holiday and everything but for SPY opening barely down 0.1% I believe it was and for my strike being the first strike OTM I was extremely shocked to see my position open -65%. I was able to get out around -60% but that one hurt a lot. I don’t think anyone who played anything (unless they sold options) won with a swing today. \\n\\nMorale of the story is I let my losers run more than I let me winners run. This week I failed to properly mitigate my losses and that was a big mistake and one I will continue to learn from next week. \\n\\nOverall closing out the week at a total -$594 which is not bad in all reality but it is still my first red week since the week of September 12th. Looking to get back on a good track Monday and get back on that green gain train. \\n\\nI hope everyone has a great weekend! \\n\\nI will have YOUTUBE up later tonight or tomorrow (got some people doing work at the house and don’t have quiet time to make the video).', 'title': '11-25-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Market Recap and Analysis', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'created': 1669409445.0}),\n",

This should open us up to some more upside and we also closed over that key 398.5 resistance. The next major support is 401.2 followed by 405.4. With FOMC minutes tomorrow and a lot of fed speakers I really don’t expect much bullish movement and the minutes are going to reconfirm just how hawkish jpow is right now. The keys level we need to watch is 398.5 and 401.2 tomorrow. Those will be our gateways. Also if we do close over 401.2 then we would be closing over the daily 200ema and that really would be a bullish sign. \\n\\nAt this point there isn’t a big reason to short SPY until we close back under the daily 8ema. But again as I have said going long (think 30-60dte) here also seems like FOMO and chasing. Best thing to do here is to pay the short term. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d5k748kel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f2ddf776549b8a693987ea7cb0e65665af364c\\n\\nFutures also broke its diamond pattern but instead of showing you that again here I am going to show you this rising wedge that is on futures and SPYs daily chart. This is very key to watch and could lead us to a touch of the 2022 bear market resistance line (the thicker green line) and this could be the pattern to watch to show the next leg down. \\n\\nWith a closure over 4000 now and breaking the 3955 to 4000 consolidation period we naturally will be looking for the upside here. Key resistance is the daily 200ema at 4028 followed by 4060 and 4090. Key support is now 4010 and 3955. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0capz6qkel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba4aabadb510fbf98d3ce4a4930292c15c658c29\\n\\nTesla did make a new low today despite closing green. I posted some analyzed data on tesla with its drops and pops so lets update these now and see what they show…\\n\\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \\n\\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \\n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \\n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \\n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \\n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \\n Nov 15th (current drop)= 7 day drop -17.2% followed by a ????  \\n \\n\\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.8 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \\n Average % for the drop= -17.8% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \\n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \\n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \\n \\n\\nso what does this tell us? \\n\\nWith todays new low we are now at day 7 of dropping and -17.2%. We are right at the average length of the drops before we see some upside. \\n\\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 166.19 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 185.82 by Tuesday that 29th. \\n\\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \\n\\nSo again all this show us is that Tesla is following the cycle. With FOMC minutes tomorrow though that could be a wild card but I overall expect some upside on tesla the rest of the week. \\n\\nOverall 168 to 170 has now built itself as a nice support area here and we could see a push back up tomorrow to test that blue falling wedge resistance at 170. So unless tesla opens red tomorrow and never sees green it will break that blue falling wedge resistance which should provide a push up to at least 175-180. \\n\\nHowever, if Tesla loses 168 tomorrow then I will be looking for 162.5 which is the red falling wedge support line. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yg1z6kzlel1a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74aa4ce1ee5690d8a54846320d36ba10ba2b560\\n\\nThe VIX is still on a mission to break back into the teens it appears. I am a little surprised to not see a slight move up on the VIX today with FOMC minutes tomorrow but perhaps that comes in the morning which does seem to be the trend lately. The VIX also gap filled the August 19th 21.27 gap now (well it hit a low of 21.28 today which is one penny from being gap filled). With the VIX touching 21.3 and dumping even further away form its daily 8ema I would be eyeing 19.7 next which is where the VIX hit in August before the “top” was put in and we started our next leg down. \\n\\n**Daily log-**\\n\\nBeing that I was gone all day and had a nice win on my SPY calls I decided not to even attempt to trade anything in the morning before I left. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6flvk0nmel1a1.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2240011acd75d28663bad3f911f482b93fb16763\\n\\nOverall a green day today and this green day turned my week back to a green week which is always nice.

Looks like VOLD was behaving nicely today and overall the technical were pretty solid. Kinda sad I missed today but in the end family is always over money/ trading. \\n\\nTomorrow we get FOMC minutes and while its not guaranteed a big mover or big day this one with the fed pivot narrative and deciding what rate hike for next meeting could bring some good movement. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzqqhu4jel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=167a8c87e0d955e14f20c3786f769e17f9c4bfe4\\n\\nQuite a lot going on today technical wise. We did confirm that daily 8ema as support once again and if you remember I had suspected with the doji candle and closure over that key 394.7 support that we would see a bounce today. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i03j7jnjel1a1.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0b420fbf1bd2fee7d7535d183b65d11c8e02c2\\n\\nMy 0dte calls paid out nicely and made it worth missing the whole day today. \\n\\nNow today we see that we did break through that diamond pattern on SPY daily. This should open us up to some more upside and we also closed over that key 398.5 resistance. The next major support is 401.2 followed by 405.4. With FOMC minutes tomorrow and a lot of fed speakers I really don’t expect much bullish movement and the minutes are going to reconfirm just how hawkish jpow is right now. The keys level we need to watch is 398.5 and 401.2 tomorrow. Those will be our gateways. Also if we do close over 401.2 then we would be closing over the daily 200ema and that really would be a bullish sign. \\n\\nAt this point there isn’t a big reason to short SPY until we close back under the daily 8ema. But again as I have said going long (think 30-60dte) here also seems like FOMO and chasing. Best thing to do here is to pay the short term. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d5k748kel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f2ddf776549b8a693987ea7cb0e65665af364c\\n\\nFutures also broke its diamond pattern but instead of showing you that again here I am going to show you this rising wedge that is on futures and SPYs daily chart. This is very key to watch and could lead us to a touch of the 2022 bear market resistance line (the thicker green line) and this could be the pattern to watch to show the next leg down. \\n\\nWith a closure over 4000 now and breaking the 3955 to 4000 consolidation period we naturally will be looking for the upside here. Key resistance is the daily 200ema at 4028 followed by 4060 and 4090. Key support is now 4010 and 3955. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0capz6qkel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba4aabadb510fbf98d3ce4a4930292c15c658c29\\n\\nTesla did make a new low today despite closing green. I posted some analyzed data on tesla with its drops and pops so lets update these now and see what they show…\\n\\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \\n\\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \\n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \\n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \\n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \\n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \\n Nov 15th (current drop)= 7 day drop -17.2% followed by a ????  \\n \\n\\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.8 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \\n Average % for the drop= -17.8% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \\n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \\n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \\n \\n\\nso what does this tell us? \\n\\nWith todays new low we are now at day 7 of dropping and -17.2%. We are right at the average length of the drops before we see some upside. \\n\\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 166.19 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 185.82 by Tuesday that 29th. \\n\\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \\n\\nSo again all this show us is that Tesla is following the cycle. With FOMC minutes tomorrow though that could be a wild card but I overall expect some upside on tesla the rest of the week. \\n\\nOverall 168 to 170 has now built itself as a nice support area here and we could see a push back up tomorrow to test that blue falling wedge resistance at 170. So unless tesla opens red tomorrow and never sees green it will break that blue falling wedge resistance which should provide a push up to at least 175-180. \\n\\nHowever, if Tesla loses 168 tomorrow then I will be looking for 162.5 which is the red falling wedge support line. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yg1z6kzlel1a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74aa4ce1ee5690d8a54846320d36ba10ba2b560\\n\\nThe VIX is still on a mission to break back into the teens it appears. I am a little surprised to not see a slight move up on the VIX today with FOMC minutes tomorrow but perhaps that comes in the morning which does seem to be the trend lately. The VIX also gap filled the August 19th 21.27 gap now (well it hit a low of 21.28 today which is one penny from being gap filled). With the VIX touching 21.3 and dumping even further away form its daily 8ema I would be eyeing 19.7 next which is where the VIX hit in August before the “top” was put in and we started our next leg down. \\n\\n**Daily log-**\\n\\nBeing that I was gone all day and had a nice win on my SPY calls I decided not to even attempt to trade anything in the morning before I left. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6flvk0nmel1a1.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2240011acd75d28663bad3f911f482b93fb16763\\n\\nOverall a green day today and this green day turned my week back to a green week which is always nice.

The volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched. I had extreme flash backs to June and July where SPY was so irrational it was untradeable.

Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. \\n\\nSo we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. \\n\\nThis next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. \\n\\nWednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfrxzj5hpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=191381b89207ff63d8075f2910dae56ddf47af39\\n\\nLast week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. \\n\\nThe bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. \\n\\nWe closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. \\n\\nThe issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. \\n\\nBears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. \\n\\nKey support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1\\n\\nKey resistance-398.5 -&gt; 401.3 \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/feysfrohpd1a1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97068f6a4b52222fe178cb484f3dc4dbead51708\\n\\nFutures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart.

There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4dh1vnipd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7488b50427a19e5bfa3253f3bf0b131cbce538fb\\n\\nOut of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one.

This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. \\n\\nInterestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. \\n\\nThis is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? \\n\\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \\n\\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \\n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \\n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \\n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \\n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \\n Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  \\n \\n\\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \\n Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \\n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \\n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \\n \\n\\nso what does this tell us? \\n\\nWell being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. \\n\\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. \\n\\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6ebxazkpd1a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2a2eda88760c96bf81025455f1a886dc4b406f7\\n\\nThere was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… \\n\\nLets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. \\n\\nThat means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \\n\\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \\n\\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpi4leflpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f9b70d177ac87572352e1dbb896d87c7b3dee7a\\n\\n**Daily Log-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddjqa6ylpd1a1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c9c19c0d6b703e697bb85085b2781da8363bacf\\n\\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. \\n\\nFrom there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. \\n\\nA red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. \\n\\nHOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… \\n\\nAnyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. \\n\\nPeople really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. \\n\\nLong story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!  \\n \\n\\nYoutube will be up later!  \\n \\n\\nReminder I will NOT be trading tomorrow so no pre-market tomorrow morning and I wont be trading at all tomorrow… busy day with the kids and some other appointments.', title='11-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', upvote_ratio=1.0, created=1669069024.0, d_={'created_utc': 1669069024, 'id': 'z1c41u', 'selftext': 'That was probably one of the worst days to trade that I have seen in months.

But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly.

Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. \\n\\nSo we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. \\n\\nThis next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. \\n\\nWednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5xi71r1pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd25445934bf30c154e82ccfc8a3e4748237ae2\\n\\nLast week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. \\n\\nThe bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. \\n\\nWe closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. \\n\\nThe issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. \\n\\nBears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. \\n\\nKey support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1\\n\\nKey resistance-398.5 -&gt; 401.3 \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd36vx92pd1a1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=396f25d3cd980dd3b7e8bd4dc9e4a0b67726cee2\\n\\nFutures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldx9cvo2pd1a1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=873731cea7a0a60e46380165c67173b12953c78f\\n\\nI removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80xggb73pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64896086e827bf648afbf44f81a6aa1f7095f107\\n\\nOut of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. \\n\\nBack to futures now.   \\n key support- 3960 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3910  \\n key resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4028\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sf6qwq3pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b39094fc909d3cd38857b8dc2c5d2f995d8d8e\\n\\nZooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them.

This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. \\n\\nInterestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. \\n\\nThis is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? \\n\\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \\n\\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \\n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \\n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \\n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \\n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \\n Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  \\n \\n\\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \\n Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \\n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \\n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \\n \\n\\nso what does this tell us? \\n\\nWell being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. \\n\\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. \\n\\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9xsyts4pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff94f8f4eac7e7a71196af9a9f8b3401b61ff1a\\n\\nThere was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… \\n\\nLets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. \\n\\nThat means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \\n\\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \\n\\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkxyvk95pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82cecb10759e894a90da574552d642ae1c4457f7\\n\\n**Daily Log-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ske2fn5pd1a1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5535b03f194bdbafab71b82160cfedf0760141f3\\n\\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again).

I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \\n\\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \\n\\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkxyvk95pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82cecb10759e894a90da574552d642ae1c4457f7\\n\\n**Daily Log-**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ske2fn5pd1a1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5535b03f194bdbafab71b82160cfedf0760141f3\\n\\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. \\n\\nFrom there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. \\n\\nA red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. \\n\\nHOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… \\n\\nAnyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. \\n\\nPeople really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. \\n\\nLong story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!  \\n \\n\\nYoutube will be up later!  \\n \\n\\nReminder I will NOT be trading tomorrow so no pre-market tomorrow morning and I wont be trading at all tomorrow… busy day with the kids and some other appointments.', 'title': '11-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'created': 1669068872.0}),\n",

It's part of an increasingly urgent priority of the U.S. government: lessening dependence on China for critical minerals that are vital in everything from civilian goods such as\\xa0electronics, cars and batteries, to weapons.  \\nIt illustrates how Canadian mining is becoming the nexus of a colossal geopolitical struggle. Ottawa just pushed [Chinese state-owned companies](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-critical-minerals-plan-1.6634386) out of the sector, and the U.S. is now considering moving public funding in.  \\nThe American military has a new pot of money at its disposal to help private companies inaugurate new mining projects; it's for funding feasibility studies, plant renovations, battery-recycling\\xa0and worker training.\\xa0  \\nPresident Joe Biden invoked the 1950\\xa0[Defense Production Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2989973/defense-production-act-title-iii-presidential-determination-for-critical-materi/) to expand the domestic mining sector, and the military received [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/climate-bill-canada-minerals-1.6551920)\\xa0to implement it. This whirlwind of activity was prompted by a [White House study](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf) last year warning that dependence on certain foreign-made products represents a national security risk to the U.S., and it cited semiconductors, batteries, medicines and 53 types of minerals including **graphite**. [Read More](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends/79e1ed40-64eb-11ed-b7c5-8e0d74f3ac48/preview)....   \\n**Why Graphite is Important**  \\n\\n\\nDespite boasting a large EV market, the US does not produce any natural graphite and must rely solely on imports to satisfy domestic demand. The level of foreign dependence has increased over the years, with the US importing 38,900 tonnes of graphite in 2016, followed by 70,700 tonnes in 2018. According to the USGS, in 2020 the US imported 42,000 tonnes, of which 71% was high-purity flake graphite, 28% was amorphous, and 1% was lump and chip graphite. The top importers were China (33%), Mexico (23%), Canada (17%) and India (9%).  \\n\\n\\nBut remember, the US is not 33% dependent on China for its battery-grade graphite, but 100%, since China controls all the spherical graphite processing. Such a level of dependence can be considered both unsustainable and uneconomical. It’s also important to consider the environmental ramifications of persisting with China as the go-to graphite source.

It's part of an increasingly urgent priority of the U.S. government: lessening dependence on China for critical minerals that are vital in everything from civilian goods such as\\xa0electronics, cars and batteries, to weapons.  \\nIt illustrates how Canadian mining is becoming the nexus of a colossal geopolitical struggle. Ottawa just pushed [Chinese state-owned companies](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-critical-minerals-plan-1.6634386) out of the sector, and the U.S. is now considering moving public funding in.  \\nThe American military has a new pot of money at its disposal to help private companies inaugurate new mining projects; it's for funding feasibility studies, plant renovations, battery-recycling\\xa0and worker training.\\xa0  \\nPresident Joe Biden invoked the 1950\\xa0[Defense Production Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2989973/defense-production-act-title-iii-presidential-determination-for-critical-materi/) to expand the domestic mining sector, and the military received [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/climate-bill-canada-minerals-1.6551920)\\xa0to implement it. This whirlwind of activity was prompted by a [White House study](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf) last year warning that dependence on certain foreign-made products represents a national security risk to the U.S., and it cited semiconductors, batteries, medicines and 53 types of minerals including **graphite**. [Read More](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends/79e1ed40-64eb-11ed-b7c5-8e0d74f3ac48/preview)....   \\n**Why Graphite is Important**  \\n\\n\\nDespite boasting a large EV market, the US does not produce any natural graphite and must rely solely on imports to satisfy domestic demand. The level of foreign dependence has increased over the years, with the US importing 38,900 tonnes of graphite in 2016, followed by 70,700 tonnes in 2018. According to the USGS, in 2020 the US imported 42,000 tonnes, of which 71% was high-purity flake graphite, 28% was amorphous, and 1% was lump and chip graphite. The top importers were China (33%), Mexico (23%), Canada (17%) and India (9%).  \\n\\n\\nBut remember, the US is not 33% dependent on China for its battery-grade graphite, but 100%, since China controls all the spherical graphite processing. Such a level of dependence can be considered both unsustainable and uneconomical. It’s also important to consider the environmental ramifications of persisting with China as the go-to graphite source. Coal still dominates China’s energy mix, meaning the carbon footprint of all products, including synthetic graphite, is quite high.  \\n\\n\\nOne study found that producing 1 kg of synthetic graphite releases 4.9 kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, whereas for natural graphite the CO2 emission is 1-2 kg.

This was actually a super bearish close today and shows a local top in my opinion. It will take some big strength to push through 400 that is for sure. \\n\\nWith this black bull channel we actually have a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow. Not sure exactly how low we will go but until we can break through and close over 400 there is not a reason to expect further upside. \\n\\nKey support- 393.1 -&gt; 390.1 (key level support) \\n\\nKey resistance- 398.6 -&gt; 402\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l6llij7zhzz91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7646a43193bf7f584230ac459422274c4c8ad4\\n\\nIdentical pattern on futures right now too… we actually came close enough on Futures to the daily 200ema to call that a daily 200ema rejection and again with these gravestone doji candles I expect this to be the local top and to see a back test of some stronger support levels like 390/ 3905 before we have a fighting chance of continuing up. \\n\\nSupport- 3925 -&gt; 3905 -&gt; 3863\\n\\nResistance- 4028 -&gt; 4060\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hf8z54qzhzz91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b89ec1b050ba73a72566ac9e698b33028a9039\\n\\nApple ran right into its daily 100ema today, however, found itself running into a brick wall and has now retraced pretty significantly.

I had said last week that the 196.1 double top was in play and it sure was today. With this doji I do expect some downside tomorrow. IT did however find itself holding key support of 190.9 EOD. I will look for that support to break tomorrow and test the blue support line at 188. If we lose that support I am looking for 177.4 support retest this week.

Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. \\n\\nSo Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. \\n\\nTesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. \\n\\nPeople love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. \\n\\nCheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. \\n\\nFord has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m.

They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. \\n\\nTesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. \\n\\nSo the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%.

As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. \\n\\nI wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. \\n\\nJanuary the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  \\n April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   \\n August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.\\n\\nThat means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at 401.6 and find out rejection point there. This actually is exactly where we rejected in august on the dead cat bounce. \\n\\nThis COULD give us a trajectory of about 339.4 sometime between December 1st and December 20th. However, my one caveat here is the million dollar question “what would the catalyst for such a drop be?” Earnings is over, no cpi/ fomc until December 13th/ 14th and more or less there isn’t much I can for see that could panic people enough to sell that intensely. \\n\\nSo if we break the trend and we let the FG index run hotter than usual the next question is “where are we going? How high are we going to go?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0byl8v7iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6526517148b713a6e8f9d5b1479a461453f70ef4\\n\\nLooking at the daily chart I see a bull and a bear case. Bull case would be that we push minimally to the 200ema at 401.6. If we can CLOSE a daily candle over that 200ema then I have no doubt next week we could test 405.4 channel resistance and we very well could end up testing that bigger solid green resistance line for the overall 2022 bear channel. This resistance on Friday is 410.8. \\n\\nHowever, if we either reject the 200ema or from here here double top and see downside the first stop is going to be 390. This is the level that bulls need to defend. If they lose 390 then we are looking at a pretty convincing minimally partial gap fill to 381.14. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkrafse8iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf2c3a225eaf8f4605823c4dae5e1717f1881da\\n\\nNow if we flip over to the weekly view things become a little more clear. We dead stopped into the weekly 100ema today and couldn’t break through that. We have a nice blue bull channel formed here and a pretty mild black rising wedge also. \\n\\nNext weeks key resistance comes in at 399.5. This will be our pivot point. Break out over it and hold that as support through the week and we are looking at a test of the WEEKLY bear channel resistance at 412.7 next week. However, if we reject and form a double top here at the weekly 100ema we could be looking for that backtest of 390. Same with the daily if we lose 390 then we will look for a bigger retrace. \\n\\nI am pretty indifferent here in the fact that I don’t see a catalyst to make people want to sell at these levels. Most investors are probs thinking “bottoms in” and they don’t wanna miss the next bull run. It will take a lot to convince them to sell. However, Spy just put its greenest week in since the week of June 21st. There definitely could be at minimum some profit taking and with the VIX unwinding we could see some people start hedging for next CPI/ FOMC. \\n\\nFor me I wouldn’t take a long here but I feel until we touch the 200ema its too early to start a put position.  \\n\\nKey support- 390 -&gt; 375.8\\n\\nKey resistance- 399.5 -&gt; 409\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsh6qf19iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37480d73ed532dbcf135bcbc441cd0d4c96b2ccb\\n\\nSimilar case here on the Futures daily we haven’t quite touched that key 200ema yet which is the gateway for the next big run up or the potential for the next top. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pckivin9iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dfefe3d32067d209c5c88a44bf8c63958271866\\n\\nWhen we look at futures weekly chart you can see this is actually a true weekly bullish engulfing candle. This should provide some upside for next week from a technical standpoint. However, we need to take out that weekly 100ema first. We are also well above that 3870 JPM collar call too. \\n\\nSupport- 3915 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705\\n\\nResistance- 4000 -&gt; 4085 -&gt; 4152 (bear market resistance… 3.8% from close) \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gujyi6aiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360b546b00bd44331a7b88507f0de893810f1228\\n\\nApple put that 135 support in this week and from here this thing has never looked back. I believe it will test that bear channel resistance next week. Apple fell just short of its 100ema and 200ema this week which as I have mentioned before on Apple is always a period of consolidation. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v0exaraiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31939546e40711ce5d2787140850194ebbc40942\\n\\nThe weekly on Apple actually is still trading within an overall bear channel. That resistance comes in at 151.9 next week. If we see Apple break through that level then it has broken its bear channel and we can look for further upside. Apple did close back over its 8ema but fell just short of its 20/50ema. \\n\\nKey support- 147.2 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2\\n\\nKey resistance- 150.5 -&gt; 151.9 -&gt; 155.8\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p063lc9biez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2db46ba341aa1896eb847429b9cec3b2700ce0a6\\n\\nTesla mostly due to its sporadic movement the last few weeks has quite a few things set up on it. It has the bigger red falling wedge formed on it that has a tighter falling wedge with that black resistance line within it. There is also a potential recovery support line highlighted in blue. \\n\\nTesla did come up today and get near the daily 8ema but failed to close over it today it also came within 14 cents from the November 7th 196.66 gap fill. I am keeping an eye out for a double top Monday at the daily 8ema which also would coincide with the back resistance line at 196.8. As long as we hold under that resistance line there should be downside expected. However, once we break through that resistance then I would expect a test of possibly the daily 20ema (especially if the markets remain bullish). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bh9pavbiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fca84522336e34f5b4b1127819a44f38bf570a2\\n\\nI actually remain bearish on tesla, however, looking at the weekly it broke under the weekly 200ema as I had said for the first time in 3 years, however, it popped and closed over it. With this huge hanging man candle here there actually is a pretty solid case for upside next week. The weekly bear channel resistance will be 211.1 and will also be the weekly 8ema. \\n\\nKey support- 195.8 -&gt; 177.8 -&gt; 167.9\\n\\nKey resistance- 207.3 -&gt; 228.6\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hyg1mbzciez91.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07afd85e27a9d363318b1eff870b95193e5597e\\n\\nThe VIX has now closed below 23.5 support for the first time since the days before the September CPI reading. This also is the lowest reading the VIX has closed at since August 26th which was Jackson Hole. \\n\\nThis kinda goes even further to prove my point that I don’t see a bearish catalyst for this market. IF we look at the last two times the VIX was at these levels there was bearish catalysts that pushed it back up. Jackson hole and then CPI. But with no big fed events, no cpi and no FOMC for another month what is going to be the catalyst? What is going to be the reason the VIX wants to spike? \\n\\nThere might not be one for the next month. If there is no catalyst we might be looking at the VIX going back to that support line from the August low at 19.7. For me this is where we open a longer 30-60dte put position. We are in no mans land right now. Going short is fighting the trend but going long on calls feels like we are buying the absolutely top. \\n\\nRemember guys… CASH is a position! We don’t always have to be long. We can be cash over night. We can play some short 7-14 dte plays and wait for the next top/ bottom to more clearly present itself. \\n\\n$5k/ 10% challenge- \\n\\nOfficially went live with this challenge today. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kj196eodiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80d71b1a1eb78fbf42f4d8c15814297264ae8356\\n\\nI will do weekly updates on this but also include it in my daily log. The general idea here is I will be using $5,000 for ONE trade per day.. the goal is 10% profits BUT a hard set -20% stop loss. We will see where this takes us and if we can make one trade a day for about 10% profitable or not. On the right side you can see I broke it down in an equivalent had you used a smaller account instead of my $5,000. \\n\\nDaily log- \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvf9xcgeiez91.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc6a3aa673c08c15c8c0ff848c07ab526001369\\n\\nOverall this was a pretty great week. My most profitable week ever I believe and I also secured my biggest win ever this week with that CPI play. However, I recognize while that was a high probability play… if I was wrong and we opened flat I woulda closed my week out red. \\n\\nI also made some mistakes this week. I let a few of my level to level puts run way too long and pass my 25% stop loss. Still a struggle but letting the SPY put from yesterday run to today for -82.32% and taking a bigger -60%+ loss on Tesla earlier in the week really hit me hard. \\n\\nThis week I absolutely KILLED it on scalps hitting 95% win rate and a nice $4,889. I had mentioned last week and earlier this week whether or not tesla plays were worth it or not.

As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. \\n\\nI wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. \\n\\nJanuary the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  \\n April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   \\n August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.\\n\\nThat means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at 401.6 and find out rejection point there. This actually is exactly where we rejected in august on the dead cat bounce. \\n\\nThis COULD give us a trajectory of about 339.4 sometime between December 1st and December 20th. However, my one caveat here is the million dollar question “what would the catalyst for such a drop be?” Earnings is over, no cpi/ fomc until December 13th/ 14th and more or less there isn’t much I can for see that could panic people enough to sell that intensely. \\n\\nSo if we break the trend and we let the FG index run hotter than usual the next question is “where are we going? How high are we going to go?”\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0byl8v7iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6526517148b713a6e8f9d5b1479a461453f70ef4\\n\\nLooking at the daily chart I see a bull and a bear case. Bull case would be that we push minimally to the 200ema at 401.6. If we can CLOSE a daily candle over that 200ema then I have no doubt next week we could test 405.4 channel resistance and we very well could end up testing that bigger solid green resistance line for the overall 2022 bear channel. This resistance on Friday is 410.8. \\n\\nHowever, if we either reject the 200ema or from here here double top and see downside the first stop is going to be 390. This is the level that bulls need to defend. If they lose 390 then we are looking at a pretty convincing minimally partial gap fill to 381.14. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkrafse8iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf2c3a225eaf8f4605823c4dae5e1717f1881da\\n\\nNow if we flip over to the weekly view things become a little more clear. We dead stopped into the weekly 100ema today and couldn’t break through that. We have a nice blue bull channel formed here and a pretty mild black rising wedge also. \\n\\nNext weeks key resistance comes in at 399.5. This will be our pivot point. Break out over it and hold that as support through the week and we are looking at a test of the WEEKLY bear channel resistance at 412.7 next week. However, if we reject and form a double top here at the weekly 100ema we could be looking for that backtest of 390. Same with the daily if we lose 390 then we will look for a bigger retrace. \\n\\nI am pretty indifferent here in the fact that I don’t see a catalyst to make people want to sell at these levels. Most investors are probs thinking “bottoms in” and they don’t wanna miss the next bull run. It will take a lot to convince them to sell. However, Spy just put its greenest week in since the week of June 21st. There definitely could be at minimum some profit taking and with the VIX unwinding we could see some people start hedging for next CPI/ FOMC. \\n\\nFor me I wouldn’t take a long here but I feel until we touch the 200ema its too early to start a put position.  \\n\\nKey support- 390 -&gt; 375.8\\n\\nKey resistance- 399.5 -&gt; 409\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsh6qf19iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37480d73ed532dbcf135bcbc441cd0d4c96b2ccb\\n\\nSimilar case here on the Futures daily we haven’t quite touched that key 200ema yet which is the gateway for the next big run up or the potential for the next top. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pckivin9iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dfefe3d32067d209c5c88a44bf8c63958271866\\n\\nWhen we look at futures weekly chart you can see this is actually a true weekly bullish engulfing candle. This should provide some upside for next week from a technical standpoint. However, we need to take out that weekly 100ema first. We are also well above that 3870 JPM collar call too. \\n\\nSupport- 3915 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705\\n\\nResistance- 4000 -&gt; 4085 -&gt; 4152 (bear market resistance… 3.8% from close) \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gujyi6aiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360b546b00bd44331a7b88507f0de893810f1228\\n\\nApple put that 135 support in this week and from here this thing has never looked back. I believe it will test that bear channel resistance next week. Apple fell just short of its 100ema and 200ema this week which as I have mentioned before on Apple is always a period of consolidation. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v0exaraiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31939546e40711ce5d2787140850194ebbc40942\\n\\nThe weekly on Apple actually is still trading within an overall bear channel. That resistance comes in at 151.9 next week. If we see Apple break through that level then it has broken its bear channel and we can look for further upside. Apple did close back over its 8ema but fell just short of its 20/50ema. \\n\\nKey support- 147.2 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2\\n\\nKey resistance- 150.5 -&gt; 151.9 -&gt; 155.8\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p063lc9biez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2db46ba341aa1896eb847429b9cec3b2700ce0a6\\n\\nTesla mostly due to its sporadic movement the last few weeks has quite a few things set up on it. It has the bigger red falling wedge formed on it that has a tighter falling wedge with that black resistance line within it. There is also a potential recovery support line highlighted in blue. \\n\\nTesla did come up today and get near the daily 8ema but failed to close over it today it also came within 14 cents from the November 7th 196.66 gap fill. I am keeping an eye out for a double top Monday at the daily 8ema which also would coincide with the back resistance line at 196.8. As long as we hold under that resistance line there should be downside expected. However, once we break through that resistance then I would expect a test of possibly the daily 20ema (especially if the markets remain bullish). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bh9pavbiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fca84522336e34f5b4b1127819a44f38bf570a2\\n\\nI actually remain bearish on tesla, however, looking at the weekly it broke under the weekly 200ema as I had said for the first time in 3 years, however, it popped and closed over it. With this huge hanging man candle here there actually is a pretty solid case for upside next week. The weekly bear channel resistance will be 211.1 and will also be the weekly 8ema. \\n\\nKey support- 195.8 -&gt; 177.8 -&gt; 167.9\\n\\nKey resistance- 207.3 -&gt; 228.6\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hyg1mbzciez91.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07afd85e27a9d363318b1eff870b95193e5597e\\n\\nThe VIX has now closed below 23.5 support for the first time since the days before the September CPI reading. This also is the lowest reading the VIX has closed at since August 26th which was Jackson Hole. \\n\\nThis kinda goes even further to prove my point that I don’t see a bearish catalyst for this market. IF we look at the last two times the VIX was at these levels there was bearish catalysts that pushed it back up. Jackson hole and then CPI. But with no big fed events, no cpi and no FOMC for another month what is going to be the catalyst? What is going to be the reason the VIX wants to spike? \\n\\nThere might not be one for the next month. If there is no catalyst we might be looking at the VIX going back to that support line from the August low at 19.7. For me this is where we open a longer 30-60dte put position. We are in no mans land right now. Going short is fighting the trend but going long on calls feels like we are buying the absolutely top. \\n\\nRemember guys… CASH is a position! We don’t always have to be long. We can be cash over night. We can play some short 7-14 dte plays and wait for the next top/ bottom to more clearly present itself. \\n\\n$5k/ 10% challenge- \\n\\nOfficially went live with this challenge today. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kj196eodiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80d71b1a1eb78fbf42f4d8c15814297264ae8356\\n\\nI will do weekly updates on this but also include it in my daily log. The general idea here is I will be using $5,000 for ONE trade per day.. the goal is 10% profits BUT a hard set -20% stop loss. We will see where this takes us and if we can make one trade a day for about 10% profitable or not. On the right side you can see I broke it down in an equivalent had you used a smaller account instead of my $5,000. \\n\\nDaily log- \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvf9xcgeiez91.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abc6a3aa673c08c15c8c0ff848c07ab526001369\\n\\nOverall this was a pretty great week. My most profitable week ever I believe and I also secured my biggest win ever this week with that CPI play. However, I recognize while that was a high probability play… if I was wrong and we opened flat I woulda closed my week out red. \\n\\nI also made some mistakes this week. I let a few of my level to level puts run way too long and pass my 25% stop loss. Still a struggle but letting the SPY put from yesterday run to today for -82.32% and taking a bigger -60%+ loss on Tesla earlier in the week really hit me hard. \\n\\nThis week I absolutely KILLED it on scalps hitting 95% win rate and a nice $4,889. I had mentioned last week and earlier this week whether or not tesla plays were worth it or not. In review you can see that my win rate was much lower on them, however, profitability wise I actually was very successful. Something some fail to remember is that win rate doesn’t always equal profits. For this week low win rate still netted profits. \\n\\nI am always learning and always critiquing my strategy.

Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI “came down” we have to deal with yet again the “fed pivot/ slowing” news media cycles hitting the tapes. \\n\\nOverall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me0yb2c1m7z91.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8021b8c5066f855c1dea3a9c8e926fdf307d3031\\n\\nSPY just made yet again market history… today was the 3rd largest daily point gain in market history, the 2nd largest intraday points swing, and the largest daily percent change this year (bear or bull). This was the largest green close since march 23rd 2009 which closed up 7.08%. \\n\\nWhat an incredible and unbelievable day. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxzosz19m7z91.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8de2862429b1ff4b94c9a343156e473c42850fff\\n\\nWe impressively broke through the daily rising wedge support last night at market close (now that makes a new support) and today we just touched and held the resistance of that same rising wedge. That is one hell of a swing and I cant even believe it myself. We also went from close in the bear channel to now closing in the purple channel completely skipping the green channel close. \\n\\nIf the market is being rational it is going to come down and at least test 390 purple channel support. There could be a case for it to come all the way down to 384 or even 381.1 to gap fill. However, with the extreme volume on VOLD today and just the overall momentum I wouldn’t be surprised (despite it being illogical) to see tomorrow be yet another big green day. \\n\\nSupport- 393 -&gt; 390 -&gt; 388 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 381.1\\n\\nResistance- 397.9 -&gt; 402 (daily 200ema) \\n\\nSomething I would like to point out is that this day is very similar to May 4th on SPY. That was a FOMC day that went on a similar insane rip EOD and end up with a flat top daily candle much like SPYS today. That day resulted in a massive drop the next day. Something interesting about this also is that the VIX put its biggest drop of the year in since May 4th today also.

Resistance of this channel is 397.6 (this is a potential place we could pop to tomorrow before retracing). We also have a rising wedge inside this bull channel to keep an eye on too. Next week 2022 bear channel resistance comes in at 412.7.

The biggest thing that happened today is that it failed to make a new daily low for the first time since October 31st. Many (me included) have been waiting for the bounce on telsa that just never came. We just might be looking at that bounce right now. With 190.9 clearly being resistance on Tesla we very well may be looking at our double top rejection. This daily hammer candle very well could result in a double top and further sell off tomorrow. \\n\\nBiggest thing to watch for tomorrow is whether Tesla closes below 188.3 or not which is the weekly 200ema. \\n\\nSupport- 186.7 -&gt; 177.4\\n\\nResistance- 194.3 -&gt; 197 -&gt; 201.8\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymho6u65m7z91.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acf6fbc4f34afcd9ec6fc7630d3d9ff571c7d3f9\\n\\nPretty impressive candle on the daily chart here for the VIX. The biggest drop as I said since May 4th. While the VIX was in much different levels back then something that is VERY intriguing to me is that today we dropped to about 22.84 and recoiled and the VIX closed right at that key 23.5 support level. I am a little surprised to see that on a 5.5% green day for SPY. Actually I am surprised that the VIX didn’t drop more like 15% especially when you consider that on big red days for CPI or other events we can see a 12-20% green day on the VIX. \\n\\nThis 23.5 level is a big level. The VIX could be hinting to us that the markets are not as bullish as this rally today wants us to believe. I will be watching for a double bottom pop on the VIX tomorrow. \\n\\n**Where am I at right now? Bearish or bullish ?**\\n\\nTo be honest we couldn’t have had a worse outcome today. A beat on CPI just leads to even more speculation from the markets that the Fed is going to pivot/ slow rate hikes next meeting. However, the thing is that MoM inflation did not come down and while yes these were “beats” under expectation and under previous its hard to say after one good reading that we beat inflation. With SPY now being over the 75% retracement line of the bear channel the risk to reward to run calls up here is very low. However, this rally could last too long and we may never see an actual drop to pay out on puts now. I don’t forsee until next CPI/ FOMC any thing big enough to actually put the markets in sell off mode. While I do think we pullback a little just to naturally fill some of this wildness I don’t think itll be too sustained. But playing calls up here just seems like playing with fire too. We are definitely in a short term play area right now.\\n\\nHowever, lets keep this in mind… \\n\\nCPI YoY- 7.7% puts us at the lowest reading since February which was 7.5%.  \\n CPI MoM- 0.4% was under forecast but was the same as previous… that means inflation is still increasing… don’t get this confused… we did not DECREASE inflation… it just didn’t go up as much…  \\n CORE YoY- 6.3% is a decrease but only puts us back at September CORE of 6.3%. that means we saw core go up for one month and then come back down to the previous months numbers.   \\n CORE MoM- 0.3% means after two back to back months of 0.6% MoM CORE we did finally decrease….   \\n \\n\\nNow here is something that I already have on my radar and will be doing a lot of data diving into to figure out the best play for next CPI/ FOMC which is back to back (thinking we can really nail a banger). \\n\\nLets chat really quickly to put it on our radars about the August drop in CPI and the august rally (mind you this is the ONLY other “beat” on cpi all year). \\n\\nIn August CPI YoY beat at 8.5% coming down 0.2% form forecast and an impressive 0.6% from previous. The interesting thing about this prediction was that the forecast was so far below the previous with the 0.2% variance it woulda been incredible if we missed. Interestingly enough the following reading for September came in 0.2% over forecast of 8.1% but WAS a beat and decrease. Looking at the numbers for CPI YoY we have now had 5 readings in a row of CPI YoY decreasing… \\n\\nCPI MoM in august was forecasted at 0.2% and came in at 0%. This is the closest we have been to a decrease in inflation all year but we have still NOT gotten an actual negative reading for MoM. After the August 0% reading we had 0.1% -&gt; 0.4% and now we have 0.4% again. So despite a BEAT of forecast CPI MoM has actually not seen a decrease to match CPI YoY. \\n\\nSince August CORE YoY of 5.9% which actually wasn’t even a beat from previous it was unchanged we had a 6.3% and now a 6.6% reading on YoY core. This reading was 0.2% beat from forecast and a 0.3% beat from previous. From the April CORE 6.5% reading until August we did see a decrease/ unchanged on core YoY. I will be closely watching to see if CORE YoY can unwind again or if we are going to go up. \\n\\nCore MoM was 0.3% in august which was a pretty impressive beat from the previous 0.7%. Much like CPI Mom we have not had a negative reading yet and we have not by any means tamed inflation but there has been slowing of CORE MoM unlike CPI MoM.\\n\\nI am seeing a pretty big potential where we COULD get another good reading on inflation in December actually. Again everything comes down to the forecast. As long as the forecast comes in 0.2% below current actual readings so that would be forecast of CPI 7.5, CPI MoM 0.2, CORE 6.1 and CORE MoM 0.1% we actually could see another impressive beat and our first back to back green CPI days of the year. \\n\\nNow do I believe in real world that inflation is tamed? Absolutely not… no way… shit is so expensive its not funny and yeah used cars have come down (sucks more then It helps) new cars have not come down to match that used car drop. The biggest thing to watch for CPI on December 13th is 1. Will CPI YoY give its 5th consecutive drop, 2. Will CPI MoM and CORE MoM give their first negative readings (showing an actual decrease not just being unchanged) and 3. Will CORE cpi start the trend of coming down again.\\n\\nThe crazy bull case would be that we get back to back good readings on CPI come December 13th and then on December 14th while we still most likely get a 50bps this COULD give JPOW the fuel he needs to finally say the magical words to the market of “we are ready to slow hikes at the next meeting and see the full effect of our rate hikes.” A hinting at 25bps would be an pretty bullish thing and we could end up seeing December 13th and 14th turn into some impressively green two day rally based on that news. I will keep you guys posted and of course post a full trade plan and analysis/ breakdown for those two days.\\n\\nDaily log- \\n\\nToday for me was an amazing day and for many in the server who played the strangle or amazingly played calls only the payout was phenomenal. After the morning win I did open one lotto put pretty early when things started to look heavy and that we wouldn’t take out 390 today, however, that quickly got wrecked. It was worth the risk to reward as I wouldn’t have in my wildest dreams expected a 5.5% green day on spy today. I am shocked we broke through 390 and that we kept pushing EOD even higher. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngrx9vnam7z91.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7d841f6a0f4b11e940aab865329aaecc229a7\\n\\nI played a few level to level plays on SPY but I couldn’t bring myself to scalp today. For me when we are at such an extreme and as much as I want to trust it to continue I struggle to believe in my plays which makes me struggle to believe in myself and I end up cutting early or cutting red when I shouldn’t have. Days like today are better left untraded for me. \\n\\nTomorrow is going to be interesting to say the least. I wouldn’t put it past markets to not even look back and just straight push to gap fill 403 tomorrow but I more sensibly expect a 384 to 390 pullback. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7evcs3bm7z91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dfad88f36cd2f08317f978d283e8744654988c3\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auprmpnbm7z91.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec6a146eacc30179c28ba3a3b8a04f8bce32800', title='11-10-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', upvote_ratio=1.0, created=1668123582.0, d_={'created_utc': 1668123582, 'id': 'yrvd6x', 'selftext': 'Well today just made history in the markets… While my analysis and prediction was VERY wrong for the CPI reading… my play was VERY right and VERY profitable. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18090mk0m7z91.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66e55015abecb1401e1f365f0be41b377516af86\\n\\nA beat on CPI actually makes trading SPY for the next month even harder then a miss. Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI “came down” we have to deal with yet again the “fed pivot/ slowing” news media cycles hitting the tapes. \\n\\nOverall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me0yb2c1m7z91.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8021b8c5066f855c1dea3a9c8e926fdf307d3031\\n\\nSPY just made yet again market history… today was the 3rd largest daily point gain in market history, the 2nd largest intraday points swing, and the largest daily percent change this year (bear or bull). This was the largest green close since march 23rd 2009 which closed up 7.08%. \\n\\nWhat an incredible and unbelievable day. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxzosz19m7z91.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8de2862429b1ff4b94c9a343156e473c42850fff\\n\\nWe impressively broke through the daily rising wedge support last night at market close (now that makes a new support) and today we just touched and held the resistance of that same rising wedge. That is one hell of a swing and I cant even believe it myself. We also went from close in the bear channel to now closing in the purple channel completely skipping the green channel close. \\n\\nIf the market is being rational it is going to come down and at least test 390 purple channel support. There could be a case for it to come all the way down to 384 or even 381.1 to gap fill. However, with the extreme volume on VOLD today and just the overall momentum I wouldn’t be surprised (despite it being illogical) to see tomorrow be yet another big green day. \\n\\nSupport- 393 -&gt; 390 -&gt; 388 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 381.1\\n\\nResistance- 397.9 -&gt; 402 (daily 200ema) \\n\\nSomething I would like to point out is that this day is very similar to May 4th on SPY. That was a FOMC day that went on a similar insane rip EOD and end up with a flat top daily candle much like SPYS today. That day resulted in a massive drop the next day. Something interesting about this also is that the VIX put its biggest drop of the year in since May 4th today also. Tomorrow will be interesting to say the least. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fb9ifoi8m7z91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d502e676d7200589c8b8d7eaa114224495932f88\\n\\nWeekly chart wise you can see we are still in this bull channel withing the green 2022 bear channel.

Something interesting about this also is that the VIX put its biggest drop of the year in since May 4th today also.

The biggest drop as I said since May 4th. While the VIX was in much different levels back then something that is VERY intriguing to me is that today we dropped to about 22.84 and recoiled and the VIX closed right at that key 23.5 support level. I am a little surprised to see that on a 5.5% green day for SPY. Actually I am surprised that the VIX didn’t drop more like 15% especially when you consider that on big red days for CPI or other events we can see a 12-20% green day on the VIX. \\n\\nThis 23.5 level is a big level. The VIX could be hinting to us that the markets are not as bullish as this rally today wants us to believe. I will be watching for a double bottom pop on the VIX tomorrow. \\n\\n**Where am I at right now? Bearish or bullish ?**\\n\\nTo be honest we couldn’t have had a worse outcome today. A beat on CPI just leads to even more speculation from the markets that the Fed is going to pivot/ slow rate hikes next meeting. However, the thing is that MoM inflation did not come down and while yes these were “beats” under expectation and under previous its hard to say after one good reading that we beat inflation. With SPY now being over the 75% retracement line of the bear channel the risk to reward to run calls up here is very low. However, this rally could last too long and we may never see an actual drop to pay out on puts now. I don’t forsee until next CPI/ FOMC any thing big enough to actually put the markets in sell off mode. While I do think we pullback a little just to naturally fill some of this wildness I don’t think itll be too sustained. But playing calls up here just seems like playing with fire too. We are definitely in a short term play area right now.\\n\\nHowever, lets keep this in mind… \\n\\nCPI YoY- 7.7% puts us at the lowest reading since February which was 7.5%.  \\n CPI MoM- 0.4% was under forecast but was the same as previous… that means inflation is still increasing… don’t get this confused… we did not DECREASE inflation… it just didn’t go up as much…  \\n CORE YoY- 6.3% is a decrease but only puts us back at September CORE of 6.3%. that means we saw core go up for one month and then come back down to the previous months numbers.   \\n CORE MoM- 0.3% means after two back to back months of 0.6% MoM CORE we did finally decrease….   \\n \\n\\nNow here is something that I already have on my radar and will be doing a lot of data diving into to figure out the best play for next CPI/ FOMC which is back to back (thinking we can really nail a banger). \\n\\nLets chat really quickly to put it on our radars about the August drop in CPI and the august rally (mind you this is the ONLY other “beat” on cpi all year). \\n\\nIn August CPI YoY beat at 8.5% coming down 0.2% form forecast and an impressive 0.6% from previous. The interesting thing about this prediction was that the forecast was so far below the previous with the 0.2% variance it woulda been incredible if we missed. Interestingly enough the following reading for September came in 0.2% over forecast of 8.1% but WAS a beat and decrease. Looking at the numbers for CPI YoY we have now had 5 readings in a row of CPI YoY decreasing… \\n\\nCPI MoM in august was forecasted at 0.2% and came in at 0%. This is the closest we have been to a decrease in inflation all year but we have still NOT gotten an actual negative reading for MoM. After the August 0% reading we had 0.1% -&gt; 0.4% and now we have 0.4% again. So despite a BEAT of forecast CPI MoM has actually not seen a decrease to match CPI YoY. \\n\\nSince August CORE YoY of 5.9% which actually wasn’t even a beat from previous it was unchanged we had a 6.3% and now a 6.6% reading on YoY core. This reading was 0.2% beat from forecast and a 0.3% beat from previous. From the April CORE 6.5% reading until August we did see a decrease/ unchanged on core YoY. I will be closely watching to see if CORE YoY can unwind again or if we are going to go up. \\n\\nCore MoM was 0.3% in august which was a pretty impressive beat from the previous 0.7%. Much like CPI Mom we have not had a negative reading yet and we have not by any means tamed inflation but there has been slowing of CORE MoM unlike CPI MoM.\\n\\nI am seeing a pretty big potential where we COULD get another good reading on inflation in December actually. Again everything comes down to the forecast. As long as the forecast comes in 0.2% below current actual readings so that would be forecast of CPI 7.5, CPI MoM 0.2, CORE 6.1 and CORE MoM 0.1% we actually could see another impressive beat and our first back to back green CPI days of the year. \\n\\nNow do I believe in real world that inflation is tamed? Absolutely not… no way… shit is so expensive its not funny and yeah used cars have come down (sucks more then It helps) new cars have not come down to match that used car drop. The biggest thing to watch for CPI on December 13th is 1. Will CPI YoY give its 5th consecutive drop, 2. Will CPI MoM and CORE MoM give their first negative readings (showing an actual decrease not just being unchanged) and 3. Will CORE cpi start the trend of coming down again.\\n\\nThe crazy bull case would be that we get back to back good readings on CPI come December 13th and then on December 14th while we still most likely get a 50bps this COULD give JPOW the fuel he needs to finally say the magical words to the market of “we are ready to slow hikes at the next meeting and see the full effect of our rate hikes.” A hinting at 25bps would be an pretty bullish thing and we could end up seeing December 13th and 14th turn into some impressively green two day rally based on that news. I will keep you guys posted and of course post a full trade plan and analysis/ breakdown for those two days.\\n\\nDaily log- \\n\\nToday for me was an amazing day and for many in the server who played the strangle or amazingly played calls only the payout was phenomenal. After the morning win I did open one lotto put pretty early when things started to look heavy and that we wouldn’t take out 390 today, however, that quickly got wrecked. It was worth the risk to reward as I wouldn’t have in my wildest dreams expected a 5.5% green day on spy today. I am shocked we broke through 390 and that we kept pushing EOD even higher. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qhnj8g3tl7z91.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ab1bec8c5c01c907119d7055e6f15b631c4583\\n\\nI played a few level to level plays on SPY but I couldn’t bring myself to scalp today. For me when we are at such an extreme and as much as I want to trust it to continue I struggle to believe in my plays which makes me struggle to believe in myself and I end up cutting early or cutting red when I shouldn’t have. Days like today are better left untraded for me. \\n\\nTomorrow is going to be interesting to say the least. I wouldn’t put it past markets to not even look back and just straight push to gap fill 403 tomorrow but I more sensibly expect a 384 to 390 pullback. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulhhtbjtl7z91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9fbd445b45f90c8e7a531bf17d4bfcd5cf1f01\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdm5jk0ul7z91.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7d15676157cebb0d5a65505ee7caf0e7f7edc9', title='11-10-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', upvote_ratio=1.0, created=1668123416.0, d_={'created_utc': 1668123416, 'id': 'yrvb6a', 'selftext': 'Well today just made history in the markets… While my analysis and prediction was VERY wrong for the CPI reading… my play was VERY right and VERY profitable. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60ed4bwnl7z91.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfcdf132e7e31e5f2c0cfbe59ebb373458784ac8\\n\\nA beat on CPI actually makes trading SPY for the next month even harder then a miss.

Will CORE cpi start the trend of coming down again.\\n\\nThe crazy bull case would be that we get back to back good readings on CPI come December 13th and then on December 14th while we still most likely get a 50bps this COULD give JPOW the fuel he needs to finally say the magical words to the market of “we are ready to slow hikes at the next meeting and see the full effect of our rate hikes.” A hinting at 25bps would be an pretty bullish thing and we could end up seeing December 13th and 14th turn into some impressively green two day rally based on that news. I will keep you guys posted and of course post a full trade plan and analysis/ breakdown for those two days.\\n\\nDaily log- \\n\\nToday for me was an amazing day and for many in the server who played the strangle or amazingly played calls only the payout was phenomenal. After the morning win I did open one lotto put pretty early when things started to look heavy and that we wouldn’t take out 390 today, however, that quickly got wrecked. It was worth the risk to reward as I wouldn’t have in my wildest dreams expected a 5.5% green day on spy today. I am shocked we broke through 390 and that we kept pushing EOD even higher. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qhnj8g3tl7z91.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ab1bec8c5c01c907119d7055e6f15b631c4583\\n\\nI played a few level to level plays on SPY but I couldn’t bring myself to scalp today. For me when we are at such an extreme and as much as I want to trust it to continue I struggle to believe in my plays which makes me struggle to believe in myself and I end up cutting early or cutting red when I shouldn’t have. Days like today are better left untraded for me. \\n\\nTomorrow is going to be interesting to say the least. I wouldn’t put it past markets to not even look back and just straight push to gap fill 403 tomorrow but I more sensibly expect a 384 to 390 pullback. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulhhtbjtl7z91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9fbd445b45f90c8e7a531bf17d4bfcd5cf1f01\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdm5jk0ul7z91.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7d15676157cebb0d5a65505ee7caf0e7f7edc9', 'title': '11-10-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'created': 1668123416.0}),\n",

Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.\\n\\nThis month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.\\n\\nWith USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts\\n\\n**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\\n\\n**JPow Speech**\\n\\nJPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.\\n\\nA lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.\\n\\nI think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.\\n\\n**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\\n\\n**PCE**\\n\\nNow we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report.

It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. \\n\\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. \\n\\n*”DD”*\\n\\nTesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. \\n\\nSo Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. \\n\\nTesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. \\n\\nPeople love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. \\n\\nCheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. \\n\\nFord has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. \\n\\nVW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. \\n\\nTesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. \\n\\nSo the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. \\n\\nThe economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.\\n\\nChina is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. \\n\\nI haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. \\n\\nTLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.\\n\\nPosition 33.69 shares (ik I’m poor).', title='You’re all a bunch of sheep', upvote_ratio=1.0, created=1668211338.0, d_={'created_utc': 1668211338, 'id': 'ysrao5', 'selftext': '*Short term noise*\\n\\nA stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. \\n\\nThe twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons.

This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.\\n\\n**Option 2:**  \\nSpeculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody’s chart  below.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d\\n\\nSo  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)\\n\\nSo that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed’s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  ‘’influncers’’ would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.\\n\\nThe  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  \\nRemember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much.

Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.\\n\\nThe challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.\\n\\nRight now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.\\n\\nI am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.\\n\\n# 2/ The Background and the Backers\\n\\nNotwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.\\n\\nASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.\\n\\nAll sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.\\n\\nRight now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.\\n\\n[ The BlueWalker 3 satellite and ASTS team.

A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\\\\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[ Twitter of Abel Avellan, the ASTS CEO ](https://preview.redd.it/n73nrqddfsx91.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1809c7766728dcfb05dd2ea34ec8ebf82ba06ad5)\\n\\nOther direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**.

To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.\\n\\nThe market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:\\n\\n[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/fzv1jlvqfsx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b98ef716b7a1f45f3c4b3174edd0d32e9397b3)\\n\\nInterestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.\\n\\nASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.\\n\\n[TradingView of ASTS, 1W time frame](https://preview.redd.it/ojmxwldsfsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9626a7e5b476232e8f6fb981ed415e6c1c7669d5)\\n\\nASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.\\n\\nPretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.\\n\\nNow we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.\\n\\n# 4/ The Dangers of a Short Trade and Previous Catalysts\\n\\nThe no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that short sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, short sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.\\n\\nThis year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.\\n\\n1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious short covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a short seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” short trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.\\n2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of short sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.\\n\\nAfter Kerrisdale released their short report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.\\n\\nI think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from short sellers relenting as company executes.\\n\\n# 5/ The New Trade and Upcoming Catalysts\\n\\nWe have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.\\n\\n1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.\\n\\n[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/tt4grepufsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f2bbdd0d7020c98808f9565e0d3db194e3952c)\\n\\n[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ak8ijvhwfsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5016deb82df34c51e1d9b4d59f9b2ca2bc622c55)\\n\\n2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.\\n\\n3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.\\n\\n[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/dscqmdf0gsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7574cf567c54e293b1ad2b49dfd5a07796b3af71)\\n\\nOne of the arguments of short sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.\\n\\n[Note on warrant funding](https://preview.redd.it/ezj8i9n2gsx91.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6636812be27cf933dab429f7d34ae9097caac87)\\n\\nThe reason why I think the moves up are going to be violent is because of high interest from short sellers, including Kerrisdale. A lot of them will have to get out of the way on positive catalysts.

I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.\\n\\n[ASTS, 1D timeframe on TV.

This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero. If you think this is a P&amp;D feel free to short and add fuel to the fire. Good luck.\\n\\nTLDR:\\n\\nThe no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.\\n\\nPositions: 8,000 shares at $6.27\\n\\nI prefer a larger share position than options as it is easier to manage risk.

Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.\\n\\nThe challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.\\n\\nRight now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.\\n\\nI am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.\\n\\n# 2/ The Background and the Backers\\n\\nNotwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.\\n\\nASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.\\n\\nAll sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.\\n\\nRight now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.\\n\\n[ The BlueWalker 3 satellite and ASTS team.

Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nThis week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.\\n\\nThe following is basically my plan for next week.\\n\\n# Major Economic Events\\n\\n**Monday 10/31**\\n\\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI\\n\\n10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct\\n\\n**Tuesday 11/01**\\n\\n9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct\\n\\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct\\n\\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep\\n\\n**Wednesday 11/02**\\n\\n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct\\n\\n2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision\\n\\n2:30 PM Fed Press Conference\\n\\n**Thursday 11/03**\\n\\n8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep\\n\\n10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct\\n\\n**Friday 11/04**\\n\\n8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct\\n\\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct\\n\\nSo all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.\\n\\nSo my play here is in 2 parts.\\n\\nPart 1 - The Rate Hike\\n\\nBelieve it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77\\n\\nAs of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing\\n\\n0% chance of 100Bps\\n\\n81.3% chance of 75Bps\\n\\n18.7% chance of 50Bps\\n\\nNow in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.\\n\\nIn all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.\\n\\nPart 2 - The Meeting\\n\\nWell this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.\\n\\nIf they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.\\n\\nThis part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.\\n\\nAnyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.\\n\\nThe fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)\\n\\nOn the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.\\n\\nAs you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.\\n\\nGuys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently.

While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain. \\n\\nAs you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market. \\n\\nGuys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience.

Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nThis week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes. \\n\\nThe following is basically my plan for next week.\\n\\n# Major Economic Events\\n\\n**Monday 10/31**\\n\\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI\\n\\n10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct\\n\\n**Tuesday 11/01**\\n\\n9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct\\n\\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct\\n\\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep\\n\\n**Wednesday 11/02**\\n\\n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct\\n\\n2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision\\n\\n2:30 PM Fed Press Conference\\n\\n**Thursday 11/03**\\n\\n8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep\\n\\n10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct\\n\\n**Friday 11/04**\\n\\n8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct\\n\\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct \\n\\nSo all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.\\n\\nSo my play here is in 2 parts. \\n\\nPart 1 - The Rate Hike\\n\\nBelieve it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain. \\n\\nAs of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing \\n\\n0% chance of 100Bps\\n\\n81.3% chance of 75Bps\\n\\n18.7% chance of 50Bps\\n\\nNow in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market. \\n\\nIn all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium. \\n\\nPart 2 - The Meeting\\n\\nWell this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time. \\n\\nIf they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows. \\n\\nThis part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle. \\n\\nAnyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now. \\n\\nThe fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful) \\n\\nOn the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen.
