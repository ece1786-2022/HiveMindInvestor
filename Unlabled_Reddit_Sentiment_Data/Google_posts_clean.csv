In after hours it even drops 20%, taking to the prices it traded in January 2016. According to data from GuruFocus, the company is considered significantly undervalued as can be seen from the graph below. 

In general, growth companies at this time suffer greatly from both a lack of liquidity and the fact that they are priced in relation to future cash flows. 

With bond yields skyrocketing, it's more profitable to pocket the coupon of a bond than invest in a stock that hardly pays dividends. On the macro front, GDP data will be released today: hopefully the umpteenth bad news is that the GDP is worse than expected to avoid further tightening by the FED. 90% of analysts expect a 75 basis point hike in rates at the next meeting

12,1666822917,yeasba,1,"Well today was one wild day that‚Äôs for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a ‚Äúlevel to level‚Äù play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren‚Äôt stopping out too soon (this is why I didn‚Äôt chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key support- 381.6 -&gt; 378.9 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3

Key resistance- 385 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple‚Ä¶. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a little excerpt to kinda help explain it. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bowchjn68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c39316cd1e6b2cdd678135245fa4cb5de0f3b7

You know those little maps that say ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak‚Ä¶ apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover‚Ä¶ its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3770

Key resistance- 3875 -&gt; 3925

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khdd3q1o68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=294783afc532d3880c7fbea998d610a3294c2acc

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn‚Äôt very bullish‚Ä¶ 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing‚Ä¶ technically Tesla beat but missed revenue‚Ä¶ its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before‚Ä¶ But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don‚Äôt know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 145.5

Key resistance- 150.9 -&gt; 152.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today‚Ä¶ So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -&gt; 214.4 -&gt; 209.9 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234

As if the VIX couldn‚Äôt become anymore detached from reality‚Ä¶ we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers‚Ä¶ however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That‚Äôs really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn‚Äôt planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it‚Äôs a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

Wish me luck‚Ä¶. Im hoping im not remind why I don‚Äôt do overnight swings and why I don‚Äôt play earnings at open tomorrow‚Ä¶.

Sellers want to negate that scenario by being responsive at the upper end of the balance areas. The first downside target would be the monthly VPOC 3690 and in case we break and hold below, 3650 and the Weekly Extreme Low 3590 comes into play.

In Europe, on the other hand, another hike in ECB interest rates of 0.75 points (Thursday) is expected, while the Dutch TTF ( european [$NATGAS](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/natgas) ) drops 10%, reaching -70% from its highs. If we have good news it is likely that the technical rebound that started last week can continue but until we have some encouraging inflation data we will continue to be in a bear market. 

The most important thing is to reduce core inflation which is heavily influenced by the housing market. It is usually always the last to surrender.

For a long time, almost all of 2022, I just didn't even want to look at any of this anymore, was so burnt out. But now I've started work full time and I have money I should be looking to invest, and I think it's a good time to do so for my future.  


Currently, I have around 15k I can invest and per month I can squeeze out around 500 to continuously invest.  


I want to have a fresh start, and this time make some more smarter decisions. I've spent some time to compile a list of companies from different sectors I could star to look into which maybe good opportunities:

Now, I'm still young in my early 20s, so I can still tolerate some risk. I want to set aside a few selected choices from the above for long term (10-15 years) but more so look to take more risks with the next 3-5 years in mind.

I'd really appreciate advice you guys would have as to how I should allocate my money, and from the above what should I choose and focus on (and anything else you may think is better, I know I'm totally missing any Energy, don't much about it)

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Another day of big reversals on Wall Street, with stocks posting their best week since June after a treasury rout stalled. The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It‚Äôs important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It‚Äôs do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington‚Äôs most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in [a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653?mod=article_inline)from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC‚Äôs work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN).com Inc., [Meta Platforms](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META) Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, [Alphabet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG) Inc.‚Äôs Google, [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) Corp. and [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) Corp.

I‚Äôve come to the realization that buying $GOOG is the smartest decision an investor can make. I‚Äôve opened a new portfolio, where I will be setting aside 1/3 of my monthly income and buying Google shares, and nothing else.

I don‚Äôt need to tell you how dominate Google is with search, Microsoft tried to take a run at google with Bing a decade ago, they spent 20 Billion, and failed. The MOAT google has on search is astounding. They make 300 million dollars a day off search alone. ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù has become a synonym for ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù

That‚Äôs not even including YouTube, Chrome, Android ect ect. Every kid at my local school district is given a Chromebook.

And if I had to place a bet on which company will dominate AI services in the future, it would be google. I regularly use the Google lens AI to find out what plant/tree/insect/item, literally anything, just take a photo of it and it will tell you what it is. It‚Äôs incredible and extraordinarily useful.

I just took a picture of one of my X-rays, I know what the radiologist assessment is already, but the app doesn‚Äôt. It pulled up images of similar x rays with the same diagnosis. Think of that, the AI is already able to replace jobs in the medical field. Find a similar case, and show the course of action needed. Incredible.

I think this is the stock of the 21st century, this is like buying Tobacco stocks in 1902, you‚Äôll make a fortune, the fallacy is ‚Äúit‚Äôs too late‚Äù no, the train will keep chugging along, you just watch.",Why the smartest play might be just buying Google Stock.,1.0,2022-10-10 03:24:45

What else was introduced in March? A $1.9 trillion stimulus package called the ‚ÄúAmerican Rescue Plan‚Äù. Business‚Äôs got relief and spent money on advertising to try to attract more business, as anyone in that situation would have done. 

With rising rates, a strong dollar which affects international spending, inflation, and companies left and right lowering guidance. I can‚Äôt help but think that $TTD has yet to be hit from some reduced spending. The charts also indicate that $TTD is in a downtrend. 

$TTD also trades at a stupid high P/E compared to the other publicly traded ad business‚Äôs ($CCO, $OMC, $GOOG, $IPG) 

They do have an investor day October 4th, so I expect a little bit of a bounce after that, so good opportunity to add to my current position. 

Would like to hear opinions or reasons why I am thinking incorrectly about this. I have strong conviction and will be adding more.

Google is now trading for a 16x forward earnings and 11x EBITDA. Its not as sensitive to supply chain issues and inflation as other companies are. Google is literally the internet and not going anywhere and is a huge monopoly with no competitors even dreaming of coming close. It is also extremely oversold with an RSI below 30 and at 52 week lows. This is one of those All-In opportunities that you can feel proud of and brag to your dads boyfriend about.

1. Growth Rating- How likely a company is to grow in revenue and/or size in the next 1-2 years
2. Profitability Rating- How likely a company is to be profitable in the next few years
3. Upside Breakout - Higher scores indicate a larger chance of a sharp move upwards in price, any time within the next 1-2 years

&amp;#x200B;

Amc1 call underlying  = price of APE + AMC. These exist because of a dividend via preferred stock. Think of it as if googl and goog had and option the equates to the price of both of them put together. 

Market markers and SHFs suppressing amc with puts out the ass. Specifically $10 9/26 expirations

The reason they are doing this is for 2 obvious reasons. 1) they can manipulate the underlying price of amc1 via suppressing amc with put options. Ape has no option chain so tough to manipulate (cough cough kenny). It‚Äôs also T-0 settlement and extremely illiquid.  They bring amc down and try to maintain ape price as much as possible so that AMC1 remains OTM. Because if AMC1 became in the money market makers would have to hedge both APE and AMC. It would be epic beyond belief. What they don‚Äôt want is for both to go up at the same time. 

Ape is same day settlement as a preferred stock. Brokers still don‚Äôt have them in many countries. It halted 10 times on Monday and 2 times today. If you haven‚Äôt seen or known this then you live under a rock. 

I only have 20 AMC1 calls $40 strikes 3 months out. I will be looking to accumulate AMC $8 strike puts 3 months out minimum and will buy ape shares. Why? Because they cannot contain ape, only with ‚Äútransitory‚Äù halts. They can maintain and supress AMC via puts easy obviously but if I buy amc puts then those fuckers also have to pay me and suppressing amc is their only way out to keep AMC1 OTM.

49,1661219325,wvbse0,1,"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-video-cuts-earnings-and-revenue-outlook-for-the-year-stock-falls-11661199597?mod=mw_latestnews

Zoom Video Communications Inc. is struggling to convince people to pay for its videoconferencing service in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a trimmed forecast and falling stock price Monday.

Zoom ZM, -2.07% executives reduced their earnings and revenue guidance for the fiscal year Monday afternoon, and Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg blamed a stronger U.S. dollar ‚Äî a problem many global tech companies have called out in recent earnings reports ‚Äî but also a decline in ‚Äúthe online business,‚Äù or the more casual Zoom user.

‚ÄúOur revenue was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, performance of the online business, and to a lesser extent sales weighted to the back end of the quarter,‚Äù Steckelberg said in a statement included with the results.

In an interview with MarketWatch and a conference call Monday afternoon, Steckelberg acknowledged that individuals and small businesses have changed their habits. Many aren‚Äôt flocking to the service as often or for as long as they did during the peak of the pandemic, when many Americans were working almost exclusively from home and socializing with friends over the service. An increase in one-on-one meetups, vacations and hybrid work schedules have altered the post-pandemic business cycle for Zoom, executives acknowledge, and getting users to pay is harder.

‚ÄúThe big challenge is new customer additions,‚Äù she said.

Zoom recently installed a 40-minute limit on users with a Basic, or free, subscription, which Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said could be a way to push more users to become paying subscribers. Steckelberg told MarketWatch that the time cap has had a ‚Äúsignificantly positive impact‚Äù so far, but admitted in the conference call it was ‚Äúnot enough to overcome the macro dynamics.‚Äù

The news wasn‚Äôt all bad ‚Äî Zoom‚Äôs enterprise business, which sells subscriptions to larger organizations, grew 27% to $599 million. Enterprise customers improved 18% to 204,100 over the past year through contracts with UCLA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -7.43% and others, as well as longer deals. Zoom Phone licenses hit a record of nearly 4 million, up more than 100% year-over-year.

‚ÄúIt was a mixed quarter, with enterprise proving to be strong,‚Äù Steckelberg told MarketWatch.

The ongoing friction between employees who wish to continue to work from home and employers like Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.30%, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs GOOGL, -2.53% GOOG, -2.58% Google and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META, -2.92% ‚Äî all of whom are sitting on acres of unused commercial real estate and asking workers to come in at least twice a week ‚Äî could have a profound impact on Zoom. A group of Apple employees on Monday launched a petition asking CEO Tim Cook for a more flexible work policy.

The company also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.94%, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -2.03%, Google and many other corners.

M Science‚Äôs software analyst Charles Rogers believes users aren‚Äôt jumping to other platforms, but cutting the service because of inflation and more relaxed pandemic guidelines. He also saw more worrisome results internationally than in the U.S., with a second consecutive quarterly decline in the European region and sequentially flat sales in the Asia Pacific quadrant.

Zoom posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $45.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, up from $1.02 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Zoom reported earnings of $1.05 a share, down from $1.36 a share last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 94 cents a share on revenue of $1.12 billion.

Zoom executives said they now expect full-year adjusted earnings of $3.66 to $3.69 a share on revenue of roughly $4.39 billion, down from $3.70 to $3.77 a share on sales of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion. For the third quarter, they expect 82 to 83 cents a share on revenue of about $1.1 billion, while analysts on average had been projecting 92 cents a share on sales of $1.15 billion, according to FactSet.

Zoom shares declined nearly 9% in after-hours trading following release of the results, after closing with a 2.1% decline at $97.44. Zoom‚Äôs stock is down 47% so far in 2022. The broader S&amp;P 500 index  SPX, -2.14%  has slid 13% this year.","Zoom is struggling to convince consumers to pay, and the stock is sliding",1.0,2022-08-23 01:48:45

I know why you're bullish. Bears are repeating what they've heard from their favorite Tiktok analyst about QE, how our economy can't handle 3%+, etc. When the shoe shine boy says the doom is here, inverse that fucker. But look, I looked. I looked at Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and your mom. I've got mom fetishes like I got 10-Q fetishes, and the generals--the kings of the Nasdaq? They're getting old. They had their best years. What do you think covid represented? The peak of technology. You think it gets better from here? AWS gonna keep breaking records? Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me ""the chicken comes home to roost."" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a fa√ßade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Enough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, ""but that's another topic"" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**

&amp;#x200B;

**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost. All the liquidity be sucked up, fed fund at 125 bps higher than today, and maturities of bonds without reinvestment**

&amp;#x200B;

 **You'll see, and it'll probably be after you do anything about it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Wish you all the best, but only a few end up with the bread in the end.**

The usual websites to show this data that are free are Yahoo Finance and Finviz.

Well, both commit the same mistake:

* [Forward P/E of $GOOG on Finviz: 16.30](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG)
* [Forward P/E OF $GOOGL on Finviz: 16.41](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOGL)

* [Forward P/E of $GOOGL on Finviz: 18.90](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/key-statistics?p=GOOGL)

Guess what? The number is twice that amount! Because this websites are taking the earnings of Google as a whole but then they are splitting that earnings between half of the shares (half for $GOOG and half for $GOOGL as if those were independent companies!)

If that is not a pro-trick that deserves twice the valuation I don't know what it is. Hats off to Google!

The right number can be calculated from [their last earnings report](https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q2_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf):

* Outstanding shares (Class A,B,C) =&gt; 64,402 Millions
* Total income on 2022-Q2 =&gt; 69,685 Millions
* Forward P/E at $110 the share = (64,402 \* 110) / (69,685 \* 4) =&gt; **25.41**

How many times do we have to witness OPEN CRIME?

For the last 2 years I have been communicating with Mr. John Leroy Henessy, founder and CEO of Google, through his cryptic tweets. After using advanced means of gathering data I realized all his tweets were exactly at 20:01.

Couldnt just be a coincidence.

I spent weeks analyzing his tweets as soon as they were posted, and came to the conclusion that this man was fighting against the big money and giving the little guy a chance of making generational money.

And there was the announcement. A split through dividend. A‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsplitvidend‚Äù, if you will. You guys don‚Äôt understand how genius this move was. 

Some of you may argue that this is a simple move to lower the price per share while literally changing nothing. You are dumbasses. See, let me repeat it again, it isnt a simple split. It is a SPLIT THROUGH MEANS OF A DIVIDEND.

Yeah, you read that right. We would receive 20 times our sharecount. My portfolio would literally 20x through the night. Nothing like these shitty 4x at the dying JPEG retailer. No, we are talking 20x, baby. Genius, absolutely genius.

But then, today I opened my ComputerShare app, tits absolutely jacked, ready to be a millionaire. I had received the 20x shares‚Ä¶ **BUT THE PRICE FELL FOR THE SAME AMOUNT!**


At first I thought it was an error from ComputerShare (honestly, their site is kinda shitty). But then I googled the price and analysing the price I realized‚Ä¶ they did it again‚Ä¶ SHORT LADDER ATTACKS CELLARBOXING. And, as it *‚ÄùCONVENIENTLY‚Äù* was the weeknd, THEY had an excuse to remove the buy button.

THEY cant keep getting away with this. I WILL be emailing the stock market manager and ask you do the same.

In the mean time, I keep buying, hodling and DRSing. The longer THEY keep doing it, the higher they floor.

With the assistance of ARMER back in May we got bored and decided to map out what the 2022 market crash COULD look like IF we followed the 2008 crash... and yes before everyone says it... i know this crash is different.. every crash is different... but all we have is historical data to go off of and trajectory wise we are the closest to 2008 then any others in my opinion...   


Anyways lets go down hypothetical lane... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/96ufqz2088c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801eb182455a55f55aeb2478d085466e516f26b6

Here is the WEEKLY SPY 2022 chart (i deleted all my drawings for easier viewing of candles) 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6kjonxc88c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38a32b7efb371e91fb22f25e3bc990305ce3a39

And here is the 2008 weekly chart... (i adjusted zoom slightly)   
Looking at these charts... it could be inferred that we are at the last rising hump in August/ September before the massive dropped started...   


Okay lets look at some numbers...   


2022 crash prediction based on 2008 percent's- 385 --&gt; 431 (11.9% rise) --&gt; 367 (15% drop) --&gt; 392 (7% rise) --&gt; 255 (53% drop) --&gt; 301 --&gt; 229 --&gt; 301 --&gt; 217

Actual- 381 --&gt; 417 (9.5% actual rise) --&gt; 362 (13% actual drop) --&gt; 393 (8% rise) --&gt; expected 53% drop= $189

we hit 393 on June 28th. We should be right around the top again then based off these numbers... 

&amp;#x200B;

Now according to the 2008 crash... we actually are at max level before ""the big one"" IF we actually follow the 2008 crash model... we should be at our last bear market rally and should see the capitulation any time now.... 

now adjusting for the overall difference in % expected vs actual we would see something closer to 40-45% drop from 393 which puts us at around... 216-235. 

&amp;#x200B;

using previous lows from previous crashes/ corrections... the blue dotted line utilizes the 2008 crashes low and the 2020 covid crashes low to give us a predicted bottom of 255 to 280 if we were to continue the current bear market trajectory... of course a true capitulation would accelerate this and we could see that number... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3g35f12y88c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2992158cbbf1a47b39ff11c7ff12b706de37fc11

red dotted line uses the 2008 crashes low and the february 2016 bottom to give us a trajectory of 295 to 315 on current trajectory.

lastly we have the orange dotted line which utulizes the two lowest points POST covid crash (Sept 2020 and October 2020) to give us a trajectory of 360 to 370 as bottom...

https://preview.redd.it/7k2vj07198c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4e6c4f634784dc8b329e6afcdc7209d567783dc

now the crazy thing about this 360 to 380 and using this covid 2020 recovery trend is that we already saw a bounce off that orange dotted line ( a near perfect bounce) June 2022 AND the weekly 200ema is now perfectly on top of this orange dotted line... 

&amp;#x200B;

what if we did know the bottom or at least knew how to predict it? 

&amp;#x200B;

it seems if we blast through 365 again we could see that 295-315

red dotted line uses the 2008 crashes low and the february 2016 bottom to give us a trajectory of 295 to 315 on current trajectory.

lastly we have the orange dotted line which utulizes the two lowest points POST covid crash (Sept 2020 and October 2020) to give us a trajectory of 360 to 370 as bottom...

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest issue with this all is the scaling of it... the 2008 crash was much slower. 2022 took 6 months to crash 25% while 2008 took 9 months to crash 25% initially. that means this crash is happening about  50% faster than 2008... so we need to bear that in mind. For reference the 2020 crash one month to crash 25% or about 9 times faster....   


so bearing that in mind when comparing charts and time frames... there is still a case to be had that the crash IS coming... the question is when and will we actually know? 

&amp;#x200B;

so what if we did know the bottom or at least knew how to predict it? 

&amp;#x200B;

it seems if we blast through 365 again we could see that 295-315  


  
In my opinion after i had 1000% expected to see a crash/ capitulation start Wednesday when that dogwater CPI came in... my best worst case scenario comes next week.   


Tesla reports wednesday night after bell... in my opinion not a big factor. It may hit or miss... i dont think markets care enough and it in and of itself can not take the markets down.

This right here is the ONLY perfect shit storm i can even remotely suspect to take the markets to the bottom... IF MSFT, GOOG, amazon all miss AND FOMC ""surprises"" (lol) us with a 100bps hike AND then GDP comes in thursday morning negative 1000% confirming we are in a recession and then APPLE tanks after bell thursday... The week of July 25th could be one of the biggest drops we have seen yet....

so how should we play this? Despite what the numbers are calling for... i am looking for SPY this week to break out to that 400 to 415 level... on the weekly chart 415 perfectly rejects the black channels resistance line AND perfectly rejects the sideways purple channel... 

IF we get the big bull run this week AND end up somewhere near 410-415 by EOW.... AND the vix unwinds down near 18-20... i think friday before market close is our chance to load up on 30-60DTE VIX calls and SPY puts...   


and then IF by some miracle the markets still rally after the week of July 25th...  then i believe the bottom IS in... i think that orange dotted line i showed you above IS the bottom....

I saw a really interesting chart today that shows the UMICH consumer sentiment vs the Russel 1000 that shows they are severely diverted from eachother. 

What does this mean? Well this is the furtherest they have ever been from eachother in the last 30 years. There is still a lot of people out there that thinks despite how far the market has come down that there is still a very long way to go. I would have thought CPI woulda started the next leg down but that is not the case‚Ä¶ lets get into that a little bit.

Yesterday the fed went from ‚Äúwe will not be doing a 100bps hike‚Äù to wow yeah man we really just might do a 100bps hike back today where now its down to a 17% chance of 100bps hike. The craziest thing about this all is if you look at the last CPI it jumped from 8.3% to 8.6% from April to May and JPOW shit himself and the markets did too with a massive 75bps hike that was not expected‚Ä¶ now CPI is up 0.5% HIGHER than previous CPI (more than last time which was only 0.3%) and all of a sudden it doesn‚Äôt matter what we do rate hike wise and markets don‚Äôt care about 75 vs. 100bps hike? 

Confused? Me too‚Ä¶ I touch on this a little below as to what I suspect is the true thing going on. 

https://preview.redd.it/t339fnversb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79712e9d1e204460a4cb516d7c50ff700396a6fa

I mentioned on the CPI night that I think we are experiencing some psyops in the market‚Ä¶ the media is fueling this rollercoaster and we are being led astray for now. It is even more evident by the VIX that the ‚Äúfear‚Äù is being contained right now‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/86mdud1grsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6863b2f55ecccf654fd87d8426b4d53b6f5ff82e

The VIX daily chart is very telling of current sentiment and that is that nothings going to take us down. After spy had 4 days of red this week and closed out today green for this week SPY is only down $0.72 cents on the week. They were close to closing this week out as a green week. 

This is the lowest close on the VIX since June 8th. Interestingly enough June 8th was the top of the last trend before we crashed. Looking at the vix there is a case that we could see a bounce Monday around 23.9 on the VIX at that support level which would let SPY truly top before we start our next leg down. 

I am also now if we break through that 23.9 level under the impression that the markets are going to completely unwind the VIX down to 18-20 level before tesla earnings hit on Wednesday night. Tesla will be the first notable earnings that could move the markets and then the week after that is massive with MSFT, GOOG, APPLE, and META. Not only that but we also have FOMC on Wednesday the 27th and then GDP is on July 28th the next day. That GDP should confirm a recession. 

Many of you red my UVXY/ VIX calls post and I do believe I was correct. The one thing I am wondering is if I was wrong on the timing. I suspect markets to panic from CPI to FOMC like previously but I am wondering if markets are going to rally from CPI to FOMC and then once that week of earnings and FOMC and GDP happen markets then panic till the next CPI and FOMC. At this point I think watching for the VIX to hit 18-20 and UVXY to hit 11.5 again to go long on some 30-60dte calls is the way to go. This is the lowest close for UVXY since April 21st interestingly enough. UVXY also has not closed under 11.5 since January. So that will be a key level to watch for next week.

The one thing im really watching on the daily is the close of this candle. It is a hanging man LIKE candle but the wick is not long enough. So this could end up like a continuation candle similar to June 23rd instead of a reversal candle like May 17th. 

https://preview.redd.it/om58fu6hrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee04dd25917171850484aaea0cbd89b3863abb7a

Things to note here for a bull vs. bear case on daily and weekly chart. 

Bull case- despite a bearish catalyst week we managed to close it with a dragonfly doji. Despite all the craziness we saw this week we saw a bullish finish to the week. We got our weekly 372 channel support test/ bounce. On the daily we broke through the red dotted resistance line which means we made a high high. We also close above the daily 8ema AND the daily 20ema for the first time since last Friday.  

Bear case- on the weekly we saw a new lower low for the third week in a row and that was also followed by the third lower high too. While we did not confirm resistance there is a VERY large descending wedge forming on the weekly chart. We have enough of the triangle left that there is a case we see a rejection next week followed by a descent below. Despite the bullish close today one could assume the last three days of bullish volume came from OPEX and how much downward OI there was. We now have a daily gap of $1.54 on the daily (note- this gap is actually closer to $2 as the daily movement of SPY never actually hit $379.05 on Thursday despite what the candles say). While historically gaps always fill we still have a 402 gap above unfilled so that is not something you can say anymore. 

Daily supports to watch- 382 √† 379 (gap fill) √† 375 √† 370 (channel support) 

Weekly supports to watch- 372 (channel support) √† 364 (weekly 200ema)

Daily resistance to watch- 388 √† 390 (downward channel support AND sideways channel support) √† 393 √† 398 √† 402 (gap fill)

Weekly resistance to watch- 388 (ascending wedge resistance) √† 413 (downward channel resistance)

What I am watching for is whether we are going to attempt to back fill this gap Monday or Tuesday or whether we are going to break through 390. 390 is a HUGE level for Monday. IF that level is broken then we are actually hella bullish. With no major earnings to really effect the market and no real economic data to effect it either till Thursday at open we just might see a hell of a ripper early next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/5zggc0vhrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9804cfbd004521003749725d4227a650c72d2392

ES daily actually looks a little different than SPYs. I mentioned yesterday that it looked like futures was turning bullish and it appears Thursday might be the temp bottom again. We did see a rejection of that blue dotted support line at 3867 EOD today though but it closed over the daily 8 AND 20 ema for the first time since July 8th (which ironically was top). 

I am watching on the daily for Mondays open if we see a red open and we hold resistance at 3850 we will most likely be headed for a back test of that key 3744 support. Sundays night open will be very very important to watch. Anything over 3850 Sunday is bullish for the week. 

Daily supports to watch- 3793 √† 3744 √† 3672 (channel support) 

Daily resistance to watch- 3850 √† 3915 (channel support) √† 4020

https://preview.redd.it/305c46dirsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=946d2343961418ae9a82028e7630a4d59e9e8239

Futures weekly chart is probably the most bearish of anything I have talked about yet. So it will be curious to see which one plays out. 

The weekly chart actually confirmed the resistance of the descending triangle on Monday and closed with a true hanging man candle. This true hanging man candle has me suspect that we are going to see a retrace come Monday that takes us back down to that 3675 area. The futures charts are more skeptical and bearish then SPY itself. 

If we were to have a mega bull week next week we could see not only the descending wedge broken (any open over 3875 breaks it) we could see the overall downward channel and the overall sideways channel broken. It would take an impressive 7.7% move to do it but with the way the markets are running its not impossible. Or we could see a retest of that channel and rejection which could confirm further downside in two weeks for FOMC/ earnings/ GDP.

Weekly supports- 3830 √† 3675

Weekly resistance- 3875 √† 4136 √† 4165

Overall SPY/ ES I would say I am bullish next week and will be looking to position to be bearish the following week. 

https://preview.redd.it/dwvgt6xirsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2140f0ae9ed8cec493e005e038ff089b4b17dbcf

AMD actually had a hell of a great day and week this week. AMD looks to on the daily have established a V shaped recovery at 71.6. My pre-market plan was to go long on AMD after it back tested 79.5 support and then go long with 7dte calls for next week looking for 87 range. I should have done it but I decided to wait. I am hesitant only that the markets are a little irrational right now. Most likely will regret that next week. 

Daily supports- 79.5 √† 76.6 √† 71.6

Daily resistance- 83.8 √† 87

https://preview.redd.it/t7em8pjjrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a546f501675e7732e435ba25a37d583fd9868007

AMD weekly is in a nice descending wedge too. The weekly candle is a hanging man so that worries me but it should be able to push through if it keeps up the same momentum. Overall we are looking for 87 resistance to be tested next week and to hold that v shaped support line. If we break through 87‚Ä¶ 95-98 is on the table for sure. But any retracement below 77 would be noted as bearish omen. 

10% challenge-

I had a great but boring day today. I did not like the open today as we dumped then ripped and had some wild candles. With the massively green open and UMICH sentiment I knew I was not going to go in until closer to 1030-11. By them we were already at the probable high of day IV wise and I was not going to play anything above that. My strategy is very strict about not going long/ short when SPY hits those levels. I also noticed that IV on SPY and AMD were hella high today and my mid day we got crushed. I watched 384.6 resistance hold all day long and EOD played a nice SPX (my first one) 0dte put scalp off the breakdown and then played a SPY 0dte call once biden was done talking and the volume came pumping in. Overall GREAT day and GREAT week. 

This is actually the highest weekly WIN RATE year to date for me. This week I was EXTRA patient and really waited for my plays and waited for the chart to come to me. It made all the difference.

I look forward to a good weekend to rest. I am sitting cash gang over the weekend. I was tempted to go long on SPY calls but decided to stick to what it old myself at the beginning of the month and do no swings. The biggest loss this week came from CPI day. It came from ANTICIPATING a play AND it came from trading while SPY was at the probable IV range. I did not stick to my guns that day and I did not let the chart come to me. I also double down on that loser which became 2x as big of a loser. Doubling down can work when tactfully done‚Ä¶ but most of the time like I have said before don‚Äôt add to a loser to make it a bigger loser‚Ä¶ I also took a loss on Monday due to TOS not filling my order completely which is a logistical issue I could not avoid and is part of the risk of 0dtes in the last 15minutes. 

Overall great week for me mentally and trading wise. Look forward to the weekend with the fam and seeing you guys back on Monday!","7-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX/ UVXY and AMD weekly TA",1.0,2022-07-15 21:07:15

For everyone else, here's what I'm seeing in the charts, if you're into that sorta thing.

**SPY:**

https://preview.redd.it/xp44b7g01ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44f2b518fbe0f3da341b79eebe6a61892e2f6a49

Still have some work to do if we're going to fill that $400 gap.  Rejecting $390 this week may have some of you concerned but checkout the Weekly chart

This weekly chart just further outlines the trend reversal that the daily divergences have been showing leading into this rally.

&amp;#x200B;

**QQQ:**

https://preview.redd.it/7xigs6v63ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b21aa5cff8d8d35acb8c7c6c382e2146a93c5dee

Going to use QQQ this week because some of you are so smooth-brained that you didn't know there were any other NASDAQ ETF's and were so proud of yourselves trying to call me out about it.

Anyway, looks like we've officially broken out of this falling wedge thanks to the big guys waking up (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT), the others are close behind.  I'd be looking for the $300 gap to fill leading into CPI, then a pullback because it's fucked, possibly down to around $285 support, maybe lower.  Ideally I'd be looking for re-entry / entry / adding to longs at a completed back-test of the trendline we just broke this week.  Regardless of what the Fed does this month, this rally has some legs and will continue for a while, or so the technicals are indicating...

For context of the reversal manifesting in the Weekly charts, QQQ's look just like SPY

Here's a quick look at the put/call ratio, focus on the blue line (9-day MA).  Notice how June 14th we put in a lower high which coincides with the higher low in the indices this week, then crossing down below the 0.95 line breaking trend and confirming that people are becoming more bullish on the market.

&amp;#x200B;

**10Y**

https://preview.redd.it/s10fttq16ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d685f1cc31199945aca3240ca54df8d0acc62b

Still inside this rising wedge pattern on bearish divergence in the PPO and somewhat in the RSI.  Will still need to wait it out but it looks like a reversal is coming in both the 10 and 2 year, keeping in mind, we're STILL inverted since like Thursday of last week.

Let's talk BANKS since we're coming up on earnings next week!

**BAC:  Earnings 7/18**

https://preview.redd.it/58ma3p1f8ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc928df6038897136505e52b56ce61ed524752a4

Bank of America has been in this falling wedge for a while and has recently started to show some bullish divergence in the RSI, not so much in the PPO though.  I think we have a pretty solid floor under us at around $31 which was resistance back in 2019.  We have a gap just above some potential resistance around $34 which I think we hit easily, will deal with the gap when we get there.

**JPM:  Earnings 7/14**

https://preview.redd.it/lsz06oej9ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab06934305b15c42978ca614eaf8f5808cfddb7

JP Morgan Chase!  
JP Morgan Chase!  
JP Morgan Chase!  
JPM has also been inside this falling wedge for a while with a bit better defined bullish divergence.  Again a solid floor under us with a nice rejection off of a previous gap left open since Nov. 2020.  Overhead resistance at $117.50-ish I think will be pushed through pretty easily and likely won't see much push back from the bears until the $125 gap.

**GS:  Earnings 7/18**

https://preview.redd.it/r68xe8pnaha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0192b4927c8aa6793a16e89c8c6d94c5b29dd6

I think I'm less confident in this one.  The falling broadening wedge is bullish but I'm not seeing as solid footing as the others at this point, we're kind of in the middle of support/resistance right now and the divergences in the RSI and PPO aren't really as convincing as JPM.

**VIX**

https://preview.redd.it/85h8p64abha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5767b1fb31bcea6b4c71c31b66f28aa58f36e553

Yah, so what, i do TA on the VIX, wanna fight about it?

Showing the 1-hr chart on this one to keep everyone on their toes.  Today we fell out the bottom of this falling wedge with bullish divergence still intact on the RSI, BUT burned through on the PPO, hopefully that trend continues into the PPO.  Lately the money glitch has been buy puts at VIX $25, buy calls at VIX $35 and I'm here to tell you that didn't work today.

Keep an eye on this bastard though, if it claws its way back into this wedge then look for a big fat stinky dump shortly there after.

**Conclusion:**

I think Bond investors are flooding into equities right now so we're likely going to see continuation of this rally much to the perma-bear's chagrin.  I wouldn't get too comfortable though if you're long because at any moment they could decide to flood back into bonds as a safe haven, it really depends on that the Fed does at the July FOMC, till then however, I'll be buying the dip.

So you can see, the account had basically nothing it in, about $300. Lucky for me, my wife's boyfriend gave me my allowance for the year all up front so I stuck the $32k in this account. I made a little money at the end of May, made my IRA contribution a week later, and then have made about $11k in the last two weeks.

I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold.

Do you see any potential in the recent Amazon split and upcoming Google 20:1? Are these Blue Chips, stocks that our dads wished they invested in before the price was to high for the average investor, going to be more attractive now that they are ""affordable"". I know that splits are have no intrinsic value, it doesn't mean that they are actually ""cheaper"" but it does have a phycological affect on average traders who don't have millions to invest. I'm more inclined to purchase Amazon and Google at $100+ and own ""more"" whole shares, than spend limited capital on a few or have fractional share (I'm with TD, so I don't have the ability to purchase fractional shares yet.)

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my strategy was to purchase Amazon option calls before the split, that expire next Friday (Jun 10), with expectations that the price will go up next week. I also purchased Google calls well in advance anticipating the price will go up in the weeks prior to the split. These calls expire the day of the split and some in August.  What are some of you all doing, if anything?

107,1669729455,z7uh2r,1," Twitter owner Elon Musk claimed on Monday in a series of tweets that Apple had threatened to remove the Twitter app from the App Store as part of its app review moderation process.

‚ÄúApple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won‚Äôt tell us why,‚Äù Musk tweeted.

In other tweets fired off on Monday morning, he called Apple‚Äôs App Store fees a ‚Äúsecret 30% tax,‚Äù and ran a poll asking if ‚ÄúApple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers.‚Äù He also claimed that Apple has pulled most of its advertising from Twitter.

Apple‚Äôs App Store is the only way to distribute software to iPhones. If the Twitter app were pulled, the social network would lose one of its main distribution platforms, although the service is available for the web.

In addition, Apple requires iPhone app makers to pay between 15% and 30% of any digital goods sold through their apps. Musk has said one of his plans for Twitter is to raise billions of dollars from subscriptions, such as Twitter Blue, which is offered through the iPhone app. If it were to grow to Musk‚Äôs goals, Apple would collect hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.

Apple has faced challenges to its App Store fees and policies from companies such as Spotify and Epic Games, but Musk is no stranger to attracting worldwide attention, and may represent Apple‚Äôs biggest challenge to its control over iPhone app distribution so far.

Apple declined to comment about Musk‚Äôs tweets.

But there are signs that Apple is watching the social network closely to see if it violates any App Store policies.

Representatives for unnamed app stores, which include Apple‚Äôs App Store as well as Google Play for Android devices, reached out to Twitter earlier this month after Musk took over and the site saw a wave of hate speech, according to a New York Times op-ed by Yoel Roth, Twitter‚Äôs former head of trust and safety.

Phil Schiller, Apple‚Äôs former chief marketer who oversees App Review, apparently deleted his Twitter account earlier this month after Musk took over.

Knowbe4, Proofpoint, and many others have been purchased recently showing interest in the field for acquisitions. My Favorite and my heaviest bag is CYREN tell me what you think.

Cyren has been falling like a knife with no support for the past 2 years. Improvements in their business as well as new products and revenue streams are ready to change the direction of this company.  They really just started selling ""products"" in 2019 and focused heavily on R and D and product development. With this said they have existing relationships with Microsoft, Google, Zscaler, etc...

Significant changes in the ecosystem of Cyber Regulations

(These changes will keep this sector in demand and growing)

¬∑ New Cyber regulations for Health Care Industry and Critical Infrastructure at large

¬∑ Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (companies must ensure that they are properly investing in cyber security)

¬∑ Legacy IT Reduction Act of 2022 (aims to make agencies diagnose issues with legacy tech and update critical systems accordingly)

¬∑ Daily OBV (per Webull data which is different than trading views data) 

o Prior to February 2022 had oscillated around -2 million and +4 million at the height of its trading and this was while the stock had over 40 million shares outstanding.

o Since Feb 2022 we have been on a straight rise taking breaks before rising again from a low point of -580,000 to where we stand now at +201 million with a outstanding share size of only 8 million shares. That is an OBV of 25x the outstanding float size, this is not normal with stocks which you will see if you do some overlay research on other charts.

It is my firm belief that this company is on the rise and if market makers and shorts in general continue to crush its value smart investors will be taking full advantage.

I work at a small investment management company and have been using this trading journal created by one of my IT co-workers in light and dark themes.

It lets me record and analyze the trades I take, and also helps me improve a trading strategy, comparing the trades by the criteria they meet and seeing what works best for me.

The template comes with instructions in pdf files that explain in detail how it works and you can find the answer to any question you may have about this journal.

My co-worker made it off-hours so he's cool about me sharing it.

 Elon Musk has announced big, albeit confusing, plans for Twitter since he took over the social network last month.

Musk wants to vastly increase the revenue the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more ‚Äúfree speech,‚Äù which in some cases seems to mean restoring previously banned accounts like the one owned by former president Donald Trump.

But Musk‚Äôs plans for Twitter could put it in conflict with two of the biggest tech companies: Apple and Google.

## Tensions are brewing

One of the biggest risks to Musk‚Äôs vision for ‚ÄúTwitter 2.0‚Äù is the possibility that his changes violate Apple or Google‚Äôs app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.

Tensions are already brewing. Musk complained in a tweet just last week about app store fees that Google and Apple charge companies like Twitter.

‚ÄúApp store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly,‚Äù Musk tweeted. ‚ÄúIt is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.‚Äù In a follow-up post, he tagged the Department of Justice‚Äôs antitrust division, which is reportedly investigating app store rules.

His complaint is over the 15% to 30% cut Apple and Google take from purchases made inside apps, which could eat into the desperately-needed revenue from Musk‚Äôs plans for $8 per month from Twitter Blue subscriptions.

Over the weekend, Phil Schiller, the former head Apple marketing executive who still oversees the App Store, apparently deleted his widely-followed Twitter account with hundreds of thousands of followers.

* **Google employees say there‚Äôs growing anxiety internally that layoffs may be coming.**
* **A recent change in performance reviews along with increased chatter about cuts to travel budgets and swag is contributing to the concern.**
* **Google is coming off its weakest quarter for revenue growth since 2013, other than one period during the pandemic.**

 As industry-wide layoffs hit bigger tech names, some Google workers worry they‚Äôre next.

While Google has so far avoided the widespread job cuts that have hit tech companies, particularly those supported by a slumping ad market, internal anxiety is on the rise, according to documents viewed by CNBC and employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Alphabet executives have stressed the need to sharpen ‚Äúfocus,‚Äù bring down costs of projects and make the company 20% more efficient. There‚Äôs also been a recent change in performance reviews, and some employees point to declining travel budgets and less swag as signs that something bigger may be on the horizon.

In July, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai launched the ‚ÄúSimplicity Sprint‚Äù in an effort to bolster efficiency during an uncertain economic environment. Just a few miles up the road, Meta told employees this month that it‚Äôs laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, as the company reckons with declining ad revenue. Snap announced a 20% cut in August, and Twitter just slashed about half its workforce under the leadership of new owner Elon Musk. Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, HP said on Tuesday it plans to lay off 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next three years.

Google‚Äôs business hasn‚Äôt been hit as hard as many of its peers, but the combination of a potential recession, soaring inflation and rising interest rates is having a clear impact. Last month, the company said YouTube‚Äôs ad revenue shrank from a year earlier as Google generated its weakest period of growth since 2013, other than one quarter during the pandemic. Google said at the time that it would significantly reduce headcount growth in the fourth quarter.

The crypto market, which put a dent in Google‚Äôs latest results, has fallen even further with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, leading to increased concerns about industry contagion.

**Is $ZM a fading company?**

$ZM stock is now at its lowest since Jan 2020. 

The company was issued in April 2019 at the price of **62$** a stock in **NASDAQ**, reached its highest during COVID in 2020 at a stock price of **588$**, and since then made a decline to its current price of **77$.**

$ZM was founded in 2011 and launched in 2013 by Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive. The company offers Zoom meetings via video, voice, and chats. The company makes working through a call or chat easy and accessible through the app‚Äôs special features, enabling sharing of images, videos, audio files, and content on a desktop or a laptop. 

$ZM started to accelerate when COVID hit, providing an effective and accessible way to continue working, studying, and hosting events online through lockdowns. 

The company also provides Zoom Contact Centre, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Developer platform. 

**So what happened to $ZM?** 

Maybe it‚Äôs the company struggling to adapt to a non-pandemic reality. Or maybe there are competitors with greater name recognition that gives them an advantage in the field.

With $ZM growth many competitors entered the game like Google meets and even META. These are huge companies with a large user base community.

Activision has been trading near 52 week high of $86 for most of the last year with hopes of Microsoft acquiring the company. 

&gt; **Microsoft transaction**

&gt; As announced on January 18, 2022, Microsoft plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share in an all-cash
transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and completion of regulatory review. The
transaction, which is expected to close in Microsoft‚Äôs fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, has been approved by the boards
of directors of both Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and by Activision Blizzard‚Äôs stockholders


There has been a lot of drama about it and the deal seems to be on hold indefinitely... until EU decides that it's kosher. 


Recently though there has been some worrying news involving Activision. 

[Activision Blizzard games to go offline in China after NetEase deal falls through](https://www.ft.com/content/2d3a2351-8c19-4e11-bf16-54d05a668840)


&gt; China is the world‚Äôs largest gaming market, but foreign developers need a local partner to distribute their games in the country. Beijing also heavily censors gaming content and controls the number of new releases through a licensing system.

&gt; Activision Blizzard said on Thursday it was unable to reach a deal to renew a licensing agreement with NetEase, one of China‚Äôs largest game developers and publishers, which has distributed the games in the country for years.

&gt; The California-based company said last week that the NetEase agreement in dispute accounted for about 3 per cent of its net revenues last year, translating to roughly $264mn in sales.

[Here is the latest earning report](https://investor.activision.com/static-files/67c7ad10-e540-4152-a3e4-5323b329920a)


&gt; For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, Activision Blizzard‚Äôs net revenues presented in accordance with GAAP were
$1.78 billion, as compared with $2.07 billion for the third quarter of 2021. GAAP net revenues from digital channels were
$1.61 billion. GAAP operating margin was 27%. GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.55, as compared with $0.82 for
the third quarter of 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, Activision Blizzard‚Äôs operating margin was 34% and earnings per diluted
share was $0.68, as compared with $0.89 for the third quarter of 2021.
Activision Blizzard generated $257 million in operating cash flow for the quarter as compared with $521 million for the
third quarter of 2021.


Stock is trading at its current price just with hopes of the Microsoft deal, which to me seems be getting more and more unlikely.


With relatively poor performance and a shrinking market, Blizzard may well drop down to its 52 week low of $56 or even lower.

On Nov 15, the three major U.S. stock indexes closed in positive territory Tuesday, with the Dow up 0.17%, the NASDAQ up 1.45%, and the S&amp;P 500 up 0.87%. All three indexes pared gains in midday trading, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow briefly turning negative after a sudden missile attack in Poland and a surge in risk aversion.

The US producer price index (PPI) rose less than expected in October, both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis, clearly showing the broader trend of slowing inflation growth in the US and increasing the likelihood that the Fed will slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

Semiconductor and software Platforms were among the top gainers, while technology companies mostly gained, with Google, NVidia, and Meta Platforms up more than 2% and Apple and Tesla up more than 1%.

SEA rose 36.05% as Q3 revenue beat expectations, the loss was much lower than consensus, and it cut full-year booking guidance to US $2.6 billion to US $2.8 billion from US $2.9 billion to US $3.1 billion; 7,000 jobs, or 10% of the workforce, have been cut in the past six months. Tencent Music rose 30.56 percent as overall results solidly beat expectations, with paying online music users growing 19.8 percent year on year to a record 85.3 million. On the technical side, SE had a breakaway gap on earning yesterday while still having a downtrend consistency. Both MACD line &amp; MACD signal line are still under 0 while its MACD histogram is moving upward.

[**BABA**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-BABA/)

.

BABA had a breakaway gap above SMA50 and stayed above it. After forming a high volume Doji, BABA is highly extended on the daily chart and may experience certain level of correction today. It broke and closed above $78.64, which was the high on 10/18.

[**BILI**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-BILI/)

After gaping up above SMA50, PDD also stayed above it. However, it could not break the significant pivot point at $17.14, so this will still be the resistance on the upside.

On the other hand, with the loose monetary policy and its low valuation, China stocks are worth a look towards the end of the year.

145,1668457473,yvbi15,1,"Hey peoples,  


By now most have seen the post by u/MikasalsTheBestWaifu regarding AST Space Mobile.   


In good WSB fashion, the kid has leveraged his $470,000 position with 100% margin (another $470k) for a cool $1M-ish into ASTS. I won't go into extreme DD around the company but here is the summary that matters:  


1) ASTS is a player in the Satellite Communications (much like Starlink) 

2) Unlike Starlink they do not require special equipment to receive the signal and their tech can be utilized with any regular phone

3) They will accomplish this by launching MASSIVE satellites with +600 SQFT area. Bluewalker 3 (the catalyst behind all this craziness) has been launched in September and is now confirmed to be ""unfurled"" (i.e. unraveled) and ready to be tested in earnest. Check out the size of this bad boy

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9m6ytpf4zz91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bcbd63527a157aa801a847be06e6ffb0679b9fe

4) This is a HUGE catalyst to the company as it shifts the investment proposition from a binary opportunity of the ""tech works?"" to a scalability and ramp up problem. It is no exaggeration to say the next coming days and weeks will be the most important in the company's history

5) Major industry players just as Vodafone, AT&amp;T, Rakuten and others are already invested in ASTS and many have even released videos with their CEOs/CTOs/COOs demonstrating their confidence into ASTS tech and the overall company. You can find them on the company's Youtube channel.   


At this first glance, we might be tempted to discard this as another run-of-the-mill YOLO but with some DD of you own you can quickly arrive to a different conclusion. You can realize that there is currently a huge tug of war between retail investor and a large short fund, which has ""double-downed"" today as an attempt to stem the insane pre-market rally of +20%. Their efforts were successful as the stock pulled back to -5% at this time of this writing.   


However that came at a cost.  


Below is the funding rate for ASTS short positions. Notice how the funding fee (now at 20%) has been inching up since Nov 9th when the speculation that Bluewalker 3 had unfurled successfully started to be confirmed by the astronomer community. There are currently ZERO stock available to cover and some users are starting to reporting their brokers reaching out to them to borrow their shares. Any re-borrowing will come at least 25-30% rate if not higher.

At the same time today we saw a record number of submissions for institutional buys at pre-market including Goldman Sachs, Vanguard, JP Morgan and others as evidenced below. Notice today's filling date on the last 9 fillings. 

https://preview.redd.it/s0um2x6w3zz91.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=205ed3e7a60dd576bc2a2a0795ebcacb82ddcced

Why is today such a big deal?  


Cause the earnings call when the unfurl will be announced is happening TODAY at 5pm. The company has already announced via social this morning that the deployment was successful and 3 hours later a record short position was reinforced with the borrowed shares mentioned above.  


The short sellers are panicking and with good reason. When companies migrate from binary thesis (""is this even possible?"") to a scale/ramp-up problem, they are usually met with large amount of trench funding. This has happened with a multitude of companies such as SpaceX, AirBnB. Uber, Google, etc etc. We are exactly at that point with ASTS where the technology is weeks or even days of being completely validated which will continue to act as a catalyst.   


Now combined that with the fact that nearly 40% (that's right FORTY percent) of the entire float is short. When you consider institutional ownership + insider holdings (which by the way have not sold a single share since public listed other than for tax purposes) you can see how this can become a powder keg as the funding rates spike.  


With a functional Bluewalker3, ASTS will literally become the new leader of Satellite Communications, even surpassing Starlink in growth potential. ASTS will move away from ""will it work"" to ""will it scale"" and large positions from outside investors are soon to follow. 

I'm in üëç

October CPI rose 7.7% y/y in October, better than the expected 7.9%, compared with 8.2% in September; core CPI rose 6.3% y/y, better than the expected 6.5%. The ""entrenched inflation"" theory has faded as prices growth in the new and used vehicles and medical care categories slowed m/m. And as consumers gradually feel the pain from Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate-hiking (it takes time for monetary policy to reach consumers) + recession fears depress spending, providing the potential downward path for future inflation. However, investors should keep that in mind recession risk is looming.

On the other hand, Democrats retained control of the Senate after holding Nevada seat over the weekend, the House outcome is still undecided (though Republicans likely win). Many believed that Republicans will win both chambers easily due to high inflation and multiple large bills passed by Democrats, but it seems untrue. Americans are still optimistic about future under Democrats‚Äô leadership.¬† 

Big things happened in coin industry last week. The world‚Äôs second-largest coin exchange, FTX, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as the company faced insolvency and liquidity crisis. Thanks to that, BT coin currently is trading around $16,000 and ETF is around $1,200. Investors doubt that coin is a reliable asset under recent uncertainties.

**Chip stocks jumped, can Nvidia's earnings report be a surprise or a scare?**

[Semiconductor stocks](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/semiconductor-stocks/)

As risk appetite rebounded, high-growth chip stocks experienced big rally last week, ASML jumped nearly 23%, TSMC, Lam Research rose more than 18%, Nvidia, AMD rose more than 15%.

TSMC's October said last Thursday it recorded the company‚Äôs second highest-ever monthly sales in October, with NT$210.27 billion ($6.61 billion), up 56% year-on-year and up 1% m/m amid demand worries. Analysts said growing demand for smartphones, high-performance computing (HPC) devices and automotive electronics boosted shipments of chips made on TSMC's 5nm process.

AMD launched its 4th-Gen EPYC Genoa Zen 4 processors for data center last week and said Microsoft‚Äôs Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Corp would be some of its customers. Genoa makes significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency compared with its previous chip, ""What that means for enterprises and for cloud data centers is that it translates into lower CAPEX, lower OPEX and lower total cost of ownership,"" said CEO Lisa Su.

Nvidia‚Äôs new A800 GPU chips, an alternative to A100 GPU, started selling in China last week, which complies with the US export restrictions amid ‚Äútech decoupling‚Äù between US-China. The company will release its financial results after the bell on Wednesday, Nvidia‚Äôs share price has risen nearly 60% from its October low. Although market sentiment has picked up, the fundamentals are essential for the company valuation, how‚Äôs latest GPU 4090 selling, the inventory level of legacy GPUs and forward guidance are critical, investors will carefully watch whether the chip stocks‚Äô rally can be sustained.

**Industrial, banking and oil stocks continue to rise steadily, Walmart‚Äôs earnings are coming**

[Banking Stocks](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/screen?q=GICS%20Industry%20is%20Bank%3B)

[Oil Stocks](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/oil-and-Gas-Stocks/)

Industrial, banking and oil stocks continue to rise last week as Fed may start slowing the speed of rate-hiking. 

Among industrial stocks, Caterpillar and Nucor rose nearly 4%, Vulcan Materials rose over 5%, and GE rose over 6%. With Democrats retaining control of the Senate, Biden‚Äôs spending on infrastructure continues to play out.

Among bank stocks, JPMorgan Chase rose more than 3.5%, Bank of America rose more than 4%, Morgan Stanley rose nearly 7%, Citi rose more than 11%. With lower treasury rates, investors expect big banks' non-interest segment (wealth management, investment banking, etc) is expected to see a recovery.

Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum rose more than 1%, of which Exxon Mobil, Chevron shares are at record highs. As China loosened some Covid zero rules, investors expect the demand for oil &amp; gas will increase, which pushes the oil prices higher. 

It is worth mentioning that Walmart will announce its earnings on Tuesday, investors can evaluate the change in consumers' spending habits amid inflation and recession fears, and it whether improves or deteriorates, which can be a barometer for the health of the US economy.¬†","Market Weekly Recap: FAAMG, Chip, Software Sectors jumped heavily, coin market tumbled",1.0,2022-11-14 14:08:33

Now speaking about Tesla, I think this Insulin Eli Lilly fake account thing in twitter will have a correlation issue   [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/)  Will lead to a freaking huge lawsuit against Elon's groups and team. The One key part of that legal landscape is **Section 230**, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content ( right from google search ) clearly states immunity.

That's my new line of research. maybe a good long term put but the cost seems so high do to volatility that there is no meat on the bone.

I've also never made a post on this sub before, so go easy on me.

I did basically zero thought on that, beyond looking at the 5 year chart and seeing that it was a $17-$20/share company pre-covid, ballooned up to $75-90/share, and then plummeted to $3.76 when I purchased it. Then I was sad because 13% layoffs announced. Then I realized that a company that pays a salary/bennies in a field that's normally 100% commission (realtors) is bound to attract lots of dead weight, so maybe firing a bunch of people from time to time ain't such a bad idea after all. And dropping the iBuyer flipping division makes sense and was overdue (I could go on about why that business model is only going to work when/if a rising tide is lifting all boats, and rapidly) 

Then, today, somehow it's up 30%.

I see on google that a bunch people here YOLO'd at $75 and $40. So as I'm making this thread, I feel good about my $3.76, but feeling bad that I didn't full YOLO it with my entire life savings. All well. 

As I text a friend of mine my thoughts on buying more, he brings up that their little earnings report thing is expecting them to finally turn a net profit in 2024. So a tech company that's THIS old is STILL playing the ""oh don't worry, we will be profitable some day"" game, which makes me want to run for the hills. But then on the other hand it's a pre-boom $17/share company, $75/share mid-boom, and $4.25 at the bust. Is the most plausible logical valuation not likely to be closer to the $17/share figure than the $75/share figure? 

Yup, no idea, my day-job work in the financial sector has (perhaps surprisingly) little intersection with evaluating individual stock values, so while I have some sense of the way things tend to flow, the numbers themselves have little real meaning. 

I derived the number of outstanding shares from the market cap (you just divide, right?) and concluded that this was pre-covid about a $1.8b company, topping out at $9.7b nominal valuation mid-boom, now at a tad under $500m.

# About Netlist (NLST)

[**Netlist**](https://netlist.com/), which was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Irvine, California, is a leading provider of high-performance modular memory subsystems to the world‚Äôs premier OEMs. The company specializes in hybrid memory, combining DRAM and NAND flash raw materials to create memory solutions. Their patented memory technologies provide superior performance and high density at a cost-efficient price, with use spanning a broad variety of markets and functions ‚Äì a market that only expands as technology use grows.

Netlist has a long history of being the first to market with disruptive new products. For example, they were the first to develop the load-reduced DIMM, HyperCloud¬Æ, which was based on Netlist‚Äôs distributed buffer architecture. This architecture was later adopted by the industry for DDR4 LRDIMM. Netlist was also the first to bring NAND flash to the memory channel with their NVvault¬Æ NVDIMM. These innovative products were built on Netlist‚Äôs early pioneering work in areas such as embedding passives into printed circuit boards to free up board real estate; doubling densities via quad-rank double data rate (DDR) technology, and other off-chip technology advances that result in improved performance and lower costs compared to conventional memory.

Netlist is continuing this tradition with the introduction of HybriDIMM, the industry‚Äôs first Storage Class Memory product built on commodity DRAM and flash. HybriDIMM is the first SCM product to operate in current Intel¬Æ x86 servers without BIOS and hardware changes, and the first unified DRAM-NAND solution that scales memory to terabyte storage capacities and accelerates storage to nanosecond memory speeds.

Netlist has a broad portfolio of patents, many of which are seminal, in the areas of hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication, and load reduction, among others. The size of Netlist‚Äôs patent portfolio reflects its extensive research and development over the years, as well as its history of bringing innovative new products to market.

Netlist‚Äôs strategy is to combine its unique board-level intellectual property with a thorough understanding of semiconductor building blocks and system-level applications to deliver performance, cost, and time-to-market advantages to OEMs. This strategy is made capable with state-of-the-art, wholly owned, ISO- and OSHAS-certified manufacturing and testing facilities in Suzhou, China.

# A Forerunner To What Could Be America‚Äôs Largest Patent Infringement In History

Google was presented with Netlist technology in the mid-2000s under an NDA. Google test-drove the product, and they liked it a lot. What they did not like and fought against was the cost Netlist wanted (per Google‚Äôs argument). Netlist alleges that they decided to steal the product by making it themselves or coercing other manufacturers to create copycat versions of the technology to bypass any royalties to Netlist. In 2009 Netlist officially brought forth a lawsuit. The judge in the 2009 case ordered a random cross-section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. In that time frame (the mid-2000s to now), Google went from being one of several competing search engine/email providers (AOL, Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, Bing, etc.) to have a practical monopoly on the entire market due to the broader storage and retrieval capabilities. This leads Netlist to assume that their intellectual property is one of the direct reasons why.

Netlist has 130+ patents, and with all ongoing litigation, there are roughly a dozen patents in question across Micron, Samsung, and Google. The biggest of which is the 912 patent.

Google's priority was to invalidate Netlist‚Äôs patents since they had no argument for innocence (already caught red-handed with the technology described in the 912 patent specifically). With this and other patent disputes arising, certain authority figures in law and patent litigation (many of whom overlap with the same legal council that has represented Google and others in the past) arranged to create the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) as a way to capitalize on the complex and growing field of intellectual property law. This board was formally founded in 2012. The PTAB is supposed to represent an objective third-party resource to review patent validity and make the legal landscape much cleaner to navigate for district courts handling disputes. In reality, it seems to be an entity fueled by big tech to invalidate patents to get out of paying appropriate royalties for fair use. The PTAB is paid case by case, so they are unfairly incentivized to take on cases. Moreover, the judges have been discovered to regularly get kickbacks or bonuses on patents they can invalidate. These IPRs take a year on average. When a big tech company steals a smaller company‚Äôs intellectual property, it will use the PTAB to request a stay on the case pending the review. It is easy and understandable for a district judge, who is paid a salary no matter how many cases they see, to accept the stay as it simply cleans their docket for the moment. Then post-review, a district judge will often adopt the PTAB‚Äôs decision as their own without question. For reasons you may speculate, district judges have the authority to question or disregard PTAB at their discretion but often do not. Big tech has deep pockets and is happy to pay for this service as it is often much cheaper in the long run than paying fair royalties.

The PTAB grants reviews on over 70% of all requests, knowing that conservatively 50% of these reviews stand no chance of invalidation in whole or even part. Also, the PTAB allows multiple companies to request and have practically identical IPRs granted when reviewing similar patents - most of the time only enabling more time to be wasted at the detriment of the patent holder. In several instances, these little companies go out of business, allowing big tech companies to absorb their patents whether invalidated or not.

Netlist is a rare example of a company that has only improved over time despite the odds and has more cash on hand, better sales, stronger hiring numbers, and increased r&amp;d in the meantime. So they are more than able to go the distance and see justice served.

# The ‚Äò912 Patent

A description of the '912 patent is [**found here**](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/08/04/netlist-progresses-in-samsung-dimm-patent-case-with-google-in-its-sights/)**.**  


&gt;The ‚Äò912 patent refers to the use of rank multiplication in an LRDIMM (Long Range DIMM) memory module. Such DIMMs can have four ranks or blocks of memory, and the patent describes IP to present the LRDIMM logically as only having two ranks, thus getting over system memory controller limits on the maximum rank count.  
Agni Research explained ‚ÄúNetlist asserts that the ‚Äò912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning-fast search results. The ‚Äò912 patent played a large part in Google‚Äôs dominance in search.‚Äù

Spanning a decade (which is unprecedented), Netlist and Google have fought over the 912 patent. It went through several reviews, appeals, etc. until being validated at the federal circuit in 2020 unanimously as SEMINAL and valid. The status of seminal indicates that it is a patented product that gives users a tremendous advantage and thus, explaining why Google went from one of many to the monopoly of the industry making trillions since. This is unwavering. Google withdrew its right to appeal further to the Supreme Court as this historic rule 36 style verdict (where the federal circuit affirmed lower court's rulings without any input or amendment) has never been overturned at the Supreme Court level. Google then tried to invalidate all 78 claims of the 912 patent for past infringement (accepting the claims and 912 validity from the time it was recognized in court and post-any ‚Äúamendments‚Äù done by Netlist to update/rewrite the claims as they are relevant today). So 2021 to the present, as well as future royalties Google acknowledges and will pay for. They are simply playing damage control on how much money this is going to cost them - and a guilty verdict on past infringement spanning over a decade can be worth billions.

The next battle was with ‚Äúclaim 16 intervening rights‚Äù, as it was the only claim out of 78 to survive back to inception/infringement and is worth a substantial amount. As momentum built towards the claim 16 hearing in November 2021, the night before the hearing Judge Armstrong in the Northern District of California stayed the case for no clear reason for 3 months (it was assumed personal undetermined reasons). 3 months later she did a second consecutive stay. At that time she was offloading several cases and not hearing any, so it was likely for personal reasons and unrelated to the case itself.

This delay was unacceptable, so we switched judges successfully to Judge Seeborg. Seeborg went through with the claim 16 intervening rights hearing and ruled in favor of Netlist that Google is on the hook for 4-rank DDR4 DIMMs (a product that was used by Google between 2014-2020).

Google was successful in limiting its exposure by avoiding 8-rank and 16-rank DDR4 DIMMs. A settlement would likely not come close to the actual cost of all infringed products multiplied over years, but this claim 16 ddr4 rank 4 victory alone could manifest in the largest patent infringement in US history (the current record is $2.54 Billion).

# Google Is Not The Only One In Trouble

In related cases within the same timeframe, Netlist sued SK Hynix, Inphi, Micron, and Samsung (amongst others like Diablo and Sandisk). Samsung, in particular, had a contract with Netlist from 2015-2020 ish, but early on there was compelling evidence that Samsung was in breach of the contract and not fulfilling its obligations to Netlist. So Netlist unilaterally withdrew their contract and Samsung fought it in a breach of contract suit, ultimately losing as they were proven to be in breach in December 2021. It was tricky because Netlist was only allowed to give limited info to a jury at that trial and the jury saw the contract was breached and should be voided but awarded no damages. The jury deliberated quickly on a Friday evening and it was seen as a miscarriage of justice as you cannot have a breach without there being clear damages. The judge came back and granted Netlist nominal damages so that the breach would be legal and binding in February 2022. Samsung is currently in appeals with this suit but it‚Äôs not a strong case for them at all.

To throw another variable in the mix, SK Hynix in spring 2021 got to the Markman Claim Construction trial (despite requesting stays for ongoing IPRs) and they were forced to decide between the discovery of their records or settling outside of court. An overwhelming majority (90%+) of these cases settle outside of court around this event. When companies run out of time-wasting ammo, they don‚Äôt want their dirty laundry seen in the litigation public domain (because it's either a losing battle or possibly because it could further incriminate them with a plethora of other less-than-ethical business practices). Four weeks after the Markman hearing SK Hynix settled. $40 million in damages (pretty nominal) and a $640 million product sharing agreement so Netlist could have access to SK Hynix manufacturing at a discount to sell and pursue other smaller markets. This has already proven to be worth more than the initial agreement and has been very advantageous for both Netlist and SK Hynix.

Google was on the verge of either showing its cards or settling. Samsung had no solid contract to stand on, SK Hynix already settled, and Inphi's trial was withdrawn without prejudice. Perhaps Inphi agreed to share incriminating information about Google/others on behalf of Netlist. Their infringement was limited in scope and they were since bought out by Marvell. Begs the question that maybe they wanted to avoid carrying over legal issues to the new firm. This is yet to be determined, but it was done without prejudice, meaning Netlist can always reinstate the lawsuit if they wish. Additionally, Netlist's verbiage has changed on motions filed from ‚Äúon belief‚Äù to ‚Äúon information and belief‚Äù - it leads us to speculate that Inphi could be providing information. The micron trial was also gaining momentum for several patents and was recently added to those that infringe on the 912 as well. Half the patents are in the West District of Texas (where there is a stay on the case currently) and the other half is being tried in the East District of Texas with judges who are not as prone to stay - more on that to come.

The 6 months of stagnation really hurt Netlist's momentum but morale was still high. Then Samsung blindsides us with a Delaware suit against Netlist where they requested a 912 inter partes review (a NEW trial proceeding to review 912's patentability) with the PTAB - something that was already reviewed 5 times and went to the highest court in the land and deemed SEMINAL meaning transformative to the industry. This particular product cut energy costs by 50-95% and significantly increased search/retrieval speed. No wonder Google became the monopoly they are today. So this was very puzzling because why would Samsung request this 912 review considering that Netlist wasn‚Äôt even suing Samsung over that patent?

...Moreover, since the patent is already valid, it CAN NOT be overturned, but Seeborg's ruling on claim 16 potentially can. The Google case was stayed for 90 days until there could be clarification as to what exactly is going on with this tactic.

# Recent &amp; Developing Events - Fall 2022

The PTAB in October 2022 disappointingly granted an IPR (not surprising given their unobjective big tech bias) on the basis that the claim 16 definition of ‚Äúrank‚Äù multiplication differs ever so slightly from a definition of rank used in one of Netlist's older patents. So it‚Äôs a simple wording technicality. It‚Äôs difficult because rank wasn‚Äôt introduced until the DDR4 DIMMs so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs being fought over. Same technology and method, just some use more material. By definition the core requirement of rank is to have at least 2 or more memory devices in order to wire them to achieve high memory capacity with lower DIMMs‚Ä¶but never only 1 DIMM because that doesn‚Äôt help to achieve low-cost high memory capacity - which is the entire aim of the patent 912. Samsung argues the definition should mean ‚Äúone or more‚Äù whereas Netlist argues ‚Äútwo or more‚Äù as the use of rank implies that there is a row (or more than one). According to Wikipedia, ‚Äúa memory rank is a set of DRAM chips connected to the same chip select, which are therefore accessed simultaneously‚Äù. Even the internet uses the word SET! A set can never imply a single unit. A single-rank DIMM has one SET of memory chips that is accessed while writing or reading from the memory. A dual-rank DIMM is similar to having 2 single-rank DIMMs on the same module, with only one rank accessible at the time. A quad-rank DIMM is, effectively, 2 dual-rank DIMMs on the same module. Samsung is trying to change the definition or sneakily imply that Netlist is only entitled to single-chip servers potentially, instead of stacked servers which is what Google primarily uses.

It is more disappointing by how obviously it appears that Samsung and Google are parties of interest. This has been overlooked by PTAB since Samsung skirted around any direct answer to there being an indemnification agreement between the two. To explain PTABs blind eye to this sort of thing, in 2019 in an unrelated case against SEVEN Networks, LLC, Google was able to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù the PTAB that its parent company Alphabet, which oversees and controls Google, was not a real party of interest- so go figure. This is one of many examples of all that is wrong with the PTAB as an institution, and why the tribunal is hopelessly broken and in need of a complete teardown and rebuild.

On 11/3/22, Irell and Manella attorney Philip Warrick requested that the PTAB convene a Precedential Opinion Panel in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 2 (revision10) to rehear the panel decision, asses the basis of Google‚Äôs real-party-of-interest (RPI) status as well as the ‚Äúsecond bite at the apple‚Äù standard prohibiting consecutive wasteful IPRs on the same patent, and REVERSE the panel‚Äôs institution decision. The facts presented are clear that the PTAB committed a blatant injustice in allowing the IPR on the merits of the claim alone and the fact that Samsung admitted in the declaratory judgment action complaint to requesting the IPR in order to indemnify Google upon Google‚Äôs request. Clear party of interest. PTAB failed to have Samsung defend that Google is NOT a party of interest - as it was not Netlist‚Äôs burden of proof in a typical procedure. Mr. Warrick presented 6 case study references to show evidence that PTAB acted unorthodoxly and antagonistically to establish a precedent. Even if the odds are down to a coin flip, it is very promising!

It is important to know that Google and Samsung have worked together often in the past decade to muddy IP litigations, double dip on time-wasting opportunities, and even fund each other's lawsuit defenses. There is no limit to the deceptive practices they are comfortable using. This includes incorrect annotations on word-limited motions to unfairly use more words to argue their case, manipulatively using the PTAB while being clear parties of interest together, lobbying legislation and political/judicial individuals, etc. If we simple retail investors can see this from publicly available information, then so can the ethical honorable legal representatives working to see justice prevail. Needless to say, reform is absolutely needed. With this news, Google and Netlist agreed to stay the Google case until the Samsung case wraps up as this is the final straw Google has to stand on. The consolation prize to all this is that Samsung was cornered into the Eastern District of Texas with judge Gilstrap.

Judge Gilstrap has seen over 25% of the nation's entire patent litigation cases! He does not slow down for unnecessary time wasters and has a history of denying PTAB IPR-based requests for stay. Samsung and Micron are caught up in Gilstrap's web, unable to escape despite their many requests to stay or transfer to another district. Judge Gilstrap is adamant that the similar patents across Micron and Samsung be tried together for efficiency even though a few of Micron's patents are tied in the Western District of Texas and currently ‚Äústayed‚Äù.

As of today, Gilstrap is moving forward with the trials and Samsung just had their Markman Trial with Magistrate Payne (a pretrial hearing in the U.S. District Court during which a judge examines evidence from all parties on the appropriate meanings of relevant keywords used in a patent claim) on November 4th, 2022 for a basket of patents not involving the 912. On 11/17 there‚Äôs a case management conference scheduled to set up a Markman Trial date for the 912 and other patents with Gilstrap.

A wild card in all this is that Gilstrap's daughter sadly passed away recently. I am unsure of how much time he will take away to grieve. Family comes first.

If Gilstrap can push through and get one or both Samsung and Micron to be compelled into discovery, the chances are strong that they will offer a settlement instead of showing their dirty laundry just as SK Hynix did. The hope is Gilstrap will not be entertaining any more stays despite ongoing IPRs on some patents. Gilstrap is the authority, not the PTAB so ultimately nothing they do matters if Gilstrap is adamant about keeping the case moving, which outside of his family tragedy, he has shown no desire to waste time.

Judge Gilstrap often utilizes the expertise of Magistrate Payne in the same ED of Texas to oversee a majority of Markman claim construction hearings. Judge Payne has construed a significantly HIGH number of patent claim terms (over 8,200 terms as of 2022) - the highest claim construction record of all time compared to other judges in past polls or rankings. Moreover, in terms of actual Markman trials conducted, Judge Payne ranks among the top five federal judges, magistrates, or districts, who have conducted the most hearings of all time. Gilstrap is also in that rank.

Payne and Gilstrap have already had cases against Netlist‚Äôs infringers (Google, Samsung, etc) before, and they are NOT friendly to them. As one example, back in 2014 in SimpleAir, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., et al, 2:13-cv-416-JRG, an east Texas jury entered a damages verdict against Google for $85 million for patent infringement. In this lawsuit, most of the defendants, including Microsoft, chose to settle. Google, however, proceeded to trial. On Jan 18th of that year, the East Texas jury entered a verdict against Google finding that it infringed on the ‚Äò914 and ‚Äò433 patents which were deemed valid. The jury struggled at first to reach a determination on the issue of damages of which Google moved for a new trial on all issues. The Honorable Judge Gilstrap DENIED Google‚Äôs motion and set dates for jury selection and trial on just the issue of damages on March 17th and by the 19th the jury entered its official verdict for $85 million!

In two separate recent cases involving Samsung (Uniloc 2017 LLC v. Samsung Elecs. America, Inc in 2020 and Staton Techiya, LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co 2022), Judge Payne repeatedly denied Samsungs request for stay due to ongoing appeals or third-party IPRs, respectively.

On 11/4 the Markman Claim Construction hearing took place over the 054, 506, 339, 918, 060, and 160 patents. Payne asked several questions to Samsung throughout the trial every time Samsung presented arguments and he was mildly arguing with them. The only patent that Payne seemed to question for clarification on the netlist side was the 339 patent. Netlist attorney answered very matter of fact. Samsung's attorney was very long-winded. For perspective, the more the judge needs to ask questions, the worse it is. Claim construction needs to be simple and concise. Not a complicated word salad consisting of several paragraphs. It appears Samsung tried really hard to finagle things to their advantage and it seems Payne was not entertaining it. We look to hearing in the near future about Payne‚Äôs final decisions on claims and move forward from there.

**In the meantime, all court Jury trials have been proposed and go as follows:**  


* May 2023 - Samsung Texas Jury Trial over non-912 patents
* May 2023 - Germany Jury trial (Samsung, Google, and Micron)
* January 2024 - Micron Texas Jury trial
* February 2025 - Samsung/Google Delaware Jury Trial

Often these disputes settle outside of court before Jury trial. Netlist does not have the resources to continue paying legal fees and support a weak market demand (as seen in q3 2022 results and hinted that will continue for one or two more quarters) if nothing were to be resolved until the latest trial date established without having to dilute shares or dip into their line of credit available. That is something to be aware of but not frightened by. Many opportunities for settlement before that time. It is safe to assume a strong stock price recovery within 7-8 months from now with the hopes of the Samsung Texas case going to a jury trial or settling outside of court.

The first company to settle will lose the least. All other companies will likely fold shortly afterward. Once Samsung folds, Google will too. In my opinion, it is not a question of guilt or innocence at this point, but of who won and how much the winner will be compensated. Since they have been fighting so hard for so long, it leads many to believe the damages and future licensing could be substantial across all companies.

# Future Stock Price Speculation

To emphasize a similar legal battle against Googe we must understand the Vringo case 2012-2014. Vringo owned 2 patents on AdWords and AdSense (software that increases search engine optimization for advertisements on search engines) and the judge ruled in favor of Vringo and it went to a jury trial. The jury awarded damages (30 million) and a percentage of royalties moving forward. This was re-examined by the USPTO (now PTABs job) and both patents were able to survive the IPR intact (but not seminal). It was then taken through the first round of appeals on the merits of the whole case. They agreed with the district judges ruling and jury ruling and even doubled the original royalty percentage!

Then in the federal circuit of appeals, one judge out of 3 showed reasonable doubt to the patent validity (basically saying the patents weren‚Äôt special and they were so easy a caveman could do it) and everything fell apart and all winnings reversed. The company still exists but went private and rebranded. It was a major rug pull after everything was won and verified many times.

Our 912 patent has survived where Vringo‚Äôs patents failed at the federal circuit of appeals. However, this is a tactic that worries me with all other patents not already seminally verified by the federal circuit of appeals if there is not a settlement outside of court.

It is worth noting that the single judge to discredit Vringo‚Äôs patent was Judge Raymond Chen. He was appointed to the Federal Circuit of Appeals in 2013 by President Obama. Obama‚Äôs biggest political donor: Google.

Even if this isn‚Äôt the biggest settlement in history, it‚Äôs still substantial and the future licensing is worth more. With settlements in place, Netlist should be deep in the black and placed back on the NASDAQ instead of staying OTC as soon as they reinstate a Board of Directors. Plus, Netlist has an ace in the hole with future Hybridimm technology of which the CEO, Chuck Hong, says is worth more than $10B annually and already patent-protected. Netlist has all the makings of being the industry leader in memory storage technology. Search engines, streaming services, email, social media, cars, etc all need this technology and many are already using Netlist's tech without properly paying. They will all pay especially with the legitimacy of these litigations behind us.

As stated previously 90%+ of these cases settle before jury trial and before discovery into the infringer's records. So that‚Äôs the rough timeline to anticipate prior to jury trials listed above.

For perspective, in 1999 Qualcomm sued/won against Ericsson and Motorola in a seminal patent victory and within 12 months post-settlement the stock went from $3-$90 (settling longer term around the $60 range). This was during the dot com bubble when the rest of the market crashed. I anticipate similar results with Netlist given enough timeline post settlements.

I compare Netlist's technology similarly to how revolutionary NVDA tech was back in 2016. In 5 years NVDA went from roughly $20 to $700. If Netlist can garner the right licensing and their future tech is as magnificent as Hong states, then that‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility.

In desperation, Google had an agreement with the government and the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in Sept 2022 to pay for microchips to be built by SkyWater to use as open-source research and development for future microchip technology. Why would Google be so generous? Perhaps it‚Äôs their Hail Mary attempt to design around Netlist patents so they don‚Äôt hemorrhage money paying for fair use. My thoughts are if they haven‚Äôt designed around the tech already in the last 15 years, they won‚Äôt be able to now. And you better believe they‚Äôve tried.

Netlist is a true David and Goliath story where big tech has fought harder than ever to not have to pay for Netlist tech. Why fight so hard if it‚Äôs worthless? Why settle with other companies often and not Netlist? Most litigation + appeals take 2 to 4 years. This has lasted more than 3 times longer than that and still counting.

The risk of Netlist losing and getting paid nothing is not even relevant as Google accepts the terms of the 912 patent and their infringement from 2021 to the present. Netlist is not a patent troll and they have an underlying business that is flourishing despite the litigations. The risk is more so to the time and patience of retail investors. On OTC there‚Äôs also the element of broker/dealer price discretions as well as more manipulation from market makers who like to trade round lots consecutively throughout the day to walk the price down.

The way I see it, this is a powder keg waiting to explode and these prices are very enticing. If there‚Äôs a worst-case scenario event and things drag out as long as possible, the underlying company itself in a bad economic environment is still worth $0.80 - $1.20. So it‚Äôs not likely to go to 0 and go bankrupt.

The stock hit $10 on the Sk Hynix settlement and the exuberance of the noose closing in on google + others next. Progress has been made on all cases since that time only reinforcing the merits Netlist has on all fronts. The SK Hynix settlement was anticipated to be the weakest settlement of all current ongoing cases. The stays to the case for specific periods made the stock ripe for manipulation and impatience which is why the stock price has walked down most of the year (9 months of the last 12-month period have been in a stay). Many who are bullish long-term took the chance to trade the stock around the catalyst dates in the meantime, adding to short-term volatility. Longs will probably add more without selling the closer we get to finalized court decisions.

For me, it‚Äôs a no-brainer, easy to hold and I have time. For others, they must weigh the pros and cons of the entry price and duration of holding. I argue it‚Äôs a long-term hold with lots of tailwinds in the future. With positive earnings post settlement and relisting to NASDAQ, this could be astronomical as THEN institutional investors and FOMO retail will likely buy like crazy. Combine that with the short float outstanding and there‚Äôs truly no telling where the SP (stock price) goes.

Safe to assume $10 to $30 as a soft initial SP target POST settlements‚Ä¶which WILL most likely happen in time. Could be sooner rather than later and happen outside of court if these companies are cornered into discovery.

# A Final Message From [u/DaveySauce](https://www.reddit.com/u/DaveySauce/)

I‚Äôm happy to open up to any feedback or input on the matter as I didn‚Äôt discuss all the other relevant patents and progress made on that front.

Best of luck to all investors‚Ä¶but know that truly good investors are not as lucky as they are patient - relying on their wisdom and research and then simply succeeding on purpose. Warren Buffett said the stock market is a device that takes money from the impatient and gives it to the patient. Never invest more than you are willing to lose. Many investors bought in for pennies and are already in the black. For newer investors, they may be temporarily holding a bag but if they can manage their short-term emotions I have no doubt it will pay off 2-40x with enough time.

Just my opinion. This is not advice‚Ä¶ as it is merely stating the facts as I see them and why I remain happily invested and follow closely.",The Netlist (NLST) Saga: How One Company Is Taking On Big Tech Giants Like Google In A Case That Can Change History,1.0,2022-11-07 00:06:18
167,1667778783,yo6uyy,1,"Intro: The Trade Desk (TTD) is an American multinational technology company that specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users. All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.

1). Massive competition 

As stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.


2). The premium is too high

They have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can‚Äôt produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can‚Äôt produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.

3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads

We are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.
 
4). The guidance nail in the coffin

Guidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.

5). Bull thesis

This is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind 

7) TL;DR

$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.

8). Position.

I have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday. Yolo, food stamps or Ferraris lol.

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds ‚Äî high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them ‚Äî have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

173,1667519830,ylj3d3,1,"Unpopular opinion: oil prices will stay high until oil stocks go up

In a normal commodity cycle, the cure for high prices is high prices. However, that is no longer the case, and I will explain why I think that is the case. I will try to list sources where I can but a lot of this information has been synthesized over time and therefore you will just have to google some things. Even the sources I find will be articles I find on google to support my statements.

High prices do not necessarily create permanent demand destruction. Even in the worst parts of the 2008 recession, oil demand barely dropped. Not to mention that demand can recover and if the fed pivots, it can be quite inflationary at least for commodity prices where physical markets are tight.

Here is an article of which I only want to highlight a single sentence (but I figure I should include a source). 

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/oil-demand-price-coronavirus-world-bank/

‚ÄúIn 2008, the Great Recession led to demand falling by 0.66%‚Äù

That is nothing! But supply had already grown too much from the shale boom, leading to a supply/demand balance that favored the buyer. Compared to today, however, as the bottom half of the world is lifted out of poverty, they will consume more oil. They will go from bikes to motorcycles and motorcycles to cars. Let‚Äôs be real: they aren‚Äôt getting EVs anytime soon.

Furthermore,  as europe heads into an energy crisis and Russian gas is no longer an option due to nordstream explosions (only one pipeline left but it‚Äôs way smaller capacity than before), they will need to burn more oil and coal. This could lead to a lot of gas to oil switching https://bisoninterests.com/content/f/gas-to-oil-switching-‚Äì-winter-is-coming

I DONT WANT to hear any poorly framed arguments about european storage being full or TTF going negative. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Here is why anyone that tells you that europe will be fine with their storage doesn‚Äôt know what they are talking about: If you are driving cross country and start with a full tank that can get you 20% of the way there (being generous here), does that mean you can automatically make it coast to coast? No. You have to gas up. Likewise, getting through winter is the same. Gas storage cannot account for the entire winter. They need constant inflows. Heating oil, diesel and coal are just LNG without the infrastructure and therefore Europe will go for those next.

That being said, demand is ultimately very difficult to pin down. What I would like to focus on is supply.

Biden often complains about oil companies doing buybacks and dividends. Why? Because at these prices, dividends and buybacks get shareholders better return than growth at these multiples. Why are multiples low? Because institutions have shunned fossil fuel companies too long and Yellen and Granholm have also told development banks to tighten lending conditions to oil companies. 

Divestment examples:

Yellen and fossil fuel lending:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/yellen-targets-curbs-on-development-bank-support-for-fossil-fuel#xj4y7vzkg


Besides that, analysts will say ‚Äúshareholders want buybacks and dividends over growth.‚Äù It‚Äôs becoming a tired phrase. Who are shareholders here? Greedy people like me who want gains and don‚Äôt want to have them produce more without me making any more money, and etf and fund managers like blackrock and vanguard who only are custodians of the shares but get all the voting power. Guess what? Not only are they greedy too, but they also want to choke oil. Consequently, the sector globally is in liquidation. According to Rick Rule (who I trust a lot), the oil industry is $1b/day underinvested in sustaining current output. Furthermore, if, for example, Brent is at $110 and oil stocks price in $60, am I going to want to risk oversupply? No! Because I would be terrified about what share price would do if it priced in $60 at $110 and then the price actually dropped down to $60. What would it price in then? $20 at $60? $10? Negative?

OPEC also cannot ramp up production anytime soon. And why would they? 

https://time.com/6219783/opec-large-production-cut/

They want $90+ oil

https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-tells-biden-that-uea-saudi-can-barely-raise-oil-output-2022-06-27/

They can‚Äôt. Only Russia could have, but they needed western OFS, which all left the country, so their production will actually fall. 

We must rely on western oil companies.

Conclusion: Oil prices will remain heightened and volatile and spikes will persist until oil stocks go up. The cure to high prices is no longer high prices. It‚Äôs high oil stock prices. They are stupid cheap, and until they trade at reasonable multiples, shareholders and etf managers like blackrock and vanguard will not let them do anything but dividends and buybacks.  And that is great for CEOs and boards. No need to make hard choices. No need to take risks. Just say those two magic words.

additional note # 1: Regarding XOM being at ATH: No cause of concern yet. there are small caps cash flowing their market cap out there. I would buy those. But as for XOM, XOM/SPX chart shows we have a long way to go till overvaluation https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=XOM%2FSPX

ATH tells you one thing. inflation adjusted high says another. reinclusion into SPX will tell you another (people will frontrun that). Ratio chart is the most useful imo. For XOM/SPX and also XOP/oil ratio. I learned to look at those from a guy on youtube who runs a neat channel called ‚Äúfinding value finance‚Äù. great follow for all things commodities

Additional note #2: Before I hear wsb scream about ‚Äúrecession so oil bad‚Äù, I would like to point out that hedge funds are more likely to short oil stocks bc of this conventional wisdom and also that while the fed may be powerful, congress can pump out stimmies for energy just as powerfully AND win when unfunded liabilities force the fed to lower rates bc of plummeting tax receipts. That is what can happen instead of bankruptcy when governments screw up. Also OPEC will fight the fed and win.

tl;dr
Shareholders will only allow significant new production when stocks go up. Till then, buybacks and dividends.
If they are not making gains somehow, what the hell are they holding high torque cyclical stocks for? So stop throwing money into the bottomless hole that is tech. XOM just hit ATH. you will never make as much money as the guy you heard about it from, but there is room to run. If you are afraid of being late, late cycle OFS (esp offshore drillers) hasn‚Äôt outperformed yet. Also some companies in Latin America are cashflowing their market cap",The cure for high oil prices is high oil stocks. XOM hit ATH this week. Time to buy late(r) movers.

After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though.

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn‚Äôt happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn‚Äôt rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really ‚Äúcheap‚Äù opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low‚Ä¶ this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel‚Ä¶ lol yes I know right?

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that ‚Äúmid‚Äù point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow.

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn‚Äôt seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out‚Ä¶ which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that ‚Äúoh wow yeah lets sell‚Äù reason again and I don‚Äôt forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that‚Äôs where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn‚Äôt ready to slow or pause‚Ä¶ he said inflation aint fixed‚Ä¶ so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us‚Ä¶ how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

182,1667322045,yje80q,1,"Some of Meta‚Äôs biggest shareholders have lined up to vent their anger at the social media company‚Äôs management after it stunned Wall Street with plans to ramp up its lossmaking effort to build the metaverse.

Even after a slide that has wiped 74 per cent from Meta‚Äôs stock price in little over a year, however, investors and boardroom experts said there was little outsiders could do to prevent chief executive Mark Zuckerberg using his majority control to plough ahead with a bet that has lost the confidence of Wall Street.

Meta‚Äôs shares tumbled 25 per cent on Thursday after the company revealed that losses from Reality Labs, its division that is building the metaverse, would grow ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù in 2023, after reaching $9.4bn in the first nine months of this year. Investors were also startled by another jump in capital spending that Meta said would consume as much as $39bn next year, more than double the level of 2021.

‚ÄúIf any other company had done this you‚Äôd have activist investors writing letters, proposing alternative slates of directors, demanding change,‚Äù said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer for US growth at AllianceBernstein, a Meta shareholder. ‚ÄúI think Mark heard crystal clear what investors wanted. He‚Äôs made his decision.‚Äù

The anger has spilled over into meetings with management, some of which Zuckerberg has attended personally since Meta shocked Wall Street with its spending plans late on Wednesday.

‚ÄúIt does seem like there‚Äôs a sense of frustration‚Äù among investors over the company‚Äôs ballooning costs, said one person familiar with the discussions.

Referring to the series of informal follow-up calls with investors after the company announced earnings late on Wednesday, Tierney said: ‚ÄúWhen people had callbacks with the company they got more disgusted, not less disgusted.‚Äù

‚ÄúZuckerberg was tone-deaf to the investment community, doubling down on everything,‚Äù said David Older, head of equities at ‚Ç¨33.2bn asset manager Carmignac, which has holdings in Amazon, Microsoft and Google but not Meta. ‚ÄúThe timeline for the metaverse is very stretched.

186,1667241257,yikig8,1,"Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.  


For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

https://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in. 

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow AM. 

I am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb. Good bye.","Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM.

Launched in 2016, IIP is the first publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange to provide real estate capital to the regulated cannabis industry. The company's sale-leaseback program includes cultivation, processing and retail properties with carefully chosen tenants that are licensed operators under long-term, triple-net leases.

Over the last five years, IIP's stock has outperformed some of the most popular stocks in the world, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). That's not all, the company has been paying consecutive quarterly dividends to its common stockholders since the second quarter of 2017.

The San Diego, California-headquartered marijuana REIT is focused on well-capitalized and state-licensed cannabis businesses across all product types, targeting deals in the amounts of $5 million to $30+ million. Its standard lease terms last from 10 to 20 years, with initial base rents of 10% to 16% on total investment.

Among the company's lessees are some of the biggest multi-state operators like Curaleaf Holdings

(OTCQX: CURLF), Trulieve Cannabis (OTCQX: TCNNF), PharmaCann, Cresco Labs (OTCQX: CRLBF), Columbia Care (OTCQX: CCHWF), Green Thumb Industries (OTCQX: GTBIF), Goodness Growth Holdings (OTCQX: GDNSF), 4Front Ventures (OTCQX: FFNTF), Holistic Industries, Ayr Wellness (OTCQX: AYRWF), Parallel, and Ascend Wellness Holdings (OTCQX: AAWH).

As of September 1, 2022, IIP owns 111 properties comprising an aggregate of around 8.7 million rentable square feet (including approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet under development or redevelopment) in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

In its latest earnings report, the company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.9 million for the second quarter of 2022, or $1.42 per diluted share, and AFFO of approximately $60.1 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. It also paid a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per common share on July 15, 2022, to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2022, representing a 25% increase over the prior year's second quarter 2021 dividend, equal to an annualized dividend of $7.00 per share.

Here's how returns break down from October 2017 to the present:

Netflix is up from $200.01 a share to $295.72 for a return of 47.85%;

# Scalping Review

SPY opened at that 380 range and held (important level to hold as noted in last post). It started its first leg. It came back down to 380.96 at around 8:12 UTC-6 and tested 20 MA and AVWAP. It bounced and continued upward, completing another leg and half or so. For the next hour and half, SPY traded in a large flat top triangle - getting three bounces off the 385.04 line on the scalping chart. SPY broke out of the triangle at 10:15 UTC-6 and backtested twice. The 388.96 full measured move was hit EOD. SPY continued it‚Äôs uptrend and traded in a rectangle from 11:10 UTC-6 to 12:32 UTC-6. It broke out and hit 388.96 full measured move EOD. We closed right around 389.34 line on scalping chart.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks ended a volatile week with a sizable gain as Apple's earnings report boosted technology shares and a smattering of economic data suggested the Federal Reserve is making some progress in its battle against inflation.

  
The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 both posted their longest weekly gains since August. Gains in major technology companies such as Microsoft and Google Parent Alphabet aided both indexes in reversing a two-day decline.

  
Treasuries fell on Friday, snapping a three-day rally, as hopes of a Fed pivot faded. The dollar rose for the second day in a row.

  
This week, stocks, bonds, and the dollar swung wildly as investors tried to make sense of conflicting earnings reports and economic data.

  
Quarterly reports from megacap tech names underscored the impact of the Fed‚Äôs tightening regime, and consequently the surging dollar.

  
Meanwhile, a core measure of US inflation increased in September, strengthening the Fed's case for another jumbo rate hike next week. However, a contraction in manufacturing and services, as well as lower-than-expected US home sales, indicated that the Fed's actions were already having an impact on the economy. The release of gross domestic product data on Thursday temporarily allayed fears of a recession.

  
Economists continue to expect the Fed to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point next week, for the fourth time in a row. Rates are expected to rise another half point in December, followed by quarter point increases in the next two meetings.

As a head up to all interested, they are on November 3 revealing their plans for India. As far as we know Gogoro is making co-operation with Indian company Hero Motocorp which is one of the largest two-wheeler manufacturers in the world and also with Foxconn which is world's largest technology manufacturer and service provider (which has indicated that they would like to build the battery swapping network in India preferably with Gogoro). The potential would be enormous in case they success with go to market.

[https://www.bikedekho.com/news/breaking-gogoro-to-reveal-plans-for-india-on-november-3-15259](https://www.bikedekho.com/news/breaking-gogoro-to-reveal-plans-for-india-on-november-3-15259)

Let's talk about the elephant in the room first. Taiwan and China relations are not the best at the moment. This is generating a substantion geopolitical risk for Gogoro. The ones who suspect that China will invade Taiwan anytime soon should stop reading at this point and skip to the next thread. However, the ones who think that China is far too busy with other topics at the moment than trying to invade Taiwan and risking their already poor economical performance with sanctions are free to check this opportunity out.

As a typical SPAC company Gogoro's journey in Nasdaq has been a bumpy ride down (with very low volume). In addition to overall SPAC sentiment, geopolitical risks, covid restrictions and challenges in first overseas expansion efforts in China the financial performance is relatively good. The company has a solid revenue stream, finance muscles for expansion and increasing userbase (sticky users who pay monthly subscriptions). There is room to grow in Taiwan (population 25 million) but main opportunity lies in countries like India, Indonesia and other south east asian countires with high scooter usage.

Gogoro's product is second to none in the market. In industry reviews Gogoro is in top position in battery swapping for two wheelers. I've been checking out multiple competitor products and my honest subjective opinion is that Gogoro simply seems to be the best. Marketing material etc. is top notch like Apple or Tesla for example. Other competitor's products looks like some garage engineering start ups :) As a clarification the main idea for Gogoro is to build battery swapping network so that other manufacturers could use the Powered By Gogoro Network (a bit like Android). They already have 10+ manufactures onboard.

Maybe the most serious competitor is Gachaco (I always need to Google the name as I can't remember it). It's based on Honda's technology and looks pretty decent. There are also plenty of companies planning to build a scooter based on that product. However, just by checking the product and marketing material I'm not fully convinced. Compared to Gogoro there are additional steps when switching the batteries and the overall marketing material isn't so good and appealing to public (my personal opinion). They have launced small pilots in Japan and India but there obviously seems to be a very long road ahead of them to improve their product and there surely is lot to catch up with Gogoro which has around 10 years experience of finetuning the product and services (AI etc.). Also even if the Gachaco would grow their market share then there still is a room for couple of players. It is also nice to know that scooters can have multiple battery variations as for example Yamaha has scooters in Taiwan which are based on Gogoro technology.

CEO Horace Luke who has background in innovating Xbox and succesfully launcing HMD phones in the past is very capable guy. He has a passion to sustainability and no suprise he was the one who initiated battery swapping for two wheelers in the first place by inventing the products. Btw, his name is in many of the patents so really this guy knows what he is doing and is really hands in the sand guy with can do attitude.

No doubt Gogoro is a risky bet but the potential is also enormous. In a long run two wheeler's sustainability topic in big cities has to be addressed in a one way or another and battery swapping sounds much more practical than hundreds of millions of individual users charging with wires. Gogoro might or might not be the rainmaker in the industry in the next decade but it has a good chance. Successful India expansion would surely ensure a payday for all $GGR investors (especially for the ones who have loaded up shares with $3 prices). For the ones who prefer less risk then it might be good idea to follow up the financial performance for some time as you can always jump on board a bit later.

I own plenty of Gogoro shares and I'm willing to take the risk at this point. However, I'm not a financial advisor so make your own dd :)",Gogoro $GGR is revealing its plans for India on Nov 3,1.0,2022-10-27 11:32:10

As the world's largest digital advertising company in terms of market share, Google‚Äôs revenue and profits both fell short of expectations, underscoring how the macroeconomic slowdown has hit demand for digital advertising industry.

Google's shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading, dragging down shares of other tech giants with related advertising businesses. Meta, Amazon and Pinterest all fell more than 4%.

Broken down by business, revenue and profit from Google's services business -- its core advertising and search, Android and Chrome browsers, hardware, Google Maps, Google Pay, the Play app store and YouTube video platform -- were weaker than expected

Other Bets, the former tech innovation division that includes self-driving startup Waymo, AI DeepMind, smart healthcare Verily and others, also missed revenue estimates and lost more than expected, with only the cloud business beating both revenue and loss estimates in the third quarter.

Specifically, revenue from search and other related businesses was $39.54 billion, compared with $37.926 billion a year ago, below analysts' expectations of $40.87 billion. YouTube posted $7.071 billion in AD sales, below expectations of $7.47 billion and even lower than $7.205 billion in the same period last year.

Alphabet

shares dropped about 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for the third quarter and said it would significantly decrease headcount growth.

    Earnings per share (EPS): $1.06 vs. $1.25 expected, according to Refinitiv estimates.
    Revenue: $69.09 billion vs. $70.58 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates.
    YouTube advertising revenue: $7.07 billion vs $7.42 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.
    Google Cloud revenue: $6.9 billion vs $6.69 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates
    Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $11.83 vs $12.38 expected, according to StreetAccount estimates

Revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41% a year earlier as the company contends with a continued downdraft in online ad spending. Other than one period early in the pandemic, it‚Äôs the weakest period for growth since 2013.

YouTube ad revenue slid about 2% to $7.07 billion from $7.21 billion a year ago. Analysts were expecting an increase of about 3%. Alphabet reported overall advertising revenue of $54.48 billion during the quarter, up slightly from the prior year.

Philipp Schindler, chief business officer for Google, said the company saw a pullback in spend on search ads from certain areas such as insurance, loans, mortgage and cryptocurrencies.

The report marks an ominous start to Big Tech earnings week for investors focused on the digital ad market. Last week, Snap issued disappointing results and said it was unable to provide a forecast given the volatility in spending and concerns about the economy. Snap plummeted 28% on Friday following the numbers. Meta
is scheduled to report results on Wednesday, and analysts are expecting a second straight quarter of declining revenue.

Alphabet‚Äôs stock fell below $97 after hours. Its lowest close for the year was $95.65 on Sept. 30. Prior to the after-hours drop, Alphabet shares are down 28% over the past year, slightly underperforming the Nasdaq.

Meta shares fell 4% in extended trading on Tuesday after rallying 6% during the day.

Alphabet‚Äôs top executives referenced the challenges the company faces at the top of Tuesday‚Äôs earnings release. CEO Sundar Pichai said in the statement that the company is ‚Äúsharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities,‚Äù while Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.‚Äù

During the quarter, Google Cloud brought in $6.9 billion ‚Äî more than analysts expected. That‚Äôs a notable increase from $5 billion the year prior. Losses in Google Cloud widened to $699 million from $644 million the year prior.

Pichai enacted some cost-cutting measures across the company, citing economic challenges, including a potential recession, soaring inflation, rising interest rates and tempered ad spending. In September, Pichai said he wanted to make the company 20% more efficient, which could include slashing jobs and product cuts.

Google also canceled the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and cut funding to its Area 120 in-house incubator. And last month, Google said it would be shuttering its digital gaming service Stadia.

The company said it has a total full-time worker headcount of 186,779 ‚Äî up from 150,028 last year. Pichai said on Tuesday‚Äôs call that the fourth-quarter headcount additions will be ‚Äúsignificantly lower‚Äù than the third quarter as the company becomes ‚Äúfocused on moderating operating expense growth.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023,‚Äù Pichai said, reiterating comments from the second-quarter call. ‚ÄúTalent is the most precious resource,‚Äù he said.

Porat said that in the fourth quarter, ‚Äúheadcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3.‚Äù",Alphabet misses on earnings as YouTube shrinks; company will cut headcount growth by half in Q4,1.0,2022-10-26 08:14:06

The issue we have now is that MSFT and Google earnings apparently did not go very well and that is causing a pretty significant red after hours. As I am writing this SPY is down about -0.9%. 

We were able today to push pretty green and we broke through the last resistance of the bear channel level from the August sell off. That is pretty bullish. With this earnings miss we could look for a healthy pull back to reconfirm support after a pretty large 3 day green move up. Or this could end up being the next peak of the bear market rally and we start our descent downward to the 350s/ 360s. For me until we break that red bull channel support I will remain bullish. I will also be watching closely for what we do at that 378.2 support level. Tomorrow could actually have a really impressive red day and still maintain the red bull channel. 

Key support- 382.3 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 378.1 -&gt; 374.4

I dare say I was impressed with tesla today! It perfectly hit my first target of 223 (unfortunately I closed my calls way too early). However, today we saw tesla once again hold support and actually had one of the most bullish days I have seen in a very long time. However, in the end it fell just short of 222.5 resistance. We have a nice diamond pattern formed here where you can see Tesla rejected on its upside move today. Tesla still could see a retracement but it is showing some signs of bullishness after it established 206 as support. 

Tomorrow or later this week I will need to see Tesla break through that blue bear channel in order to believe in a bigger move up to 230s. If we continue to see the trend of sell off followed by a rogue green day that only brings further downside and we close back under 205 at any point I will be looking at puts. 

Key support- 215.1 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.7

Key resistance- 22.4 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234.1

Terrible timing‚Ä¶ but the VIX finally sold off. We finally broke the bull channel and we even retested that key 28.4 level, however, we ended up bouncing pretty hard off of it. With these earnings coming in and this hugely red after hours it will be interesting to see what the VIX does tomorrow. 

10% challenge- 

Overall a great day that was heavily support by some level to level plays I made.

Granted especially Tesla which went on to almost triple the profits from where I closed them I had some pretty stout wins this morning on my level to level wins. With earnings coming out tonight and being gone at the EOD I decided it was best to sit cash gang overnight. I will be looking to see where thing settle tomorrow by EOD and will look for some level to level plays there.

I was able to play a few level to level plays intraday today for some smaller profits. I got greedy on them but didn‚Äôt let them go red. I suspect tomorrow to be able to have a few of these level to level plays to play again. SPY lately really has been respecting key pivot support/ resistance levels.

216,1666644542,ycm8og,1,"Amazon has frozen hiring in parts of its lucrative web services division ‚Äî an apparent escalation of the company‚Äôs cost-cutting efforts, The Post has learned.

Amazon Web Services ‚Äî the highly profitable division that brought in more than $62 billion in revenue in 2021 ‚Äî has started telling some job candidates that roles they were seeking have been frozen, according to prospective candidates.

On Oct. 4, the New York Times reported that Amazon would stop hiring new corporate employees in its retail and logistics operations ‚Äî but added that AWS was not affected by the freeze.

Some analysts interpreted AWS‚Äô reported exemption as evidence of the division‚Äôs importance within Amazon, where it has been responsible for generating an increasingly large share of the company‚Äôs profits in recent years. Current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy founded and led AWS before he replaced Jeff Bezos as chief executive in 2021 ‚Äî further evidence of the division‚Äôs significance.

But an AWS spokesperson confirmed that parts of the division have stopped hiring new employees.

‚ÄúIn some areas of AWS we have met our hiring needs, and in others we have thousands of job openings,‚Äù the spokesperson told The Post.

The spokesperson did not provide specifics on which areas of AWS have frozen hiring or how many roles were affected.

‚ÄúAcross Amazon, our many different businesses are at various stages of evolution, and we expect to keep adjusting our hiring strategies in each of these businesses at various junctures,‚Äù the spokesperson said. 

While Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce business receives far more attention from consumers, AWS sells so-called cloud computing services that are crucial to the modern internet.

Companies like Netflix and Snapchat are large AWS customers, while rivals like Google and Microsoft have built their own cloud computing services to compete with Amazon. 

Amazon is still planning to  hire roughly 150,000 seasonal workers to deal with this year‚Äôs holiday shipping rush.

Its Monday cocksuckers.. And lady cocksuckers. And boy do I have a spicy one for you today...   Lasers BITCH!
 
April 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB and all the hype of a potential MSFT buyout, we all know how that went, but fuck you that's not the point. Fast forward 18 months and it‚Äôs clear that the price action in April 2021 was just an amuse bouch√©e for what will happen next.

Developments since April 2021 include:
Mavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It‚Äôs getting worse by the week as daily we are seeing trading largely Algo driven as with a lot of the market, liquidity is drying up and shorts are passing blocks between themselves to drive the price down. Some wrinkle brains with actual knowledge of how the market works have counts in the range of 100million shares short total on MVIS, a big difference from the 24% currently reported. Average short volume for the past 30 days is a whopping 70.36% with off exchange volume for the past 30 days touching 34.08%. Given many stocks are highly shorted right now I don't want to hear any slabbering, I know this shit man, but with a product as delicious as MAVIN Dr just being trademarked, and the fact they provided the light engine which made the Hololens 2 possible, and lets face it, if MSFT are using MVIS for the Hololens 2 they sure as hell are using it for the IVAS which secured MSFT that ball tingling $22bili contract with the US military. This is a ticking time bomb ready to fuck any short brave enough to touch it. Hiya Kenny.
 
MVIS have a cash runway for 2 years. They have negligible debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. Which given the state of the world right now is a golden arrow in their quiver, many of these competitors aren't likely to make it to production without seriously diluting their shareholders... I'm looking at you Omer(INVZ CEO for those unaware) who on the 29th of September announced Mixed shelf registration for up to $200million... CEO claims they don't need it but have done so for ""good business practices"".... Check his twitter comments stating such. I call bullshit, enough said.

MVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. 
MVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an ‚ÄúOEM friendly‚Äù white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor. Which the company has filed trademark registration for on 10/11/2022 https://uspto.report/TM/97628161 notice the smaller form factor compared to the original postings on linkedIn 
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/microvision_autosens-automotivelidar-activity-6975685318729490432-Hy3B?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop

Now the company has stated the form factor will get smaller when ASIC is completed... Is this the final smaller form or will we see another size decrease... We can only speculate for now..

Mavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. This has been tested and demonstrated to Some OEM (it hasn't been declared who) in Germany where the company has Offices set up as of last year... Someone wants MVIS in Germany...

Mavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. 

Mavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.

Mavin is available to OEMs via the NVDA platform.
MVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&amp;A. Feeling like Pac-Man munching up these dots.. Nom, Nom, Nom. 

MVIS currently has 3 vacancies for ASIC design engineers https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/
To which the CEO Sumit Sharma stated last year that it is not cost effective to design an ASIC unless they have secured orders for 1.2-1.5 million units... What does that tell you???

Sumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! Listen. Some clampets out there are stating that such a certification is capable of being self-certed.. to which I respond... Why the delay then bitch??? Because just like everything in this shitshow of a world since Covid, THERE ARE DELAYS.

MVIS said in the Jan 2022 investor slides that they would be ready for partnerships this year. Now that Class 1 certification has been achieved, MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! To which Sample sales have already started and are being shipped off to the big knobs with fat ass check books as we speak...

Single Unit - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/3.jpg
5 Unit case - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/4.jpg
Talk about classy..

MVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July‚Äôs earnings call. Now they have the class 1 certification, those orders have been shipped. They quoted one OEM as saying ‚ÄúMavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen‚Äù. Sumit‚Äôs character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. Now, when I say Sumit is a humble man I certainly believe that to be the case, he is an engineer, so he gets rightfully excited when talking about the product and what the company has achieved with such, and in my opinion has no need to be a boisterous character like we see in some of the competitors, *cough* Austin Russell *cough* which tells me a lot about the company and the product they are offering...
 
The MVIS executive bonus scheme was launched this summer and it rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36. Todays opening price was $3.49. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! The tiered executive bonus scheme is organised as such that management doesn't get awarded shares unless the share price reaches the thresholds and stays there for 20 days. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. This is the real deal, and will make you enough money to finally move your way up from sleeping at the bottom of your wife and her many boyfriends bed.   

Their investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market. 

They have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  

In January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That‚Äôs a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple deals are expected to be signed over the next 9-10 months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. 

In addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which as previously mentioned only exists because of MVIS tech! 

https://youtu.be/OmiQvjQuFqQ

Done so by a very fine Redditor who took it upon himself after countless hours or research following patents etc to prove once and for all that MVIS are the dogs balls and have the tech so well patented and perfected that the biggest, baddest tech companies in the world cannot make this tech as good as this for themselves. Hiya Meta and APPL. Now MSFT had MVIS by the balls when this deal was struck as the company could well have been facing bankruptcy if it wasn't for the savage group of investors who put so much into this company, they staved off the relentless shorting and helped bring about the savage short squeeze we seen in April 2021.... This company has made so many people life changing amounts of money... But guess what, they ain't fucking done yet. People still buying shares when its right for them as they know the life changing money they have already made will be made again...   

Many AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. 
Then factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, and no one is selling. We all know what we own. 
It‚Äôs going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price.  There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  it‚Äôs inevitable.

Oh yeah EC is this Thursday.. Not expecting any mind blowing or even significant revenue changes, anyone expecting such will be sorely disappointed, but that is not the point. The business updates and hearing the confidence in managements statements is enough to get you harder than a couple little blue boys and your Mrs standing with a big red dildo to fuck you harder than the market has this year.

Listen, I could post DD for days on this company but you degenerate fucks are probably only going to read the TLDR and tell me to ""short squeeze these nuts"" (Fuck you Automod) buy shares, LEAPs if you must, but do not play into the MMs hand by buying weeklies or I'm going to come fuck you myself.

TLDR; this is in my opinion the most highly researched company on the market, the DD is phenomenal, and the company has the meat to follow. They cannot make a move without retail hot on their tail... And management KNOW THIS... Fuck the shorts, lasers are the future and MVIS knows lasers better than anyone.  PEW PEW

P.s THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY, although, the fact it is so highly shorted is just some extra fuel for when a deal is announced i'm telling you now so you have a chance to get in not far off what has so far been the bottom... What happens between now and a deal being announced is anyone's guess, but this is a damn good place to join the roller-coaster.

Wall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market‚Äôs most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy‚Äôs health.

On the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) ‚Äì which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index ‚Äì will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.

A bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

 

Earnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.

For this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.

Earnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn‚Äôt leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla‚Äôs revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

 

On Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.

Strength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback‚Äôs 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.

That headwind is expected to show up in Amazon‚Äôs results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate‚Äôs revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that ‚Äúforeign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs"" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.

  

For Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted ‚Äúdemand has held up better than expected in recent months.‚Äù

Meta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech‚Äôs 72-hour earnings rollout.

Other notable financial results on tap include the Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), General Electric ([GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE)), General Motors ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)), Ford Motor ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), Comcast ([CMCSA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)), Visa ([V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V)), Mastercard ([MA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA)), and Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM)), among others.

In economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings ‚Äì which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER‚Äôs panel of economists must officially declare a recession.

Economic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

 

According to Pantheon Economics‚Äô Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.

‚ÄúBut the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,‚Äù Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",Yahoo Finance Big Tech earnings and GDP data,1.0,2022-10-24 02:46:56

Economic Data

Tuesday:

The Commerce Department releases its report on August sales of new homes in the U.S. New-home sales fell 12.6% in July compared with June.

The Conference Board publishes its September consumer-confidence index, which measures U.S. attitudes toward jobs and the economy. Consumer confidence improved in August after falling for three consecutive months.

Wednesday

The National Association of Realtors reports the number of home sales based on contract signings in August. Pending home sales declined in July for the second consecutive month as high mortgage rates and elevated home prices diminished demand.

Thursday

The Commerce Department publishes a third estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product‚Äîa broad measure of the goods and services produced in an economy‚Äîafter its second estimate showed that the decline in U.S. economic output during that time was less severe than initially estimated. The second estimate showed that the economy contracted at a 0.6% annual rate in the April-through-June period, a slower pace than the 0.9% decline initially estimated, driven in part by an upward revision of consumer spending.

China‚Äôs National Bureau of Statistics and S&amp;P Global release September surveys of purchasing managers about economic activity in China‚Äôs manufacturing sector. China‚Äôs agency also releases a separate survey measuring the country‚Äôs nonmanufacturing sector.

Friday

The European Union‚Äôs statistics agency releases September inflation figures for the 19-nation eurozone. The bloc‚Äôs consumer prices were 9.1% higher in August than the same month a year earlier, the fastest pace since records began in early 1997.

The University of Michigan publishes its final reading of consumer sentiment for September. Its initial estimate earlier in the month showed it had ticked up from August‚Äôs final reading.

# TL;DR

I'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:  

1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.
2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**  
3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble. 
4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone. 
5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.

You see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.

The remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.

I am confused between what's the difference between the stock BP and, cash and sweep. So basically what happened was that I got assigned for my short CALL option and currently have -100 shares holding for that stock.

My account now has +ve cash and sweep, while -ve stock BP. Assuming that I sold off my long CALL option which makes my stock BP +ve, does that mean I will be able to buy back the 100 shares (cash and sweep would be above the required cost for 100 shares of that stock)?

229,1666228586,y8k6uk,1,"Need to see what the non-adjusted eps was, but based on what I can read so far, the following is true:

Tesla Q3 '22 EPS - $1.05

Tesla Q3 '21 EPS - $.48

Tesla TTM eps $3.33. At the current SP of $208 (after hours), that puts PE ratio at 62. Down almost 20 points from it's current PE due to earnings growth. 

Meta - Between Q3 '21 and Q2 '22, EPS have declined by 23%, with an even bigger decline YOY once their Q3 earnings come out.

Amazon - Q3 '21 eps were $0.31 and Q2 '22 eps were negative (-0.20). Maybe they'll get some support from Rivian SP going up around 30% between beginning Q3 and end of Q3, but their operating margins are still lousy in this inflationary environment. They're up against a tough comparison for Q3 '21 so their TTM EPS will likely further decrease, pushing up their PE ratio and putting pressure on share price.

Google - EPS have decreased from $1.40 in Q3 '21 to $1.20 for Q2 '22. We'll have to see what Q3 brings, but likely it'll be less than the $1.4 eps they made in Q3 '21.

Even apple is seeing eps decline. 

My only point is that we've been in an earnings recession within big tech (and tech in general) for the past several quarters. Tesla has been one of the few outliers. Their eps growth has been explosive, where everyone else has been declining.

Astrology is the ancient knowledge of cosmic truth and its impact on the order of human and natural affairs, through duly repeated observation of astrological cycles and their relationship with a condensed mystical narrative according to how the stars are grouped together.

This is likely to sound stupid to the suits on Wall Street. However, with proper study they could easily be the greatest beneficiaries of this knowledge. Can the stars meddle in business affairs? Yes, they can. And they have, throughout history.

For example, if we take a look at Forbes‚Äô top companies on the stock market, we find that the gold medal for business founders among the Top 500 corresponds to Aries, the sign linked to beginnings (Visa, Wal-Mart, JP Morgan, Google, among others).

As far as personalities go, Elon Musk was born under the sign of Cancer, as was Nikola Tesla. The Red Bull brand was created by a Taurus (the bull). Astrological signs are traditionally grouped according to the elements, and curiously, Coca-Cola was created by a man born under the element of water (same as Budweiser); Boeing, lord of the skies, was born under an air sign, as was Vanderbilt (transportation and trade magnate, areas associated with air element); Andrew Carnegie, steel foundry magnate, under the sign of fire, and C. L. Best (Caterpillar Tractor Company) under a sign of earth.

And if, as the saying goes, ‚Äúastrology is the religion of women,‚Äù those born between cardinal signs seem to triumph with greater frequency among female. The seven richest women in the world, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, Alice Walton, MacKenzie Scott, Julia Koch, Miriam Adelson, Jacqueline Mars, and Yang Huiyan, were born under these signs: Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. Seven of the eight most powerful women as of 2020 according to Forbes were also born under these cardinal signs: Merkel, Lagarde, Harris, von der Leyen, Barra, Pelosi.

But the stars not only imbue our births with a cosmic baptism of energy and determine a large part of our destinies, even more importantly, they affect daily actions and behaviors for individuals as well as companies and markets.

It happens that Wall Street, for example, usually drops in October. There is a very high over-representation of Wall Street drops occurring in Libra or Scorpio, for which there is no ‚Äúrational‚Äù explanation. There is, however, an astrological explanation: in October is when the fall begins (Libra/auntum) begins and the destruction of Scorpio (the poisonous scorpion) is consummated. We can observe as well that on numerous occasions stocks rise with the new moon and fall with the full moon (a phenomenon studied in depth by Ilia Dichev and Troy Janes, University of Michigan).

But while the biggest crashes occur during autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, this season also witnesses the greatest upward rallies. According to statistics from Bloomberg, in the last ten years five out of ten best days in the year for investing occurred in autumn, under Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius). The other five days were split between Aries (3) and Pisces (2), with a striking absence of the more stable earth signs.

How can the same astrological momentum create the best and worst financial results? Astrology is not a linear science, certainly not an exact science, but it nevertheless offers truth. The answer to this question lies within dialectics and the ‚Äúattraction of opposites.‚Äù

The Zodiac sign most related to money, Taurus, is also behind the greatest proponents of Communism around the world, such as Lenin, Marx, and Guevara. ‚ÄúTogether, we form a necessary paradox; not a senseless contradiction.‚Äù (C. Jami)

This understanding can also be applied to other speculative areas, such as cryptocurrency (usually trending upward in the new moon and falling under the full moon), commodities, foreign exchange, and even sports betting. Yes, sport betting: Seven out of eight Grand Slam titles in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs tennis this last season were won by Geminis (Nadal, Djokovic, Rybakina, and Swiatek, for example).

Each and every area of speculative investment can benefit immensely from the correct use of astrological science, applying it from a scientific, practical, and statistical methodology. In summary, a kind of Big Data Astrology, where huge statistical samples serve to understand astro-human relationships.

There are already many established patterns and investors that would benefit; the challenge is to implement a more developed system combining a large sampling of stock market variations and using algorithms to analyze the irregularities based on astrological premises, thus creating astrological guidelines accurate enough to predict future stock market movements.

The key is combining the present (Big Data) and the past (astrological wisdom), keeping in mind that the origins of computer science are closely linked to astronomy, making computers incredibly powerful in this regard and incomparably superior to our ancestors‚Äô methods of calculation.

If you compare a given company‚Äôs stock price over thousands of days with the position of one specific planet or the moon, you would likely find a patter to the relationship between the moon‚Äôs position in the heavens and the company‚Äôs stock. The more marked the patter, the greater the likelihood of its recurrence.

I‚Äôd like to point out that these conclusions must be taken with the awareness that no matter how accurate, it is not an exact science, and no matter how much Big Data is used mankind‚Äôs free will eludes any galactic interference. This article presents a mere hypothesis, and hopes to open the door to the development of what could be a type of modern alchemy, easy to achieve with the proper budget and resources, combining aspects of astrology and Big Data to create software capable of predicting not only movements in the stock market, but also in any type of speculative assets.

From abstract bases it will be possible through Big Data to reach perfectly quantifiable conclusions and patterns that would allow investors to shed light on markets‚Äô futures. We will be achieving with computers and equations what our ancestors did thousands of years ago: searching the heavens for clues about the future and chasing its brightness through the darkness of the night.",Wall Street Astrology (Article),1.0,2022-10-15 01:25:27
238,1665791576,y492p3,1,"According to ""The Ponzi Factor,"" [https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/](https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/), companies like Google, Tesla and Berkshire-Hathaway are ponzi schemes. Why? Because none of them  provide dividends to their shareholders and ""therefore,"" can only supply value to their investors by receiving an influx of investments from new investors, which is the definition of a ponzi scheme (see [https://www.sec.gov/files/ia\_virtualcurrencies.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_virtualcurrencies.pdf) and [https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml)). 

This (if the reasoning is to be believed) means that Berkshire-Hathaway has been running a ponzi scheme for the past 183 years. But companies like Google and Tesla do provide value to their investors because they provide value to their customers: they actually do something useful, unlike, say, Bernie Madoff. Likewise, Warren Buffett provides value to his customers by investing in companies which provide great value to their customers. So The Ponzi Factor's claim just don't make sense.

Key Excerpt:

AMONG THE JOURNAL‚ÄôS FINDINGS:   

* While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon. com Inc. 
* More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.
* More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.
* At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies. 
* About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.  
* When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency‚Äôs work.",WSJ: Government Officials Invest in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,1.0,2022-10-11 15:15:18

So yea this isn‚Äôt financial advice and the stock market is way more irrational than us cucks are solvent. 

With that being said‚Ä¶I work for a large national bank and originate distressed debt credit facilities. I‚Äôve been in banking since the Great Recession and I‚Äôve never seen anything like this. This isn‚Äôt a scenario where one asset class (RE) got out of whack and markets dipped 48% while a few Wall Street firms folded and people realized packaging trash with A paper was a bad idea. Deals starting to hit my desk are getting crushed from every direction. 

Usually when I see a shitty company I can usually laugh at the management team and point to exactly why their wives are divorcing them. Not anymore boys. I‚Äôm seeing demand softness across sectors. This reduced demand is resulting in price reduction (see lumber and steel). Seems good right? Wrong. Companies loaded up on expensive inventory because daddy told them to be worried about the supply chain. So now they are relieving inventory and taking huge GAAP losses. In short I‚Äôm seeing companies losing revenue and gross margin across the board. 

But wait‚Ä¶.there‚Äôs more! Interest rates are up. Now people are realizing that I in EBITDA that everyone adds back to cash flow is a cash expense that‚Äôs actually paid. Weird right? Oh and Google the word inflation. Every working in America is leaving the grocery store and gas station like they just got kicked in the nuts. So what do they do?? They ask their employer for more money. In short SG&amp;Admin expense is up across sectors. 

Long discussion short, put on your pampers so your wife doesn‚Äôt have to wash out skid marks when you start yourself. As an economy we‚Äôll be fine, but we are going to see record bankruptcy filings next year (my hunch). There‚Äôs no solution for reduced revenue and margin combined with raping climbing SG&amp;Admin unless Uncle Sam gives everyone more tendies. Luckily we can just export our way out of this. JK! Companies who export are especially hosed.

Below is my rationale behind these companies and my decision to purchase their stocks exclusively and heavily these next 15 months, please let me know your thoughts!

-Diversification from USD. These companies are renown worldwide and bring in 65% of their revenue, give or take, from other currencies - a possible windfall in the future.

-Google has 125 billion dollars in cash. This is about 10% of their market capitalization &amp; they‚Äôre planning on conducting substantial share buybacks now and next year, and possibly buying Pinterest.

-If you type in ‚Äòhow sheryl sandberg changed the digital advertising business‚Äô on google images you will see a graph that shows the global ad spend by mediums and companies, it is astonishing. Meta and Google are also known to be extremely profitable companies.

-Looking at 2021 free cash flow of Meta - 39.3b, and their market cap presently - 372.5b, they produce approximately 10.6% of their market cap in free cash flow. Say in 5-10 years, buying the shares at this valuation, and if the metaverse is a complete dud and they abandon associated capital expenditures, I reckon they will be able to afford a 15% dividend from today‚Äôs value.

-The digital advertising market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 17.6% from 2021-2026.

-Their valuations are extremely appealing.

-They are not associated with China, so potential future conflicts will be less impactful.

I just joined WallStreetBets. I don't condone the rude approach sometimes some people take in the WSB community. But I strongly support the vision behind this community of empowering individual investors. 

This is my first post!

On Friday Sept 30th, AbbVie (an 250 Billion market cap company) stock dropped about 5.5% after a false reporting by CNBC in their ""Clubs Daily Meeting"" hosted by Cramer. Here is more on this mistake from CNBC itself: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/were-upgrading-our-rating-on-abbvie-amid-a-false-report-on-the-biopharmas-guidance.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/were-upgrading-our-rating-on-abbvie-amid-a-false-report-on-the-biopharmas-guidance.html)

This drop in AbbVie's market cap roughly equals to 12 Billion plus loss. Compared to #GME total market cap of 7.65 Billion (on Google at the time of writing this post). 12 Billion is more valuable. Still, nobody in CNBC, other financial media outlets, or anyone else did anything serious about it. They just issued a written article that only their exclusive members can read. While, the loss in AbbVie was suffered by all investors including individual investors who don't subscribe to their hundreds of dollars annual charges worth club membership. AbbVie has a higher than average dividend. And many people who own dividend stocks tend to be more vulnerable investors such as retirees or people of lower income backgrounds. 

Now compare that the #DeepFuckingValue Roaring Kitty situation. How everyone dragged an individual investor into their shameful criticisms. I don't have to say much about that one to remind you all! Do I? 

Disclosures: I have a major part of my personal wealth invested in growth stocks like #SQ. And in the financial universe of tomorrow (that I am not allowed to name for some reason). I may also hold other risk assets like funds or other equities. 

Markets are down. And these fucking institutions have already sold everything. These institutions are just fucking waiting for individual investors to sell now, before they can buy again! I am not selling shit!  For #SQ as an example, Dan Dolev, a prominent financial analyst and a long time #SQ bull who called it like buying JP Morgan in 1871 recently issued a Neural rating and a price target in 50s. 

There is blood on the streets right now. But a lot of that blood is of institutions. I know many individual investors have also suffered losses. But if markets can recover from a housing crash crises and an end of the world situations in the last 15 years, I am positive that they will recover from a Fed interest rate increase sooner or later.

Google will terminate services for Stadia, its troubled cloud gaming service, after it failed to gain traction with players almost three years after its launch.¬†

Stadia was an attempt from Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google to take on the video game console giants with a platform of its own. Unlike traditional consoles, Stadia allowed users to play games on devices such as Android phones and Chromecast apps for TV, by funneling data directly from Google‚Äôs server clusters.¬†

‚ÄúWhile Stadia‚Äôs approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn‚Äôt gained the traction with users that we expected,‚Äù Phil Harrison, Stadia vice president and general manager, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.‚Äù

Players will be able to access their games library and play through Jan. 18. Google will refund Stadia hardware purchases, games and add-on content made through the Google Store, Harrison said.

I‚Äôm a stupid ape with a lot of capital. See post history. 

After losing money for an entire year I think I would like to double down and open a business right before we head into a recession. I have about a million in capital and I see an opportunity to blend Wall Street bets and to drink after your 0DTE put option expires worthless. 

I google searched ‚ÄúWall Street bars‚Äù in the U.S. and I only found one. It‚Äôs located in Ohio and has pretty basic amenities. (Drinks named after tickers, happy hour crashes on random drinks etc) 

My question is, are there people in this sub that would go to a bar that‚Äôs themed to Wall Street Bets? 

I was thinking about creating a leaderboard showing the highest rate of return of profit for their portfolios while creating a monthly drawing to see who has the best rate of return, top 3 would get Amazon gift cards. 

Also my biggest worry is true legal ramifications. This seems like a grey area business if I were to be committed and the last thing I want is to see Gary Gensler showing up with the FED to shut me down.

297,1664045673,xn0x44,1,"Seems Googlers don't understand why travel and entertainment budgets/perks are getting scrutinized and cut.  Markets undergoing a meltdown is irrelevant apparently.  

**Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly grew agitated during a ‚Äúheated‚Äù all-hands meeting in which an employee asked why the search engine was ‚Äúnickel-and-diming‚Äù workers by taking away perks and benefits.**

Pichai, who has ratcheted up the pressure on Googlers to **boost productivity in the midst of a sharp economic downturn**, held court at a meeting in New York this week during which **he was** **grilled by his employees over cuts to travel and entertainment budgets.**

**One worker summoned the nerve to ask Pichai why Google was ‚Äúnickel-and-diming employees‚Äù when the company reported ‚Äúrecord profits and huge cash reserves,‚Äù** according to audio obtained by CNBC.

**The Googler‚Äôs pointed question was met with a positive response by his colleagues**, who **rated it high on the company‚Äôs internal Dory Q&amp;A system**, according to CNBC.

Pichai reportedly paused to gather his thoughts and offer a measured response.

‚ÄúHow do I say it?‚Äù the CEO is reported to have told the disgruntled employee.

**‚ÄúLook, I hope all of you are reading the news, externally,‚Äù Pichai continued. ‚ÄúThe fact that you know, we are being a bit more responsible through one of the toughest macroeconomic conditions underway in the past decade, I think it‚Äôs important that as a company, we pull together to get through moments like this.‚Äù**

Pichai is said to have sounded annoyed, telling his charges: **‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get to choose the macroeconomic conditions always.‚Äù He added that it was important for the company ‚Äúto be smart, to be frugal, to be scrappy, to be more efficient.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI remember when Google was small and scrappy,‚Äù** Pichai said.

**‚ÄúFun didn‚Äôt always ‚Äî we shouldn‚Äôt always equate fun with money. I think you can walk into a hard-working startup and people may be having fun and it shouldn‚Äôt always equate to money.‚Äù** 

**One employee commented on Dory that it was ironic for Pichai to be slashing travel expenses while at the same time flying out to New York from his Bay Area headquarters to meet with them.**

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an interesting choice for Sundar to be in New York‚Ä¶after travel for employees is cut to only the most business critical,‚Äù the employee reportedly wrote on Dory.**

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Sundar has business-critical meetings in New York.‚Äù

Pichai responded: ‚ÄúI think so. I think it qualified.‚Äù The response drew laughter from the audience, according to CNBC.

The CEO, who hinted at layoffs after the company imposed a hiring freeze earlier this summer, also **pushed back against an employee‚Äôs suggestion that Google shifted to a strategy of ""aggressive cost saving"".**

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit concerned that you think what we‚Äôve done is what you would define as aggressive cost saving,‚Äù Pichai said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important we don‚Äôt get disconnected. You need to take a long-term view through conditions like this.‚Äù**

Pichai, who dodged a question about executive pay at Google, said that the firm was **‚Äústill investing in long-term projects like quantum computing.‚Äù**

Pichai earned $6.3 million in salary last year.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that **Google informed some employees that they needed to apply for new jobs within the company if they hoped to remain employed**.

**Those who failed to reapply within 90 days would be let go**, The Journal reported.

Google‚Äôs parent company, Alphabet, reported that its payroll had 174,014 employees as of the end of the second quarter.

In July, Alphabet reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue. The company anticipates that its third-quarter sales growth will fall into the single digits ‚Äî a far cry from the more than 40% figure from a year prior.

Shares of Alphabet fell 1.4% Friday.

The Post has sought comment from the company.

An Alphabet spokesperson told CNBC: **‚ÄúSundar has been speaking to the company consistently over the last few months about ways we can be more focused.‚Äù**

Some facts to keep in mind before I start speculating. 

[Bank of Canada increases policy interest rate by 75 basis points, continues quantitative tightening](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/09/fad-press-release-2022-09-07/)


Here in Canada people are leveraged to tits! With many having variable interest loans, good fucking luck to us all. In today's connected financial paradigm that's a big fucking exposure and that's 1.

[China Surprise Data Could Spell R-e-c-e-s-s-i-o-n](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-16/if-the-china-crisis-deepens-a-global-recession-will-be-much-harder-to-avoid?leadSource=uverify%20wall)

[Btw use this website](https://archive.ph/) to read articles behind paywall. 

China's imports are on a steady decline. Their real estate market that makes up most of people's wealth in China is crumbling. The music stopped. It's only a matter if time before someone starts asking for their money. Oh wait, there were a few bank runs... so I guess we just listen to Comrade Poo until we don't. Lockdowns, tight lending for corrupt real estate moguls are coordinated and calculated acts by the Chinese government. So this is our huge fucking exposure number 2. 


[Euro area annual inflation was 9.1 % in August 2022, up from 8.9 % in July 2022.](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Inflation_in_the_euro_area)


Europoors joined the chat. NGL, GG!. This may come as surprise to some but just google Eurozone GDP growth rate. No, you're not seeing wrong. It's been stagnant for 2 decades. Europe is not really wealthy. They mostly have socialist policies that give them a good quality of life despite making peanut even compared to a tradesperson in a big North American city. 


Now with the energy crisis and recession, there is not much to do but bundle up I guess. Europoors are not as debted as North Americans. Their Household Debt: % of GDP is around 50% as opposed to 75% in the US and 105% in Canada. So their major problem is not people defaulting on mortgages. It's just that people are don't have much to spend to begin with. So I give them a recession times 2. This is your huge fucking financial exposure number 3. 


Let's look at emerging markets... or maybe not. I'll start with this; ""Emerging markets"" are actually nations that produce but don't have a good brand. They are run by a corrupt government that lines their own pockets and keeps their people poor to keep labour cost low. So they always need an inflow of foreign stimuli. Unfortunately, at this time... people be needing cash. So there will be a great outflow of investments from those countries as we get further into our big collapse. So nothing see here. There is nothing positive coming out of this. Trust me bruh.


You can look at Japan, Mexico, India, or fucking Mars. There is not a single positive story here. I'm talking about the war between Russia and Ukraine. I'm assuming that you haven't been living under a rock. 


Now to tie things up... Despite all the BRrrrrr, money isn't going around. Velocity of money (that's how many times money changes hand in a given time-span) is non-existent. There is no longer a diversity in our economy. Most goes to a few corporations and a bank for your loans. Then everything just gets leveraged multiple times and keeps growing on top. Then we have reverse repo at nearly 2 trillion dollars, while printing more money, fed buying debt, and keeping interest rates well under a BS CPI that's intentionally suppressed. 


Ladies and gentleapes, the writing's on the wall. You may think a .75 is great and may think you can ride the edge. At some point you'll realize that you will need every cent you can find to get a roll of toilet paper. That's the direction we're heading. 


Fed still buying debt and slowly increasing interest rates is only making you poorer and is already the beginning of a bail out. The soft landing is a softer bail out than 2008. So don't expect a 10% drop tomorrow or in the next month. 


All central banks will provide liquidity to corporations as they already have been. Don't fuck around too much in the next 9 months, unless you're betting on modest puts for the year end or Q1 '23. They will keep propping this bitch up just enough so nobody wins too big. 


I see the interest rates going up to 6-7% by the time they are done. We will see double digit inflation.

Impressive Growth Story:

On par with Twitter in million monthly active users last reported @ 69 million and that company is presently valued at around $44bn, in comparison Rumble is currently deeply discounted at a value of only $2bn-$3bn.

## Growth Story:

(**Excerpt from CEO on SEC filing**) Before this explosion of growth, we were doing roughly 1, 1.5 million monthly active users. In our first major leg of growth, we posted 21 million monthly active users in Q4 of 2020. By the summer, of Q3 of 2021, Rumble hit another leg of growth, hitting an average of 36 million monthly active users on the platform.

Rumble saw another massive leg of growth happen, averaging an average of 44 million monthly active users in Q2 of 2022. Then that takes us to now, and what we‚Äôve seen now is probably one of the most exciting times that I‚Äôve ever seen in running this business. We are now transcending politics. This has nothing to do with politics anymore. We hit 78 million monthly active users globally in August of 2022, with 63 million alone in just US and Canada.

# What makes them different:

Censorship has become a major problem on the YouTube platform for content providers and they are starting to take notice. I believe it‚Äôs about to reach a tipping point on its way to juggernaut status. Mainstream media and tech companies continue to ignore alternate viewpoints or actively try to suppress information.

Information suppression is likely to get worse after the midterm elections go badly for the democrats, with platforms likely to double down on their idea censorship. Rumble is a bootstrapped company whose main tenet is to resist censorship which will eventually cause a shift in the most popular names to move platforms to regain their freedom.

## Notable Investors:

May 19, 2021 - Peter Thiel and venture capital firm, Narya Capital, which was co-founded by author J.D. Vance. Narya‚Äôs Ethan Fallang will be joining Rumble‚Äôs board of directors.

Peter Thiel isn‚Äôt in the habit of losing money!

David Sacks - another member of the famed Paypal mafia was recently complaining that an episode of his popular podcast had been removed from YouTube without explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

## Nimble and actively recruiting

After Truth Social went live in February with a rocky start users couldn‚Äôt sign up because of glitches Rumble stepped in and migrated the platform to its cloud infrastructure in April.

It's planning on offering its cloud web hosting service with guarantees to uphold freedom of speech and plans to make it available to all users in 2023. [According to Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/), the $178 billion cloud services market, which grew by 37% in 2021, is dominated by the tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Google who all have questionable records on censorship.

The company is also quick to react to calls for content creators' cancelations one recent example is Joe Rogan‚Äôs who the media called to cancel before any decisions were made Rumble quickly stepped in with a $100 million contract offer.

# Conclusion

Take this lesson from the past as to why you should support free speech platforms even if you are not currently in need or personally affected:

*First, they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî Because I was not a Socialist.*

*Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äî Because I was not a Trade Unionist.*

*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî Because I was not a Jew.*

*Then they came for me‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.*

Back to the real DD. So we all know that most taiwan stonks are being hammered due to political tensions wtih China, and also inflation. 

On the China front, this is Taiwan, and HIMX's tech has become pretty integrated with most automobile and average household items like smart fridges and automobiles and nobody knows due to NDA NDA NDA. Taiwan and the West both play fair and respect IP, and HIMX has over 3000 patents. All three major companys like META, APPLE, MSFT, AND GOOGLE, SAMSUNG, VALVE, are creating AR/VR tech, and HIMX's ceo has been betting on this since 2015, with more emphasis on AUTOs and smart household items, which we are seeing a huge amount of shortages of. SO?? This means an American company will probably acquire it soon. 

INFLATION: When inflation starts investors tend to move away from growth stocks and put their money in safe havens. well HIMX is a pretty good safe haven, 5$ per share you get 1.25$ of divy per year. If it keeps dropping to 3$ they'll be the most undervalued stock in the history of the stock market if they happens I'll personally go down to wall street and pull the race card, this is unacceptable.

319,1662984213,xcazlt,1,"Google pays billions of dollars to other companies -- Apple, Samsung Electronics, etc. -- to keep its search as the default option on phones and in browsers, something the Department of Justice (DOJ) believes creates an illegal dominance over the search market.

Deals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business. The practice has gone on for years. Google, at one point, paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to a law suit filed in 2020.

DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn‚Äôt disclose the amount Google spends to remain the default search engine on browsers and U.S. mobile phones, but described it as ‚Äúenormous numbers,‚Äù reports Bloomberg.

‚ÄúGoogle invests billions securing defaults, knowing people won‚Äôt change them,‚Äù Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington, admitting that Google buys ‚Äúdefault exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.‚Äù

In 2019, Google began giving Android users in Europe a choice to select a provider to power a search box on their device's home screen, and as the default in Chrome when installed. The changes complied with a competitive European Union ruling. The EU fined Google, saying it had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.

The change gave users with a phone running the Android operating system and Chrome browser an option to customize and personalize their device, choose and change their search engine based on their preference. It included selecting the apps to download.

Google, for example, added private, decentralized search engine Presearch as a default option on all new and factory-reset Android devices in the U.K. and Europe.

Since Google added Presearch 2021, its daily searches have grown from about 200,000 a day to more than 4 million, said Alex Carrabre, head of growth at Presearch. ‚ÄúAt the peak it was 6 million per day in the past 20 months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just in the Europe economic area.‚Äù

Carrabre estimates Android has about 70% of smartphone market share in Europe, which means there‚Äôs strong potential for the fledgling search engine to grow its user base.

Google‚Äôs private contracts with companies like Apple, and Samsung form the basis of the DOJ‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit, which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws.

The trial isn‚Äôt expected to start until next year. Thursday‚Äôs hearing was a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google‚Äôs business.

Some of you are up a good chunk of change since I posted last week. I just want to reiterate for the newer people that is is not a squeeze play, this is not a get rich quick thing, this is not dependent on WSB. I am holding this for 10-15 years.

RISK: At this moment, this is a high risk binary play. This company will either go bankrupt or it wont. I am going to show you 6 years of DD showing why it will not go bankrupt.

**The Problem: Amyris has been lighting cash on fire for 10 years transitioning from biofuels to its lab-to-market vertically integrated precision fermentation platform. Look at this graph (10 years).**

https://preview.redd.it/8eg9fl1p8wm91.jpg?width=577&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30363fea0100b14f6f47078617984ca26d18a8e6

&amp;#x200B;

Even when we zoom in (below 1 yr) we see that the market absolutely loved the reveal of its ""Lab-to-Market"" platform but still is pricing it for bankruptcy because of the low cash on hand combined with cash burn.

https://preview.redd.it/fjnnsg8q8wm91.jpg?width=3319&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61c0951d7593d19495bc249db0234ebbc2ba6f1e

**Why Bankruptcy is off the table:** Since 2016 Amyris has been working on its vertically integrated lab-to-market platform and started pushing out brands based on molecules that it has scaled up. I'm sure either you, your wife, or her boyfriend may have heard of these brands.

https://preview.redd.it/rudk09wq8wm91.jpg?width=1336&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=505c684bbd1d674a8c3a66e7cc825edd99995da8

All of these brands are based off of molecules developed from Amyris' lab to market platform. Squalane, Hemi-Squalane, CBG, RebM, Ectoine, Bio Silica, derivatives of Farnesene etc. By the end of the year, Amyris will be the FIRST company to scale up 20 molecules more than all of its competitors combined.

Every molecule developed by Amyris is more sustainable than other methods. See RebM example below.

https://preview.redd.it/p2nb8gqr8wm91.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e19c007ab1794478726f05c665390a09fbc4118

&amp;#x200B;

The psychos over at the Amyris subreddit have realized that order numbers are sequential, so since 2017 we have been buying from all of Amyris' brands at the beginning and ending of each month to come up with Direct to Consumer Numbers.

https://preview.redd.it/ql5pjk2s8wm91.jpg?width=2131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4ad63eb73336f8751e3c37530e68e27df87db2

Amyris has been targeting beauty and cosmetics because this sector can have really fast market acceptance. Because of the ""Lipstick effect"", these brands will also do well during recessions. Not all brands will be a success, but that's ok!

Amyris also has names like John Doerr backing it, I'm pretty sure the guy behind Amazon and Google isnt going to let his synbio stock die off.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Now... none of this means that Amyris is safe. But it does mean there is an opportunity at hand. Here are the two events that we will be watching for.**

**1) What will Amyris' price be if it proves that it wont go bankrupt?**

**2) What will Amyris' price be if it proves that it is the first viable synbio company after (1)?**

**I don't know the answers to these questions... but I'm pretty sure its more than $3.70**

I think this is the last cup of tea before the 10 year tendie train takes off. There is also a big gap that can be filled.

## The problem: 41% of humanity is offline

Over a decade ago, internet access got established as a fundamental human right. However, 3.2 billion people remain offline. \[[1](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280222-The-Mobile-Economy-2022.pdf),[2](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-digital-divide-internet-data-broadband-mobbile/)\] Cellular dead zones plague the world, and 6% of global population doesn't even have cellular coverage.

Imagine how your life would be different without internet: no email, no Google, no YouTube, no Wikipedia, no social media, no chat apps. That's the reality for billions. And 6% of people \[[1](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280222-The-Mobile-Economy-2022.pdf)\] have it even worse - not just no internet access, but also no cellular coverage. Even calls with family or to emergency services can't be taken for granted by everyone, or everywhere.

Based on the current rate of the internet coverage expansion projected by the United Nations, the goal of getting 90% of the world‚Äôs population online won‚Äôt be achieved before 2050. \[[16](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/universal-internet-access-unlikely-until-2050-experts-say-lack-skills-investment-slow-growth)\]

Without aggressive innovation, meeting this target will take even longer. High initial costs of cell towers dramatically slow down connectivity expansion in the developing world. In the poorest nations, an internet connection is unaffordable for most. This won‚Äôt change as long as the necessary infrastructure remains expensive.

Countless people have died because they had no cellular connectivity to call for help.  
Lack of connection with the outside world dramatically adds to the monetary misfortune of the world‚Äôs poorest, closing doors to potential opportunities for lifting themselves out of poverty.

This is also bad for human civilization as a whole. Many geniuses came from impoverished backgrounds. There are currently hundreds of millions of children, many of them undoubtedly gifted - potential next Einsteins and Newtons and Elon Musks - with no internet access. Just imagine all their contributions if they were able to join the global academic and business community. There are historical cases of people with no formal training making substantial contributions to science, such as the fascinating story of Srinivasa Ramanujan \[[17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)\].

## The solution: turn all phones into satellite phones

Cellular coverage and internet access go hand in hand. 92.8% of internet users use mobile devices to go online most of the time. There are 5.27 billion unique mobile users, increasing each year rapidly. \[[18](https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview)\]

Today, only about 25 percent of the world‚Äôs landmass is served by cell towers, the rest has no coverage \[[19](https://lynk.world/our-technology)\]. Traditional terrestrial tower networks will never reach full global coverage, as there are no economic incentives to expand into low population density and low-income areas. For a solution, we must look to the sky.

Satellite constellations are magic made real. They provide robust wireless networks with global coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional terrestrial towers. The satellites can easily cover the whole planet, including the most impoverished regions. The services can then be priced accordingly in each region to be affordable by locals.

Many understand the gravity of the global connectivity problem and the economic opportunity that it presents. Recent technology advancements and the rapid decrease of payload to orbit costs started a commercial space race. Starlink from Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX and Project Kupier from Amazon are some of the most prominent players.

However, even the most advanced satellite constellations are of no benefit to those who can‚Äôt afford their services. Nearly all existing services require customers to purchase expensive hardware such as satellite phones (&gt;$1,000 for Iridium sat phone) or mounted terminals with powered antennas ($599 for a Starlink terminal \[[20](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991841/spacex-starlink-price-hike-inflation-user-terminal)\]).

For this reason, a space-based cellular broadband network which works with regular phones that people already own is the holy grail.

Until recently, the technology of direct satellite to unmodified mobile phone communication has been the stuff of imagination. AST SpaceMobile (ticker: ASTS) is now making it a reality.

It already proved their solution works by establishing space communication with their prototype satellite.

This in-depth report will analyze the AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS \[[22](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24asts)\]) stock as an investment.

We believe that if the company succeeds in its mission, it could bring shareholders eye-popping returns by 2030, e.g. as much as 50x\~ from a $10¬± entry price. This report explains how.

At Transhumanica Research, we focus precisely on opportunities like this: high pro-social returns for humanity and high potential financial rewards for visionary investors in our community.

In total, up to 10 MILLION shares will need to be purchased in this process. For context, that is **166 TIMES the average volume traded**. This is FUCKING INSANE

Similar situations have happened in the past, but the difference between the OI and average volume in this stock is magnitudes greater than any other plays I have seen before. If any upwards momentum happens, this shit is gonna take off  


This is designed to be a short-term play, but the long-term fundamentals of this are solid too  


**Long-term + Fundamentals:**

 GBTG has experienced over 200% revenue growth as it rapidly expands in the financial service and travel industry

[Source: Yahoo Finance \(7\)](https://preview.redd.it/hk2gin0v2nm91.jpg?width=820&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116c8c74fb7fc556bd352d02af780c5a1955378f)

 What makes GBTG different from its competitors is that it both services accounts and processes transactions. Their credit cards are geared specifically towards high net-worth individuals and people with excellent credit ratings, which makes their business much safer and less susceptible to economic downturns

GBTG has an average credit-card delinquency rate of only 0.8% (8), which is 2.25 times lower than the average CCDR (9)

As interest rates continue to rise, rates credit card companies charge consumers will increase (10), significantly increasing the CCDR of companies who issue cards and lend money to riskier consumers

 While not having a major impact on GBTG‚Äôs rate, which has held stable during this time period due to safe lending practices (11)

GBTG will be able to benefit from this by capturing further market share as competitors cut costs while defaults eat away at their earnings

This extreme growth and move towards profitability is slated to continue as they complete more deals with travel-related industries to lower costs, increase benefits, and capture more users

There are numerous other reasons why the long-term fundamentals of this company are incredible, but I gotta use my hands for something else after that juicy gain porn comes in so imma cap it off here...

Rumble is experiencing MASSIVE month-month / yearly growth. (currently 78M monthly average users for the month of August)

As more and more creators look for safe haven from being YouTube banned (because of politics/science/etc), they take shelter at Rumble, the ONLY free-speech platform, that is professional and lets you speak openly (within the boundaries of the law). 

Andrew Tate was recently banned off essentially ALL media platforms, (they all banded together and cancelled him), so he joined Rumble, and expressed why Rumble is important, and that everyone needs a company like Rumble to fight against Big-tech, so people can have their own opinions without being cancelled. He has asked everyone to rally together and Join Rumble, and create accounts there.

This has opened up the doors to entirely new demographic of user starting to join, and now with hints of Stevewilldoit/Nelk/Fullsend Being next up to join, due to cancellation.

More and more creators will start cross-posting their YouTube channels to Rumble, as just another source of revenue, whether they're cancelled or not. This will in turn spike the Monthly average users and ad revenue through the roof, and open the doors to more channels being cross-posted.

The company has a host of investors behind it, the most notable is Peter Thiel. This is his first media investment since Facebook. 

Rumble will be entering the cloud service space in the next year or so, they're already expanding what they currently have. (Truth Social from TMTG) is currently running on their cloud service infrastructure, and in the next year or so Rumble will open the doors to be commercially available. They also have a payment processor that is free of big-tech, and are in talks of a web browser.

They are advertising as being the ONLY free-speech, anti-censorship media platform AND hosting infrastructure on the markets. which IMO will be MASSIVE. These niche companies will always be a standout, especially if they have non-stop rolling catalysts from big youtube creators joining the platform in the process.

Rumble is a real pillar in the free-speech sector. They're even suing Google currently for 2B+ in damages, for google routing search results to YouTube, rather then other (smaller) video platforms like Rumble. You can search for a Rumble video SPECIFICALLY on google and it will bring up a YouTube video. Which is illegally favoring their own businesses. Rumble has now entered a stage in the lawsuit where Google will have to provide how their algorithms work when searching for things, to ensure they aren't favoring their own businesses (which they clearly are).. This could be a MASSIVE discovery.

Rumble plans on taking Marketshare from:

YouTube/google, AWS, Azure, and they're releasing tiktok format videos. 

With Trump, Andrew Tate, and a host of other notable creators likely to join, all backed by a free-speech driven CEO, this just screams ""meme"" status, but with real sentimental value.

* They seem to short companies on purpose by implementing bogus claims.

* I am convinced this firm engages in illegal short selling activities.

Consequently their news feed alerting investors coincided perfectly with a short seller attack on the stock the preceding day. The company has publicly stated and backed up their statements with proof that they have taken all steps possible to solve their NDA application with the FDA and are awaiting FDA guidance.

349,1662412010,x6rc8o,1," I just want to post this about my feelings regarding GSAT's future and the constant comparisons that GSAT can't compete and its satellites are just so old and their new satellites aren't going to compete is not being truthful about GSAT and its possibilities at this time in my opinion.The new 17 satellites will not be simple clones of the ones we have now. It's frankly simplistic to say so. The newer satellites will no doubt have higher capacities then todays current satellites have. Why? Technology has changed from 15 to 20 years ago. Are not our phones and laptops having significantly higher performance from so long ago? All chips made today are much higher in performance so it stands to reason so will our new 17 satellites being planned as we wait. Just so the board knows: GSAT's current constellation as it currently exists handled  1,800,000,000 messages a year. Read that on GSAT's website! More capacity is coming soon as the newer satellites are launched and put into use as I do not see Apple and GSAT settling for 20 year old technology. Everything has gotten smaller, faster and higher capacity over the last 20 years and so will our next generation satellites in my opinion, it just makes sense.  GSAT has the spectrum in the S-Band and C -Band to handle much more traffic than it does now. Uplink: L-Band (1610-1618.725 MHz)Downlink: S-Band (2483.5-2500 MHz)Terrestrial: S-Band (2483.5-2500 MHz)Uplink: C-Band (5091-5250 MHz)Downlink: C-Band (6875-7055 MHz)\*\* Above from the GSAT website 2021 PresentationNoticer the S-band: it can be used as a satellite downlink and we have the right to use it here terrestrially as well.There is no FCC filings that I know of that seeks to change any of the above.

# Going to the second quarters earnings release shows a company truly getting ready to fire on all cylinders.  Why:  The recognition and release of the large IOT order of 23K devices with the likely purchase of additional devices. As GSAT advised this is likely to be a breakthrough for additional contracts and sales to other companies. They have made significant hire's in the IOT field which in my opinion have already paid off.  This regarding production issues from the 2nd quarter release:  As we resume production over the coming days and weeks, we expect equipment revenue to be meaningfully higher in the second half of 2022, leading to further subscriber revenue growth. Demand, particularly for Commercial IoT service and products, has not faltered even in the face of material supply issues. Sales orders continue to build at an impressive pace, and we will fulfill these orders expeditiously. Band 53/N53 GSAT is pending to release of additional approvals to bring the total of over one billion pops. Greater the number of POPs the greater value. We know there is a term sheet involving Band 53/N53. We already know that this will lead to an increase in GSAT's value, we just don't when the agreement will be released. I can't see the release lasting much beyond the new year, likely sooner imo.  Also, we know they are actively refinancing the debt of the company and for the capital they need for the new constellation of satellites.  Last but not least: we have the filing for a brand new constellation of 3080 satellites with the ITU from I believe their German subsidiary. That constellation they have applied for would be the same size of Amazons potential project Kuiper. Large enough to compete with anyone!  And so we additionally wait to see if Apple will the other terms agreement entity. Will they buy us out or make payments, we don't know and we won't until the announcement is made.  However, without recognition of the payments made to one of the terms agreements, GSAT had 23% higher revenue 2nd quarter. With the above sectors all coming online should show increasingly higher revenues and 4th quarter should be the first actual profit I have seen the company have since I've been here, imo. And it will not be any larger number for the profit but if GSAT manages to pull it off it will lead to a change with any partners for IOT as companies want to make sure they are with a company that will still be in business.  This is why I am very bullish on the long run prospects of GSAT and/or anyone who purchases GSAT.  Let's remember, Starlink has nothing to show and no approvals to even do what they say they want to.  GSAT has been doing everything for the last 10 years and has regulatory approval for it all right now: VOICE/TEXT/IOT.   I think its important to note that all GSAT or anyone else is talking about is moving data: bits and bytes - he digital world as we know it. No matter who partners with GSAT or buys GSAT - it's only moving data and it is beyond me to think that if any Computer company buys GSAT that the engineers are not capable to make this work. Especially Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.   So yes I am tired hearing this can't be done or Starlink is the only one that can. All Starlink has right now is a name and thats it: No VOICE/IOT/TEXT. No regulatory approvals to do so. No application or software to make it so. No reason to fear them if we get a major technology company to partner with us or buy us.  What we will all have to do is wait for the NDA's to expire or permit GSAT to announce the partners or buyout and off we go. I hope.",GSAT,1.0,2022-09-05 21:06:50

If you think that monopolies are relics of the past, [this report](https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers) released by Open Markets Institute is a must-read. Here are some stunning excerpts:

* Since 1993, consolidation has reduced the number of large defense firms from 107 to five.
* Amazon sells¬†74 percent¬†of all e-books sold online, and it sells¬†64 percent¬†of all print books sold online.
* CVS and Walgreens control 89% of the drug store business.
* Google controls¬†[64 percent](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings/comScore-Releases-February-2016-US-Desktop-Search-Engine-Rankings)¬†of all desktop searches and¬†[94 percent](https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&amp;qpsp=2016&amp;qpnp=1&amp;qptimeframe=Y&amp;qpcustomd=1)¬†of all global and mobile tablet searches.
* Two companies, Mars and Hershey, control 75% of the candy market in America.

Big Tech companies are the most well-known offenders with a few companies controlling almost everything we do online.

While it‚Äôs Big Tech that captures all the headlines, almost all the industries are now dominated by a few companies. Look around your store the next time you go grocery shopping - you might think that as a consumer you have a plethora of choices. But in reality,

https://preview.redd.it/92tsiukag1m91.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aac3a72e7f926223c47fd47cb1c4826efd2109ab

There are arguments [for and against](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/economics-101-what-is-a-monopoly) a few companies controlling the majority of market share that are beyond the scope of this article. *The question which I‚Äôm interested in as an investor is* whether these companies tend to outperform the market and provide stable returns while doing so.

After all, Warren Buffett‚Äôs favorite types of business are the ones that have huge economic moats which are near-monopolies in the industries they operate in. Once, [asked at an annual meeting](https://www.barrons.com/articles/myth-of-capitalism-book-excerpt-51544500404) what his ideal business was, Buffett argued that it was one that had ‚Äúhigh pricing power, a monopoly.‚Äù The message is clear according to Buffett: If you‚Äôre investing in a business with competition, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.

### Monopoly Returns

Anyone who has played the Monopoly board game knows the unbridled joy of collecting rent for the properties you own and driving your competitors to bankruptcy. I wanted to see if the same process is reflected in real life where companies having a monopoly in certain sectors could drive out competitors, rise prices, and give an outsized return on investment.

If you try to do a backtest on the biggest monopolies of today, you would quickly run into hindsight bias. The companies that are monopolies now might or might not have been monopolies a decade back. For example, there was no way of knowing Google would dominate the in-app ecosystem in Phones, and that Amazon would be the king of cloud services back in 2010.

To overcome this, I went back in time *(using this* [*nifty little feature from Google*](https://mashable.com/article/google-search-by-date)*)* and searched for publications covering monopoly investments. I found two relevant articles that we can use for the analysis.

1. **The next 7 American Monopolies** \- [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-next-7-american-monopolies-2010-11?IR=T) (2010)
2. **The Forbes.com Monopoly Index** \- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/13/monopolyindex.html?sh=16b32f1e4a2d) (2001)

A total of 17 stocks were covered by the two publications. Our benchmark as always is the tried and trusted S&amp;P 500 as most of the companies covered in the research are large-cap stocks.

The results are incredible. Monopoly companies on average returned **double** that of the S&amp;P 500 benchmark during the same period. 65% of the companies in the list beat the benchmark and only in 2 cases would you have lost money on your investments (*yes, even adjusting for inflation).*

https://preview.redd.it/ao8m2c7fg1m91.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43451cf0978eaaa10288d1ec08438f899497d589

The results were so surprising that I checked academic research papers to see if what I was observing was in line with the norm *(as we are slightly away from the sample size required for significance)*. While there are no direct papers evaluating the performance of monopolies, established research shows that companies having large market share tend to outperform smaller competitors and the market.

[**Journal of Business &amp; Economics Research**](https://clutejournals.com/index.php/JBER/article/view/2756/2804) evaluated the performance of 85 companies (50 Large-Cap &amp; 35 Mid-Cap Firms) with wide economic moats.

&gt;*Relative to the market, the aggregate appreciation of large-caps surpassed more than 85 percent of all stocks and the mid-caps more than 78 percent. While there were individual laggards on both lists, they were relatively few in number. The author‚Äôs subset demonstrated the most pronounced gains. All three lists would have handily surpassed the S&amp;P benchmark during the benchmark period.*  
*Source:* [*Is sustainable competitive advantage an advantage for stock investors?*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151)

[**Applied Economics**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151) investigated the stock returns of companies with sustainable competitive advantage (the moat).

&gt;*Our results indicate that Wide Moat stocks have created significant value for their investors. An equal and value-weighted portfolio of these companies rebalanced annually has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 3000 indices over the period of our study (June 2002‚ÄìMay 2014).*

### Conclusion

I wish this would be as simple as investing in companies in industries having a high concentration. But, as always, all the simple &amp; direct strategies tend to be captured already in the market. [Recent studies](https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/monopolies-are-distorting-the-stock-market) indicate that

&gt;*Stocks in concentrated industries trade at higher multiples as the market is smart enough to recognize their monopoly power. Therefore, an investment strategy that simply buys companies in concentrated industries does not outperform.*

This does not mean all is lost - We just have to go one step deeper. The same studies show that you can outperform the market by:

a. **Investing in industries with rising concentration** as the market seems slow to recognize their increased prizing power

b. **Adding a layer of valuation metric** \- When monopoly companies run into difficulty, investors tend to underestimate their ability to rebound and undervalue their shares.

So the next time you‚Äôre considering a stock for long-term investment, add this layer to your analysis: Does the company have prospects of growing into a monopoly or dominant player in a market with just a few players, or is it a lucrative market where competitors can eat away the profits? The first is what you should bet on.",Investing in Monopolies,1.0,2022-09-05 13:04:09

‚ÄúCome close my son and join me at the hearth. Listen well to my tale.‚Äù (Me)

Point One ‚Äì Ryan Cohen and his ever expanding Merry Band of Badasses established a rally point in Gamestop via the turn around. They are using the Company as a vehicle for innovative change that probably should have already happened over the last 30 years.

Point Two ‚Äì NFT Platform ‚Äì Loopring technology integrating Inter-Planetary File System by Pi√±ata in which every single piece of Intellectual Property has a specific serial number encoded thus prohibiting fraud or spoofing. Anything from a tree, a bottle of whiskey, or even a Stock/Security. Alpha &amp; Beta have been a Proof-Of Work to various titans of commerce, and you can expect reveals of integrating partners relatively soon.

If I had to hazard a guess, I would say that the Merry Band of Badasses (larger now) have acquired the meat and potatoes of Loopring as a corporation. They likely have purchased either License or the entirety of the Loopring Patent for a Blockchain Decentralized Exchange. This would give them leverage against anyone in Finance, or the Grubnerment trying to lean on them. This also hedges against corruption or cronyism via bureaucrats and politicians.

Point Three ‚Äì Gamestop can act as an agent and trustee of another corporation. They filed with the SEC, and it was approved. (They have also registered GMERICA Entertainment LLC in many countries throughout the world, if you haven‚Äôt been paying attention. U.S., Canada, United Kingdom‚Ä¶) This means that Gamestop is free to restructure or reorganize their assembling conglomerate at will. This means that Gamestop (or GMERICA) will be a parent company like Alphabet is to Google. BBBY or BaBY or Blockbuster (theorized that they were seeking a purchase from ATT/Direct TV who has done jack all with the Brand/I.P.) will all be divisions of the larger corporate entity.

Point Four ‚Äì A Wild Speculation ‚Äì Ryan Cohen is still working with Bed, Bath, and Beyond. He cannot own stock in both companies while pursuing an Acquisition or Merger. According to their Agreement, he can at any time purchase up to 20% of shares available to the public. If Gamestop doesn‚Äôt acquire all of BBBY, they will be acquiring BuyBuy Baby. This transaction will force all direct and derivative action of BBBY *and* Gamestop to be closed out. Securities and Stock Trades, Options, *Swaps*, and even *ETFs* will have to be settled. (Here, I can can either cash out here, during MOASS, or I can HODL for generational wealth.)

Gamestop has 304.52~ million shares available to the public as well as 5.00~ million preferred stock, and 8~ million Class A Common Stock available as compensation and incentives to their employees. We‚Äôll say 318 million even. They still have a ceiling of 1,005,000,000 Class A Stock, leaving roughly 682~ million available for the Board of Directors to work with. What can happen in an Acquisition or Merger? Stock Distributions.

BBBY| -&gt; GME + BBBY = BBBY Holders get GME Stock.

BBBY |-&gt; BBBY | BaBY  = BBBY Holders get BaBY Stock.

‚ÄúBBBY |-&gt; BBBY | BaBY|‚Äù -&gt; BaBY|-&gt; GME + BaBY = Certain BBBY and BaBY Holders get GME Stock.

Tl;dr: [I bought BBBY because Gamestop is either buying all of BBBY or just BaBY. I am hoping that Gamestop buys a Carved Out/Spun Off BaBY so that I get to keep BBBY, get BaBY, and then get converted into Gamestop so that I have multiplied moon tickets while having purchased BBBY for pennies on the dollar.]( https://i.imgur.com/oV9iHdc.png)",A Vested Interest In The Future of GME(RICA): An Abridged Version (BBBY/BaBY Acquisition Tin Foil),1.0,2022-09-04 04:33:44

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/holders?p=BYND

8.73% of shares held by insiders, 70.77% of shares held by institutions = 79.5% of the stock that can't be traded because of insider trading or something idk google it.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/key-statistics/

63.67M shares outstanding, minus insider/institutional ownership leaves only 13.05M shares available for the public to trade

on the same page you can see 19.5M shares short.  now this is only what is voluntarily reported, obviously because hedgies are criminals you can triple this to get the real number.

so now because of RegSHO the hedgies have to cover their shorts by buying 60M shares but there are only 13.05M shares held by real human beings.  stock price -&gt; moon guaranteed.

Hedge funds Short AMC.  
Retail investors bought AMC to short squeeze it.

Hedge funds held short positions even though they shouldn't be able to. It looks sketchy as hell. AA - Silverback - also AMC's CEO - did a split dividend which was APE. This duplicated ALL ORDERS into APE. So if you were short 1000amc now, you were short 1000amc AND 1000ape. Therefore all of the short positions were copied into APE.   
So now you have a ton of hedge funds shorting APE.  
NOW when the shorts cannot be covered, the ticker is added to: [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Why this is important because if it remains on this list for over 13 settlement days. The brokers are FORCED to CLOSE the positions, aka buy back the shares. Now AMC hit this list and then went off, you all say. AMC has options, and with options, you can do fuckery. APE DOES NOT. AA - the silverback made sure APE had T+0 Clearing time and NO OPTIONS.. What that means is. IN A FEW DAYS' TIME, ALL the brokerages will be closing all those damn shorts on APE. So if you want to be part of the fuckery of the century and stick it to the illegal fucks.

363,1662009371,x2z211,1,"Last night, during my little ape slumber, I had a dream of waking up to news of the BBBY announcement sending the share price skyrocketing up to like $30. When I woke up for real (MST), I reached for my phone and started to google ‚ÄòBBBY‚Äô with only one of my ape eyes open. I saw $70 some odd bucks and smiled to myself. I thought about the tweet I read a while back saying ‚Äúnext everybody decides to make $10k without doing anything can you let me know‚Äù referring to the GME craze. I thought I had done it, that I hadn‚Äôt missed out this time around. I snoozed for like 5 more minutes then got ready for work and left. I was giddy when I got to the office. I opened up my browser to rejoice in the beauty that was BBBY @ $70. Turns out I was looking at Best Buy when I was half awake.  I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt request time off first, before market gazing.

I was comfortable losing everything I had invested in BBBY so I guess I‚Äôm a share holder for life.

While I'm sure there is a small % who got into this who have to cut their losses because it's money they can't afford to lose, there's got to be a lot of people aren't going to do that because they have literally nothing to gain apart from less of a loss on money they were happy to gamble with anyway?

I think there is a demographic of people who have between $5k-$50k of savings they can afford to lose, who YOLO it, and then won't pull it out because the irony is - while tens of thousands sounds like a lot - that amount of money is a drop in the ocean when it comes to buying a decent house.

I'm wondering if what unifies this community is sheer fucking apathy and that's what makes people hold (it's definitely what made me jump in in the first place). In a world where cost of living and house prices are fucking bonkers, all I'm losing is money that would have bought me a disappointing house in the first place. The fucking median US house price is $429k and the mean is $508k if Google is to be believed - I live in the UK and it's the same story here.

I wonder if this complete lack of giving a fuck is something financial institutions underestimate and find it difficult to fit an algorithm to. I'm holding not only because I'm stupid but *because I simply don't care.* I think a lot people are in this boat, and see the deck as already too stacked against them for them to care.

To BUSINESS!

Forget Fun-dementials, SHF, forget Cohen, forget all that fluff. Since the dawn of time, early bird got the worm. Is the bird smarter? Is it stronger? Is it just lucky? Dunno. Don't give a shit. When you surf a wave, you don't ponder where in the ocean it got started. You catch it EARLY, and you HOLD THE FUCK ON.

I've been seeing some people struggle with the play here, and the whole ""rEaSoN"" why we're here.

Okay. From the top.

SCENARIO 1:
Fellas. Let us begin by assuming we are all pretty much dead wrong. In that case, the big shorts know how to trick us, the SI is dead wrong at &gt;100%, And we're essentially doing a soft but very public pump n' dump.

MEANING:
JUST PLAY THE FUCKING PYRAMID. This isn't a team sport, fuck you and don't fuck your wife cuz she got AIDS from me. Sure. It's slimy AF. But what the fuck isn't in Wall Street? Eat your crayon and fuck your watermelon.


SCENARIO 2: 
Okay, let's assume we're  NOT wrong, but obviously this lovely ape poop echochamber/toilet is making us hear our own ape noise as whispers of the deep state. A'ight. Let me present to you two exhibits to google. ""GameStop short squeeze"" and ""Self-induced consensus of Reddit users to characterise the GameStop short squeeze"".
The exhibits TLDR is, more than any other manipulation or attempt to influence us, the biggest factor here is NATURAL MOMENTUM. Essentially, Jimmy isn't wrong and incompetent (I DONT BELIEVE THAT BUT ROLL WITH IT) and probably not paid by hedgies, at the very very very least not directly. Nor does he have a major stake in this. NOBODY does. Not Yahoo, CNBC... ANYONE. Only sad HF managers and some rich but not exotically rich asscunts.
(remember guys. SCENARIO. Not my opinion nor my inverse opinion.)

APE BRAIN HURT, EXPLAIN IN NOISES!:
We're literally inviting anyone who agrees with us how dumb the shorts are to play this to our side. Not because they ""like"" us, but because that's the only play.
What would you do if you ran BlackRock? Attempt a strategy with infinite risk or claim that risk to your pocket?
EXACTLY. (refer to ""Gains by existing shareholders and third parties"" under ""Impact on involved entities"" on exhibit A).

Also, see my note below if you're interested in the future of Wall Street as a whole, and why I think we're literally the grave diggers for shorts for the rest of history (or until H. sapiens forget. They do that alot.)

SCENARIO 3:
Basically, not only is every positive verification of our retarded notions from S2 are correct, but so are ALOT of our theories.

I'm saying, for example
-Major mass-media players really are held by extremely wealthy and risk-loving 1%ters.
-Jimmy really does sell instructions for dummies, rather than being an ""ExPeRIEnceD TraddeRRR""
-Rich people know other rich people, and are more likely to be connected in a social sense. (That's just a pure fact. Why do you think nepotism is a thing? Why do you think the gov bails out banks when it doesn't have to? and so on). Meaning, even if ""legally speaking"" they're golden, the TL;DR is you're less significant for their daily life than a fly that flew into their room. a fly they never noticed. THAT'S how insignificant you are to them.

OOH OOH AHH AHH!: 
Yes my friend, in-deed.

SCENARIO 4:
Basically, scenario 3++. RC/Someone is playing 5D chess, and a major sort of merger/acquisition/whateverthefuck is incoming. Gogl ""Kroger BBBY"". Is it true? I HAVE NO CLUE.

MEANING??!!!!:
That we're going to 1000$. I kid you not. Sure, I pulled that number out of my ass, but that's where I get the feces I throw at non-apes. Seems like a good place to look.
An acquisition means THERE'S A LONG PLAY.
***I AM NOT SAYING 1K WILL STAY THE PRICE. I MEAN THAT'S THE PEAK OF THE SQ I THINK IS POSSIBLE***

So, I think that is enough to text to assert my dominance over you. All of these scenarios are ALREADY highly likely.
BUT WAIT, you ask,


*HOW THE FUCK IS THERE A LONG PLAY, YOU FUCKING CROOK*

Look, retards. All the FUD about retail shops dying breaks down into 4

1. Amazon (and co.)
2. COVID
3. America, and along with it, THE WORLD, playing it fast and loose since the Information revolution began.
4. Worker shortages (refer to 3)

They are all complete bullshit. I'll explain

Worker shortages are pretty easy to explain. With the rise of automation and the ""common man"" being more informed than ever before, we just have people understanding entry lvl jobs are pretty much lite slavery with extra steps. Social security and working condition laws are a JOKE in the US. I'm sorry.

Fast and loose with credit - Refer to the 2008 Subprime mortgage crisis, the 1987 crash, the motherfukin great recession, and of course - The fall of the CCP by the hands of the Chinese mortgage uprising/two-way-rape. (Look up ""Github china mortgage"". It's scary and hilarious and wonderful.)

COVID. The mother of all poor excuses. I'm not even touching that.

FINALLY!
AMZN is going down. Why? take your damn pick. Workers' rights' movements are on the rise. A lot of sections are flooded with cheap, Winnie-Pooh made GARBAGE. Stock prices at an all time high. Bozos is playing with rocket fuel with his private capital. competitors are slowly catching up.
And besides all that shitstorm, you have two more critical things. ONE, retail will make a comeback, unless we're all uploaded to the cloud anytime soon. It won't kill amazon let alone ecommerce, but it will recover and thrive moderately, like it used to in 2010-2015. 
TWO. We're headed into a bloody recession. Cheap cloud storage? undercutting ecommerce? bloody CLOUD CHIPS (sup, Annapurna)????
Whatt does any of that matter if NOBODY HAS ANY FUCKING MONEY. E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E IS GOING TO LOSE. even US.
Prepare for fucking soup for the unemployed on the streets. WHO IS GONNA FUCKING BUY ANYTHING? WHAT FUND/INST WILL INVEST IN STARTUPS? NO. ONE.
copy and paste all that shit for BBY, WALMART, whatever. Only one I'm afraid of is COSTCO, and luckily they're not a threat.

This isn't advice.
This isn't an expert's thesis.
I am not an expert. I never finished grade school.
This isn't proper analysis. This is a wall of copypasta I literally got off of the CIA's alien document drawe, which ofc doesn't exist.

I'm just going to assume the attention span here is like mine, and hence equatable to a fkn rock. As such, here's some incentive to get you to make it down to the bottom because at the bottom is what comes **next. For G.M.E, B.B.B.Y, and any other tickers that come back from the dead.**

# Preface^2:

If you do not recognize the title of this post, I highly encourage you to read what came before, as the material contained within this DD is a direct follow-up to The Castle of Glass. It‚Äôll make what comes next far easier to understand, as this shit runs deeper than Kenny G‚Äôs rectum after the pounding he‚Äôs taken over the last 9 months.

**G.C1 - (I** can't link shit outside the sub. Uh, just look for the above title in my profile or google it or someshit lol.)

Where in G.C1, I described to you the ***‚Äòwhat‚Äô****,* this follow-up is here to show you the ***‚Äòhow‚Äô***. The former was insightful in providing us with the general direction that the company has been heading towards. A solution that would not only eradicate those who made the greatest mistake in shorting the company *but nearly every other financial entity that played their role in it.*

Yet, understanding the solution is only half of the equation. Make it through to the end and you‚Äôll see ***why I waited 2 whole-ass months to drop this thermonuclear watery shitfart on these Shortbus scum***. **So fasten those fkn helmet belts and unbutton your nip pouches. Where G.C1 is me to my wife, what comes next, is most certainly her boyfriend.**

# Phase I - The Foundation

In asking how R.C plans to execute their order 66, you must first understand why any of the following is even worth considering. In doing so, we have to take a look back to Overstonk.com and see precisely what they did and why it worked for them. Not from my own words, but from those of the CEO of the company, Robert Byrne and Dale Kimball the judge who dictated the ruling in the company‚Äôs favor in regard to their blockchain-based dividend that squeezed their own company.

In 2017, Byrne held a live presentation discussing the functionalities of Blockchain and why it prevails over the dumpster fire we currently call our stock market. This fucker was onto something...but just ***how much was he onto?*** After watching the whole presentation there are two specific moments in which he explains just this. (Link in O.G post)

**12:00 min mark**: in his discussion of the **D.T.C.C** and an entity known as **Cede and Co,** he asks the crowd to raise their hand if they own any stock in a publicly-traded company in America. A rhetorical question, to which he follows up by stating the following:

**‚ÄúAll of us with our hands up are incorrect. none of you actually own any stock, you legally do not own any stock, I‚Äôm going to show you what you own. All of the shares are owned by a company no one‚Äôs ever heard of, they own 98% of the corporate stock. They generate a share entitlement, basically what a casino would call a marker, what you and I would call an I.O.U‚Äù. He compares the stock to a polaroid, ‚Äúyou put the stock here, you take a photo and we trade the polaroid.**

Here‚Äôs a frame-by-frame of the chart he uses, broken down into 4 segments as to how this process proceeds. Follow 1-4. Don‚Äôt judge my fuggin arrows, 15 attempts each to get those right lol.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/co2m8eflysk91.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1f1672c436428faa84bf2c1ba7f3095e7e33ae)

1. Creation of the entitlement of the O.G share, i.e I.O.U.
2. Movement of I.O.U into the D.T.C.C and the exchange process between funds and the I.O.Us.
3. Distribution to clearing brokers (yellow circles), he states is, ‚Äúdirectly plumbed to the D.T.C.C. Besides them, there are about 3,500 other firm brokers plumbed into them‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou have a hub and spoke system where spokes become the hubs of new spokes‚Äù.
4. He then states, ‚Äú***these share entitlements are scattered through the system and there isn't a 1:1 relationship between the share entitlements and the underlying shares, and that's what I freaked out about 12 years ago. Its fractional reserve banking without a reserve requirement‚Äù***

Let's all take a moment of silence to look at that last picture. That‚Äôs our market. Right now. The dumpster fire. Visualized. Lmao and they think we're idiots. That shit show circus carnival is so ridiculously convoluted, it‚Äôs no wonder why it‚Äôs been so easy for them to get away with their fuckery for decades within it.

Above, he brings attention **to the problem**. Shortly after, he discusses the ***solution.*** This is where shit gets interesting. Also, before some dingle comments some headass shit about it lol, **coins =/= N.F.Ts, the only link they share is the Blockchain platform they run on, as discussed next.**

A platform he describes as allowing, ‚Äúpeer-to-peer value-exchange, ***without central institutions, disrupting the central institutions doing it for us now and adding TRUST into the equation‚Äù***

**17:30 min mar**k - He describes the alternative to the current dumpster fire, through the utilization of a hardware wallet-based ***ledger,*** which adds a new level of security in protecting your assets and keeping fuckery at bay. **The concept is explained below but hold onto it for later as it‚Äôs going to play a fat dicken role when we get to** ***N.F.Tittiesssss.***

1. He notes it as being ‚Äúcryptographically protected, as well as ***public and transparent.‚Äù.*** In the act of settlement, money acts as coins on the ledger and the stock becomes diff kinds of assets on that ledger.
2. In proceeding with the transaction, you take the currency, w/e it may be, from the boomer (left) and exchange it with an asset from the Chad (right).

***Damn..doesn‚Äôt that seem a metric fuckton of a lot easier than that circus shitshow carnival displayed above? It‚Äôd be a real tragedy for anyone who profits dearly off the current dumpster fire‚Äôs fuckery, if a company were to take this to the next level‚Ä¶***

* To further validate the efficiency of this system, Byrne further states the following, ***‚ÄúAnd there are no opportunities for mischief.*** ***Imagine a version of wall street that can't be cheated, that all kinds of mischief that people have gotten up to can't even be done in this world. A version of WS governed not just by regulators, but by laws of mathematics and cryptography. A friend of mine said they‚Äôll have to come up with a new name for it, ‚Äòlols‚Äô‚Äù.***

# Phase II - A Historical Precedent

We‚Äôve discussed the CEO, and now comes the court filing and the response given by the Judge. Credit for discovering the video I‚Äôve described above and the following information goes to u/ Minuteman\_Capital. He encountered a similar level of suppression when releasing this insight 2 months back, to G.C1. Within his post, he provides the direct court filings which substantiate the precedence for the ruling decided in Overstock's favor. But truly you must see the words of the judge for yourself to believe this shit.

Here are the 4 counts filed against overstock which would later be dismissed by the judge -

* Personally, it reads pretty damn similar to his breakdown. One thing I specifically want you to pay attention to is the final statement I underlined in red (above pic), in regard to the Judge‚Äôs statement higher up. **That part is critical to keep in mind, as it provides solid backing into how G.M.E is very likely able to substantiate their** ***own*** **move with a similar approach.**

At this point, you should have a decent understanding of ***the Foundation that yeets us to the next dimension,*** *as well as* ***the Precedent to execute such a move.*** In phase III we will be discussing ***the method of execution.*** \*If you made it this far...\*well first, I‚Äôm proud of u :‚Äô), secondly, ***hold onto ur fkn helmets cuz shit is about to get wild AF.***

# Phase III-a: D.A.O-N.F.Ts

Many of you may already know what N.F.Ts are but here‚Äôs a refresher, and another concept that is absolutely critical for you to keep in mind and understand, known as D.A.Os (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). Why do you need to know both of these? Because they are directly linked to one another, and the first part of the answer we‚Äôre looking for.

(I‚Äôm directly highlighting shit from this fantastic fuckin page and I have no desire for redundancies. Also, this saves word count for me #finesse)

**N.F.Ts and D.A.Os:**

[See OG post in profile for link](https://preview.redd.it/hxgxyfwvysk91.png?width=815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a7fbbdb75d9d0e446c75eb744c533d42ba730eb)

Seriously...**read that shit if you just skipped down to this paragraph lol.** Continuing...now that you understand the link between these two, the question begs, ***what in cinnamon toast fuck am I getting onto?***

# Phase III-b: The Automated Market Maker.

To answer this, I need to provide some insight into a company a few of you may have heard about already, known as Loopring, which is known as ‚ÄúAn open-sourced, audited, and non-custodial exchange and payment protocol.

https://preview.redd.it/owq85cm1zsk91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e96bc1dfed6ffff53c103cbc1a0b6e37a9c0a3e

 \*\*Oh boy‚Ä¶\**so the NEW dealer can resell the* ***NEWLY ISSUED series of securities, for which there is NO currently established market***. Well isn‚Äôt that something...b/c last I checked...\****LOOPING isn‚Äôt just some company capable of doing literally this...they‚Äôre quite literally THE company that has direct links to Gamestop. THE company for which Gamestop is likely planning to utilize in its release of an N.F.T marketplace.*** 

#  Phase III-b continued

**You guys didn't think I just threw in that D.A.O - N. F. T connection for shits and giggles did ya?** Well, guess what type of classification Loopring also falls under\*\*? Decentralized. Autonomous. Organization.\*\* But I fancy more evidence. *So how about we go to an entity that many of you would* ***least expect to further validate this information?*** **That‚Äôs right. The fuckin S. E. C.** In my search to learn more about re*securitization*, I would stumble across this page (search 'Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading') and within the source list, a White Paper that would contain some pretty unbelievable shit  (see O.G post in profile for link).

What is this dickslappin page? **The holy. Fuckin. Grail.** It‚Äôs an 18 pg document discussing an investigation on one of the *very first D.A.O entities, literally called* ***The D.A.O***\*.\* Though now defunct due to an ‚Äòattacker‚Äô utilizing an error in the code to siphon money out of the crowd-funded company (\*\*willing to bet this was done by none other than the fucboys currently deep in shit water..\*\*lol that's just me though), these funds would be returned to the original investors via a ‚Äòhard-fork‚Äô.

Fewer retard words, more tit slapping evidence though. After going through the entire document, here are a couple of statements you‚Äôll find interesting -

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/v9krc1j90tk91.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a811c1f94424119b9de3dea9ae71372bfe8ea00)

We aren‚Äôt looking at this shit because of the crowd-sourced company called *The D.A.O* in the discussion here, but **instead,** ***the premise behind its concept. The same fuckin premise that current D.A.Os are founded upon***...literally go back up and read them again and compare if you need to. Only difference?

**The concept is being** ***validated by the dingleberries that ‚Äòregulate‚Äô our market***. Also, notice any terms I talked about in **Phase I?** How about the *utilization of a fkn* ***LEDGER?*** Yeah...I told you that fucker Byrne was onto something..but..

**I came here for another reason.** At the very bottom of the paper document, **Section D**, which discusses the qualifications for an exchange that is ***separate from that of ‚Äòstock exchanges‚Äô we know of currently.***

**Section 3(a)(1)** of the Exchange Ac**t defines an ‚Äúexchange‚Äù** as ***‚Äúany organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a marketplace or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood*** ‚Ä¶ .‚Äù 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78c(a)(1).

So, how many coincidences is it going to take this time? 6? 9? 69? Let's throw in one last thing. One last part. You‚Äôre almost done, and so are **they.** There remains only **one last thing.**

The thermonuclear dickslap of a move across any shortbus hedgefund and Co member out there, priority-mailed directly by Gamestop‚Äôs excellent delivery services.

# Phase IV - The Castle of Fragments. 7 4 1

Everything I‚Äôve shown you thus far has led to this final phase. The final act. The answer which I believe has been staring us in our face, as to how it all goes down. In part 1, I left you apes with a statement as follows - ""simplicity...simplicity in a complex situation, is leaving the complex situation entirely. Their system and all of its cracks, cannot be unseen, nor undone. To replace a system that is so evidently flawed with its complexities requires a simple solution\*, leaving it behind entirely, and creating something new.\*

If you noticed this, then the immediate question to ask is ***how does one simply leave a rigged game?***

The answer has been in front of us for so long. The same way the zombie stocks had been, yet we apes forgot how to do simple math. What I show you from here, I leave to ***each and every one of you to decide what you believe***\*\*.\*\* ***How many coincidences does it take, before what you see, is no longer such a thing?***

So I offer you the insight brought forth to me by an ape that played a pivotal part in deducing the following, all I did was follow his trail. That number isn't a date. It isn‚Äôt some ruling. It isn‚Äôt anything other than a **simple answer and equation.** 

The answer: **You leave.**

The math:

**721 + 20 = 741.** Let's rewrite that one more time‚Ä¶ **E. R. C**. **721 + E. R. C. 20 = 741. The equation is equivalent to** ***Anti-life***, ***that is...of every single short-sided entity***\*\*.\*\* The bridge that gaps between **this market..and the next.** As such, I argue that the ***Castle of Glass*** *does not simply disappear. No, I‚Äôd argue‚Ä¶it comes crashing down and when it does it shatters into* **millions of pieces.** ***Millions of fragments.***

A concept that is an **F-N.F.T.** The ***fractionalization of Non-Fungible Tokens.***

**In their prospectus filing G.M.E states that if the entities that were positioned to complete their role as depository** ***failed at their task*****, they would issue** ***new*** **global security. ASingular global security** ***retaining the value of the entire float.*** **Condensed down into a singular conduit.** 

**One such as E.R.C.721.**

*Why* E.R.C.721 though? I‚Äôd argue...because *it* ***IS*** **the bridge.** This singular, *novel, global security...retaining the* ***entire value of the float*** **is the security existing on a new game. One distanced from the fuckery and manipulation running deep through the veins of the current market as we know it.**

But equating the float to singular global security begs the question. ***How*** would you redistribute such a thing? **Resecuritization, tokenization, and most importantly...fractionalization of E.R.C.721 smart contracts into derivatives, in a sense.** Fragmenting this N.F.T into **an equivalent amount of E.R.C.20** ***tokens***\*\*.\*\* ***Each is unique and unlike any other.*** Holding the ability to be more than *just a dividend.* **Holding true...real value. The value can be utilized for so much more. Limits uncapped.** But alas, my word is only just that. Mere words. I encourage you to **see for yourself.**

That‚Äôs right, an entity such as Loopring. I‚Äôll even go as far as saying that it *doesn‚Äôt HAVE to be Loopring* who acts as such a mediator in this move. Though the evidence is hard to ignore, the thing to realize is ***how this process occurs and which type of entities are capable of executing it***\*\*. D.A.Os,\*\* specifically those which are **A.M.Ms** and thus fall under the **A.T.S exemption,** as per the S.E.C.

The king of 69D chess went as far as ***trapping these dipshits into a position he KNEW they would take***. This is *what* the whole premise of the last prospectus was. Gametop *knew* that Shortbus and Co would take the last 5 million share offering and utilize it for *continued fuckery...instead of covering.* **The thing about those shares though? They came with some serious strings attached.** Gamestop specifically stated that *if and WHEN* they decide to issue an alternative type of payment to their investors who bought those shares (principle, **dividend**, interest, etc)...that **those would HAVE to be paid down the line.** ***IF the respective entities FAILED at completing such a task, their actions will trigger G.M.Es trap card.*** I.e their ability to ***reissue global security equating to the entire float through another platform. A platform that need not have ANY ties to the current exchanges nor the fuckery within it.***

**The kind of global security could do such a thing?** ***A smart contract such as E.R.C.721 can be fractionalized into TOKENS through a D.A.O Automated Market Maker. Once distributed, it would equate to the release of the thermonuke...one which the shorts set off themselves. A share recall to follow suit, and a squeeze not ONLY on one market...but quite possibly, two.***

# Stocks. Are. Fractionalized. N F Titties. 

You can't make this shit up. He has an entire post on Medium's website written about this....in *2019.*

# In Conclusion.

**Let's ask ourselves: What has Ryan Cohen said, that has gotten an All-star executive team from the world's leading companies, a team of leading n.f.t/defi/blockchain experts to drop everything they were doing without a second thought to work for** ***Gamestop***?‚Äù I know we've all asked ourselves this question many times over many months.

**Consider how stunning it can be how** ***oblivious*** **the outer world is to what is going on with G.ME, and let's ask ourselves why would some of the most elite business executives and defi devs, on top of their respective sections of that outer world that is so oblivious, come to work for a company the outer world seems utterly certain will fail.**

**Might it be that he described G.M.Es plans to pioneer the first major corporation moving its core business and downright equity securitization to blockchain/defi, which would irrevocably change the world forever and also probably trigger the short squeeze?**

# TL;DR (edited): I get it, it's still long as dick, but just remember how many eons it took your ass to scroll this far, lol.

Might as well finish it out.

**Everything below is backed and validated by evidence and sources. Don't trust my ass tho, I can lie. Verify for yourself, then come to your conclusion.**

**Phase 1** \- I provided insight from the C.E.O of Overstock himself via a video breakdown in which he explains the current problem with our markets, i.e the fact we don't own a single share in anything, but ***a 'marker' of them***. Discussed his explanation of **Cede and Co (contains OG shares)**, they get sent off to the **D.TC.C (marker shares),** which then trade down the line through **brokers, market makers, hedge funds, and so forth,** until they reach **you**. It's a shitshow carnival. The solution, as per the CEO, is based on the E.t.h blockchain and he explains its efficiency. (video is from 2017).

**Phase 2 -** Broke down the court filings for the overstock short squeeze and why the appointed judge pretty much said fuck you, to the hedge funds that tried to take the company to court on bs charges. The precedent for the judge's decision lays the groundwork for why *G.M.E* can not only do the same but has an even greater argument to take similar action.

**Phase 3 -** Broke down of **D.A.O (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and N.F.Ts.** As well as how **they are** ***directly linked***. Followed up by introducing a D.A.O known as Loopring, which is the next generation of protocol fo**r layer 2 E.T.H blockchain,** and acts as an **A.M.M (automated market maker)**. Provided evidence for their ***direct link to Gamestop and how the latter is planning to utilize them for their new marketplace.*** This is done through revisiting the prospectus language last seen in GC1, along with the **S.E.Cs** ***own*** **documentation as to why it is something they allow.**

**Phase IV - The holy fuckin grail. The true meaning behind 741 = E.R.C.721 (smart contract) + E.R.C.20 (fractionalized token) = 741.** This is the execution. The ender of the first game and the start of **New Game +.** GME traps shorts through their 1st share offering of 5m shares which had massive strings attached. The minute those were shorted, HF = fukt. **G.M.E states they can issue new security on a novel market if the depository in control fails to issue an alt payment sent out to their investors (Dividend). Since they shorted the shares...they would be forced to get em back. Which they can't. So either the D.T.C does a recall or G.M.E leaves, and the recall happens on its own. E.R.C.721 = global security holding valuation of the entire float, but existing on E.T.H blockchain. It is the bridge over. E.R.C.20 = a fragment of E.R.C.721 equal to not just the OG float...but** ***also every other synthetic created held by apes.*** **It can be dished out on the new market, in which the announcement alone of...would trigger the squeeze, not on one market...but** ***two.***

While everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple‚Äôs valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.

A lot of people treat Apple like it‚Äôs the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:

&gt;P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  
&gt;  
&gt;P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  
&gt;  
&gt;P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  
&gt;  
&gt;P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  
&gt;  
&gt;D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  
&gt;  
&gt;Long term debt: $93B  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Earnings: $59.4B

Currently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:

&gt;P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)

In their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.

Apple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.

The reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. 

Apple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple‚Äôs revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple‚Äôs revenue and earnings will drop even more.

Everyone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn‚Äôt as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it‚Äôs expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can‚Äôt see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

Another product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they‚Äôve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they‚Äôre gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [‚Äúmocked‚Äù](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.

Apple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it‚Äôs hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That‚Äôs a pretty big risk for a company that‚Äôs been bleeding cash.

And finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple‚Äôs main advantages with their software is the fact that they don‚Äôt show ads. When this changes, Apple‚Äôs software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple‚Äôs ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it‚Äôs hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he‚Äôs full of bad takes.

As Apple‚Äôs earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. 

If they don‚Äôt halt or decrease their buyback, they‚Äôll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.

tl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it.

1. The company is bought and you receive money.
2. Voting rights
3. Dividend

I purposefully don't include selling it as inherent value for a reason that I'm getting to.

So let's say your stock doesn't have voting rights or you don't care about them. The stock doesn't pay dividend AND the company is so big, that it's realistically never getting bought by another company. Or at least in its current state and a possible aqcuisition later would only happen after a huge decline in market cap.

So let's assume that there are around 3,000,000 million births in the USA in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/birth-rate-increase.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/birth-rate-increase.html).

I am using the lowest price, 7 days because babies shit, spill, lose things and piss everywhere and rounding down. Each family purchases one stroller ($120), one car seat ($100), a crib ($130), pacifier ($1 each x 7 days = $7), toys ($1-5 x 7 days = $7-35), bedding ($10-20 x 7 days = $70-140), clothing ($5-10 x 7 days = $35-70), diapers ($50 for 100 pieces x 3 = $150), bath tub ($30), towel ($5 x 7 days = $35), baby monitor ($40), baby bottles ($20), baby food/formula ($10 x 200 days = $2000) and other shit. 

120+100+130+7+35+140+70+150+30+35+40+20+2000= $2877 for one baby.

**WHY ROSEN LAW:** We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs‚Äô Bar. Many of the firm‚Äôs attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

I know some of you struggle to find motivation with your loss porn.

But owning AMD will give you a reaction stronger than viagra.

AMD beat both on top and bottom lines, achieving 8 **record quarters of revenues**, hitting $6.6bn, with yearly **growth of 70%**.

As of today, both Intel and Nvidia have **MISSED** their Q2 earnings.

**Intel**: reported their **first quarterly loss since 2017**. Investors are **horrified**, as Pat's ""rearview mirror"" statement is haunting him. Their discrete GPU (ARC) is a **FAILURE**. Their Sapphire Rapids server chip for the datacenter are a no-show, while they keep losing share to EPYC.

[EVERYTHING IS DOWN... except taxes and R&amp;D expenditures](https://preview.redd.it/t3xrfh8cvtj91.jpg?width=1774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8132dee859292de04e93d2b901068b386c54a562)

**Nvidia**: just reported revenues of to $6.7bn, a  reduction of over $1bn from initial expectations. They can't get rid of their RTX 3000 over production. Next quarter guidance is $5.9 billion a HUGE drop from the $8.3bn last quarter and **LESS THAN AMD's revenue**.

[EVERYTHING DOWN... except Operating Expenses](https://preview.redd.it/c3mfoiu6wtj91.jpg?width=1704&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afae7ccda8dc43ff271f3db33ef2943518ed92dc)

**AMD PASSED NVIDIA IN SALES THIS QUARTER**

Not only AMD's revenues up by 70% thanks to the Xilinx integration, but AMD  is also entering the telecommunications and automotive industries. AMD is the ONLY semiconductor company that reiterated its 2022 guidance, while the competition is revising downwards.

[Data Center Growth of 83&amp;#37; year over year!!!](https://preview.redd.it/qjgha03mutj91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd82832d651c07aa2fa13f7ed6ee8a45f7265c0e)

**This year belongs to AMD.**

**Breaking down AMD by markets:**

**Client:**  Consumer PC's have dropped as we head into the second half of 2022. The exceptional demand created by COVID-19 is gone, as consumers have the equipment they need. AMD expects the rest of 2022 to have a mid-teen drop in sales, but still record and better than last year's.

**Gaming:**  which includes GPUs and gaming consoles, is getting hit from the GPU  side, as demand drops from mining drops and new GPUs coming out in the next 3 months (consumers hold their purchases  before new generation launches). However, expect the drop to be offset by console chips (Xbox, Playstation, Steam Deck, Aya, etc.), which have a sales spike in Q3.

**Embedded:**  Entirely comprised of Xilinx products is a door opener for AMD, as it  will increase its offering and TAM. Expect this business to continue growing at double digits.

**Datacenter:** the jewel of the crown, growing 83% year over year, is **VERY STRONG**  and continues to take market from Intel. Genoa, Genoa-X and Bergamo  Epyc chips will continue taking market from Intel. This market is bound  to become AMD's largest business next year.

SAMSUNG, TESLA, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent... all major tech companies are buying AMD chips for their products and infrastructure.

To summarize, AMD's execution has been **ROCK SOLID**.

You now have a chance to buy the stock at double digits.... CALL NOW!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**AMD's Stock Price Target: ($120 for Q3, $150 for Q4, all time high in 2023).**

**Remember:** AMD launches Zen 4 Ryzen chips next month (September), as well as its RDNA3 Radeon High-end gaming GPUs in November, and the Genoa Epyc chips in Q4.

**This is AMD's BEST YEAR in terms of product launches.**

I expect AMD to hit its all time high in 2023, likely in the first half of the year.

It is heading to the moon, leaving the competition behind. All aboard!!!

Oh, and for the love of Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ, take your goddamn shill bots with you. Here‚Äôs some gain porn and a rundown on my main lithium plays over the last month for those of you who remember what this sub is supposed to be about.

My options plays have been primarily focused on LTHM, L.A.C., ALB, PLL, and most recently SQM. As documented on my July 26th post \[Link\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey\_retard\_take\_that\_fucking\_crayon\_out\_of\_your/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey_retard_take_that_fucking_crayon_out_of_your/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), I was holding ALB calls, LTHM calls, and L.A.C. calls at the time, along with a bunch of shares for those twice baked, long-term tendies. By closing bell on August 2nd, I was up about $12k, loving life and draggin my nuts around like I owned the place. Then, the ER for LTHM came along and gave me the ol' dick hammer and put my nuts in a vice. I lost all the options gains from the last week in minutes. Fuckin' options. But it was then, in my darkest hour of lamenting another retarded commodity play and nursing my pancake sack, that I remembered the words of my elders and bought that fuckin‚Äô dip with some more LTHM Sept expiration calls and held on for the ride. And up we rode.

August 10-12 I did some profit taking and narrowed my positions to just some L.A.C. Nov calls and my shares of course. I got off a little too early, but better to be early than never as my Uncle Randy always told me. By August 16th I felt like things were running too hot, so I picked the lithium company I liked the least (PLL), and flipped the switch with some OTM Sept puts. Sure as shit, down she went. Sold those off piece by piece over the next few days for nice 2 - 3 baggers.

Most recently, I played some SQM calls after they missed their EPS by less than 3% and tanked (almost like I learned from the LTHM ER... that's a first). Anyone with a brain that's 69% retarded or less would have seen that even though they missed, they were still up 800+ percent YOY on EPS, so this was just a great fuckin‚Äô buy opportunity. I bought Sept and Oct exp calls on the 18th after the ER crash‚Ä¶ FUCK, too early. Kept crashing. But I was sure, so balls to the wall on the 19th baby; deep discounted OTM calls for Sept, Oct, and Dec. Leveraged up, used some of that cruel mistress margin. No sleep all weekend - feelings of excitement mixed with self-doubt - Sunday night anxiety on a whole other level. Then came Monday, then came Tuesday, then \*I\* came Wednesday. Made a month's salary in just my RH account alone in less than 3 days, so like an only half-idiot investor I took some profits and am now playin the rest on house money.

Those 90p's ended up selling for almost 3x profit. I noticed my account has started to grow a bit of a following so I wanted to put out my next earning play.

Snowflake (SNOW) will release the company's Q2 FY 2023 financial results [today, after close](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/snow). Think of Snowflake stock as a proxy on the torrid growth of cloud computing giants [Amazon.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn), [Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft] and [Alphabet's Google](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl). Cloud companies continue to post above average growth but SNOW stock is down 55% in 2022. Snowflake sells data analytics and management tools that run on cloud computing platforms.

**SNOW Stock: Biggest Software IPO**

Snowflake's fiscal 2023 revenue is expected to grow 68% to $2.03 billion, decelerating from 106% growth last year. Still, at that size, Snowflake's sales growth stands out.

SNOW stock pulled off the largest initial public offering ever by a software company in September 2020. The Snowflake IPO raised $3.4 billion.

Because Snowflake's business model is consumption-based rather than subscription-based, investors have raised concerns over a possible U.S. recession curbing demand.

SNOW stock is just turning profitable on an ""adjusted"" or non-GAAP earnings basis. The company is far away from generating profit using GAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, which include stock-based compensation.

**Software Stocks Lag S&amp;P 500**

[Software growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/software-stocks-software-growth-stocks/) have clawed back somewhat as analysts debate whether the S&amp;P 500's gains since mid-June mark a bear market rally or not.

A closely watched software benchmark ‚Äî [the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV)](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/-ishares-exp-tech-sftw-igv.htm) ‚Äî is down 26% in 2022. The index has under-performed the S&amp;P 500.

Snowflake stock bulls tout its total addressable market ‚Äî potential customer base in dollars.

""With a robust top-line growth profile, NRR (net revenue retention) sustaining above 170% in recent quarters, TAM expansion  and continued margin improvements, we see a faster path to meaningful free cash flow generation as well as upside to the longer term $10 billion revenue target,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a recent note to clients.

Snowflake hosted a user conference and analyst day in Las Vegas in June. The company said new products in app development, data security and other areas will expand its TAM  to $248 billion by 2027, up from $90 billion last year.

""With its roots in data warehousing, Snowflake has rapidly expanded on all fronts to become a data cloud company,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a note.

At the user conference, the enterprise software maker reiterated its fiscal 2029 target for $10 billion in product revenue for SNOW stock. Snowflake said it expects its free cash flow margins to improve to 25% from 15%.

**Snowflake Stock: Consumption Business Model**

Most software stocks typically trade as a multiple of forward-looking revenue growth. Snowflake is not a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, company that aims to build recurring subscription revenue.

At the user event, the company addressed concern over its consumption-based revenue business model. Snowflake revenue is tied to how much data its customers crunch and store. One issue is that usage could slow during a recession.

Another issue is that customers view Snowflake as expensive if they don't control usage. Some analysts say there's less transparency and predictability than with subscription-based SaaS business model.

Snowflake in early 2022 made cloud infrastructure changes that impacted how customers are billed and slowed revenue growth.

**Synergy With Cloud Computing Giants**

In addition, SNOW stock in 2021 dropped off the [IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/?src=aurljhh#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). The Leaderboard is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.

Many companies are turning to cloud computing services as part of ""[digital transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/)"" projects that aim to gain business insights from crunching massive volumes of data. The cloud computing titans offer their own data analytics and management tools.

But the [cloud giants](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-are-spending-but-how-much/) make Snowflake's platform available to their customers. The reason is Snowflake's tools are better at some key tasks, such as letting companies compile, view, analyze and share massive amounts of data in an easy way.

Nearly two-fifths of Fortune 500 companies use Snowflake's software in the cloud as they move away from on-premise data warehousing products from [Teradata (TDC)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tdc), [Oracle (ORCL)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/orcl) and [IBM (IBM)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ibm).

**Competition Increasing**

Further, Snowflake stock hit an all-time high of 429 in early December of 2020. But SNOW stock swooned amid analyst concerns over its lofty valuation.

Whether Amazon Web Services or Google cloud ratchet up competition remains a concern for SNOW stock. Plus, competition with privately held Databricks is heating up. A recent funding round valued [Databricks at $28 billion.](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raises-1-billion-series-g-investment-at-28-billion-valuation)

Databricks, which uses [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/), is expected to launch its own IPO. [Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hpe), with its GreenLake platform, is another rival.

Two former Oracle engineers ‚Äî Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes ‚Äî along with Marcin Zukowski, former chief executive of startup Vectorwise, started Snowflake in 2012. The company holds patents in database architecture, data warehouses and other areas.

**ServiceNow Veterans Lead Company**

Snowflake stock bulls point to its seasoned management team as a strength

Snowflake brought in [Frank Slootman as CEO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-ceo-slootman-ipo-coronavirus-emergency/) in May 2019. Slootman had stepped down as CEO of ServiceNow in early 2017. Former [ServiceNow (NOW)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/now) Chief Financial Officer Mike Scarpelli in 2019 also joined Snowflake in the same CFO position.

Unlike legacy, on-premise data management systems, Snowflake's platform was built from the ground up for cloud computing. It provides 100% of its software over the internet.

Snowflake customers can share data with their partners across multiple online storage systems using the company's data warehouse. Snowflake also enables easily searchable data to be shared among applications.

Snowflake's data analytics tools became available on Amazon Web Services in 2015, Microsoft's Azure in 2018 and on Google's cloud platform in 2020.

In June 2021, Snowflake partnered with [C3.ai (AI)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ai). The two companies will cooperate in offering artificial intelligence tools to companies.

**Amazon Web Services A 'Frenemy'**

""While Snowflake is multi-cloud, it derives some 85% of its revenues from data analytics jobs deployed on Amazon Web Services, which is also Snowflake's biggest rival with AWS Redshift,"" UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said in a recent note to clients.

""This 'frenemy' relationship is critical to Snowflake's success,"" Keirstead went on to say. ""AWS benefits far more from Snowflake spending on compute and storage infrastructure resources than they lose in the form of foregone AWS Redshift revenues.""

Snowflake has focused on six core markets, including financial services, health care and life sciences, retail and consumer packaged goods, advertising media and entertainment, technology and the government sector.

When Snowflake went public in 2020 it used a dual-class share structure that gave its CEO and insiders [super-voting rights](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tech-companies-ipo-super-voting-rights/). However, Snowflake eliminated the dual-class structure in March 2021.

Snowflake had been based in San Mateo, Calif. Amid the shift to remote work spurred by the coronavirus emergency, Snowflake in May said it no longer has a corporate headquarters. It designated Bozeman, Mont., as its principal executive office, where Slootman and Scarpelli are based.

**Snowflake Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Meanwhile, Snowflake reported a loss for the April quarter that met estimates while revenue topped Wall Street targets. Guidance disappointed, sending shares down.

Snowflake reported a first quarter loss of 53 cents a share using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, compared with a loss of 70 cents per share a year earlier.

Revenue for SNOW stock jumped 85% to $422.4 million from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated Snowflake revenue at $413.7 million. Revenue climbed 101% and 110% in the two previous quarters.

The Snowflake earnings report said product revenue rose 84% to $394.4 million vs. estimates of $389 million.

For the current quarter ending in July, Snowflake said it expects product revenue of $437.5 million at the midpoint of guidance vs. analyst estimates of $436.6 million.

In addition, Snowflake said it now has 206 customers with ""trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million,"" up from 184 such customers as of Jan. 31.

**SNOW Stock Technical Analysis**

Snowflake stock went public on Sept. 16, 2020, at 120 a share. At the time, software growth stocks were hot as investors sought recurring revenue amid the coronavirus emergency.

SNOW stock popped as high as 319 on the first day of trading and closed 111.6% above the IPO price at 253.93. Shares pulled back as analysts debated Snowflake's valuation.

Snowflake stock forged a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp) over the next two months. The new base created an entry point of 301. SNOW stock blew past the buy point, hitting an all-time high of 429 on Dec. 8, 2020.

**Expectations For Snowflake's Second-Quarter Results Are Low**

As a start, it is necessary to assess the market's current expectations of SNOW's financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In my view, we have low expectations of Snowflake's Q2 FY 2023 results based on three key indicators.

The first indicator is that the sell-side's consensus estimates point to a more moderate pace of top line expansion and continued losses for Snowflake.

According to the market's consensus financial projections taken from S&amp;P Capital IQ, Wall Street expects SNOW's revenue growth to slow from +101.5% YoY in Q4 FY 2022 and +84.5% YoY in Q1 FY 2023 to +71.8% for Q2 FY 2023. Also, Snowflake is forecasted to stay in a loss-making position for Q2 FY 2023 with an estimated normalized net loss per share of -$0.01. SNOW was also unprofitable in Q1 FY 2023, but the company previously achieved positive non-GAAP adjusted earnings for both Q3 FY 2022 and Q4 FY 2022.

The second indicator is that analysts have become less optimistic about Snowflake's Q2 FY 2023 performance in recent months as seen with the revisions to SNOW's financial forecasts.

In the last three months, 24 of the 36 sell-side analysts covering Snowflake's stock have lowered their respective bottom line estimates for the company. Specifically, the sell-side's consensus bottom line projections for SNOW were cut by -11% and -20% in the past one and three months, respectively.

The third indicator is bearish sell-side commentary on the near-term prospects of SNOW.

Earlier this month there was a [BTIG research](https://research.btig.com/about/) report noting that ""a downtick in recent field checks and the fact that cloud hyperscalers started to decelerate"" had prompted a reduction in FY 2023 product revenue estimates by the analyst. Another analyst from [UBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS) also cut his or her top line forecast for fiscal 2023 on the basis that ""more customers"" are ""flagging efforts to curtail discretionary data analytics spend.""

TLDR: This stock is certainly not a buy right now and for those looking to gamble, puts would be the play. 8/26 150p is about 4.40/share, so I'll be grabbing those.","ZM died after earnings, here's my next earning play for tonight: SNOW",1.0,2022-08-24 16:20:32

1. While we know for a fact Telnyx has acquired a 6.5% stake per their latest 13G filing (just google it), the trading on this equity has been VERY sus since then.

3. The word on the street is Telnyx has partnered with an investment bank as the financing partner on the funding. Telnyx is a fast growing startup but they must be looking to take out their bigger competitor, BANDWIDTH
4. I believe their financing partner has been shorting the stock to exhaust all holders so they can buy as much as the company at a lowest possible price.  
[https://imgur.com/a/MRI92zF](https://imgur.com/a/MRI92zF) \- I've received the attached screen shot from a fellow APE with redacted names.  Apparently an investor approached Telnyx about their stake to see if they wanted to unload it.. but telnyx referenced the investor to a company called EVENTUS, which provides ""market surveilance and trade monitoring services""..  In other words, I believe they are the ones running the algo on BAND.   
5. Here is another screen shot with redacted names showing the financing partner's involvement -[https://imgur.com/a/gZ0ut7u](https://imgur.com/a/gZ0ut7u) , so.. my take is that eventus and usa advisors are working to corner this stock.

407,1661292390,ww1k8i,1,"We all saw the ""bullish"" news about BBBY adding 1500 jobs to LinkedIn today.  I looked at their corporate site and found they're actually hiring 1308 total positions between Corporate, Retail and Warehouse.  Wow, that's pretty much in line with what was posted on LinkedIn- were all those positions created today though?  Lets delve a little deeper.

BBBY careers doesn't list posting dates, so we'll take our search to Indeed.  Oh wow, they have 1,334 positions open on Indeed, so far so good.  Hmm, wait a minute, only 54 were posted today, 8 yesterday, and 10 two days ago.  That's not close to the 1500 today number.

But okay, 1500 open positions is still a lot of jobs, right?  I wonder how many stores they operate though.  According to Yahoo Finance, there is 771 Bed Bath stores in the US, so they're hiring roughly 2 people per store.  That seems about normal for retail I'd think.  But we all know most retail is hiring and currently understaffed, and they're hiring just 2 positions per store?  That seems a bit low.  But further research is needed.

Searching Google for ""Bed Bath and Beyond Competitors"" some of the most common names are: Wayfair, Kohl's, Lowes, J.C.Penney, Christmas Tree Shops, Target, Williams-Sonoma, Home Depot, Ikea, Walmart, Amazon, Macy's, and Crate and Barrel.

I'm going to throw out Wayfair (online), Lowes and Home Depot (not the same kind of store), Walmart, Target and Amazon (too big).  That leaves us with Kohl's,  J.C. Penney, Christmas Tree Shops, Williams Sonoma, Ikea, Macy's and Crate and Barrel.  

Lets see how many they're hiring:

&amp;#x200B;

|Store|Current Employees|Hiring|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Williams-Sonoma|27,000|1400|5.2%|
|Kohls|99,000|4961|5.0%|
|J.C. Penney|55,000\*|3600|6.5%|
|Christmas Tree Shops|unknown|180||
|Ikea|14,200|281|0.2%|
|Bed Bath Beyond|55,000|1308|2.4%|
|Macy's|unknown|6863||
|Crate and Barrel|7,500|607|8%|

\*The numbers were all over the place.  Most common were 50k and 60k, I settled on 55k

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so BBBY is on the lower end of positions available in relation to current employees.  But, not as bad as Ikea.  What about on a per store basis?

&amp;#x200B;

|Store|Stores|Hiring|Per Store|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Williams-Sonoma|502|1400|2.8|
|Kohls|1,156|4961|4.3|
|J.C. Penney|669|3600|5.4|
|Ikea|51|281|5.5|
|Christmas Tree Shops|80|180|2.25|
|Bed Bath Beyond|771|1308|1.7|
|Macy's|509|6863|13.5|
|Crate and Barrel|112|607|5.4|

Oh, that paints a much better picture.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, but they wouldn't be hiring if they were going bankrupt right?  Revlon entered chapter 11 protection two months ago.  They currently have roughly 5,700 employees and have 116 positions available (an increase of 2%), nearly the same ratio as Bed Bath has now.

BBBY isn't hiring because they see growth in their future, they're hiring because they need employees to staff stores if they have any hope of surviving.  They're adding fewer people per store than their competitors and are hiring a lower percent of their total workforce.  Think about how many companies are currently hiring- if you see that sign outside, they're at worst hiring .7 less people than your local Bed Bath.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's bull porn snippet from the article:

Anyway, recently filings show activist investor with twitter fingers hulking shares. August filings also show that other funds have joined the game swallowing shares with such fervor would think  they work for OnlyFans. The net effect of  so much buying is that  reduction of shares is starting to show up in  short metrics.

# Today‚Äôs filing [[link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000089924322029450/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)]

Dude named King Theodore Walker Cheng-De ( *the activist investor*)  spammed the buy button on Avaya and is now a 15%+ holder. What‚Äôs cool about this is that the [original](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522224146/d358952dsc13g.htm) 13g disclosed that he owned 11,432,250 as of Aug 8th. A few weeks later he decides to double dip and get around 1.8m more shares so now he owns 13,231,350 shares . Nice now he owns 15.4% of shares outstanding.

From the 13f quarterly‚Äôs (as of 2022-08-09 and 8/15): ( [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya))

* MARINER INVESTMENT GROUP LLC: increased stake by 17,500,000 shares now holds 22,140,000 shares. = 25.7% of shares

* [PHILOSOPHY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/philosophy-capital-management-llc): opened position to the tune of 7,465,000 shares = 8.6% of shares
* [ALTA FUNDAMENTAL ADVISERS LLC](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/alta-fundamental-advisers-llc): opened position to the tune of 7,250,000 shares = 8.5% of shares

Not going to keep going but just showing that other funds have been ape‚Äôing into shares of Avaya as recently as last week.

So, we have a stock thats -98% from its 2021 high with a recent vocal activist investor, we have multiple funds ape'ing to Avaya this month, and new CEO and new management. If AVAYA pays off 2.25% 2023 convertible note with the  $221 million in escrow, or if they release a 8k regarding a turnaround plan, or if more filings come out showing that even more tutes are loading it should fly.

&amp;#x200B;

You may notice that Avaya market gap is 60million, yet they have $404million of cash on hand, and $221m cash in escrow. They also authorized 147m of buybacks.

&amp;#x200B;

Again they have a 60million market cap, can see that in 2019 there were talks to spinoff a part of Avaya business for 4billion.

# Why the move today?

(1) The interview with the CEO? (2) Theodore King bought more shares (3) Theodore released a letter 5page letter about Avaya.

Can view Theo‚Äôs letter here direct here in the 13g filing: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm)

You can read his thesis for why he‚Äôs spamming Avaya aggressively for millions and selling puts. His letter is  instructive, and a better summation than my smoothed brain can manage. If you skim through you‚Äôll see Theo has a PT of $25.

Want more bull porn? Ok fine below see JP Morgan reiterating  $7 PT last week.

That‚Äôs about it. That‚Äôs the setup. Avaya's software is very prevalent btw basically every company uses them.

# Hold up wait need the squeeze weather forecast:

Can see above that juicy setup, CTB/ON-LOAN/UTLIZATION increasing, while on-loan avg age is decreasing to flat. So I interpret this as shares being sucked from float making the short metrics rise. In fact, we know that total shares outstanding 85,836,560. If we add up all the shares 6 funds mentioned earlier own we get 66.34m shares, all loaded I'm guessing in the last two months. So that's around 77% of shares outstanding locked up recently, and we can see the effects on Ortex.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/60ljsjynyij91.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fec358aed8a024f8187e2a5a2da05a86941abfb

&amp;#x200B;

Checking the price and volume can see volume increasing, rsi getting a bit of legs, but more importantly can see we are at the absolutely ground floor, even with Avaya impressive performance on an absolute puke day for the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Wrapping things up SI is 20% of float since 15m shares are sold short . Given  that Avaya has 85,836,560 shares outstanding and if we add the 6 funds mentioned early stakes we come to 66.34m shares locked up recently  by tutes. So, let's do some math for the float: 85.8m-66.34m = 19.46m. I only did this quickly and roughly there are other holders if you want you can go to [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) yourself and calculate. ***However, given this info can reasonable say that the entire float is close to shorted, and kinda of explains the increase in short metrics while the average age of loans is flat - tutes sucking shares away.***

So to recap the activist investor Theo is active on Twitter (always a plus) check the language below to see why this is good.

About : Bandwidth is a leading enterprise cloud communications company. Companies like Cisco, Google, Microsoft, RingCentral, Uber, and Zoom use Bandwidth's APIs to easily embed voice, messaging and emergency services into software and applications. Bandwidth is the first and only CPaaS provider offering a robust selection of communications APIs built around their own IP voice network.

Thesis :

1. $1.17mm in insider purchases over the last 4 months.
2. Privately held competitor named Telnyx recently took a 6.5% stake. Privately held competitors don't just buy a stake for equity appreciation, they buy for a hostile takeover / tender offer
3. SI is around 15%
4. Insiders own over 10%
5. Cash on hand : $300mm
6. Trading at less than 1x sales, while most enterprise software fetches 5-7x sales!
7. Institutions own 94.8% of the float
8. Low float - only 25mm shares
9. Recently crushed earnings, maintained revenue guidance (which was raised in the prior quarter)
10. IPO'd in 2017 at $20/share, traded around $80 BEFORE the pandemic, then hit $175 during the pandemic pump, now is back down to $19/share.
11. Despite trading below it's IPO price from 2017, the company has quadrupled revenues
12. This is not some 2020 spac, ark complex, pump and dump. It's a small cap tech company that is being overlooked by the market.
13. Company was founded in 1999
14. 21-22 is an area of resistance, above that is a black hole back to $70. They are doing everything they can to keep it below 21-22.
15. If we can break $19.66 today, next stop is $20.70.
16. Stock has triple bottomed at $15 and has made multiple attempts to break $21-$22, I believe the next ramp up we blow through it.

Potential Conspiracy Theory

1. While we know for a fact Telnyx has acquired a 6.5% stake per their latest 13G filing (just google it), the trading on this equity has been VERY sus since then.
2. They must disclose any buys/sells and since the latest 13G there have been none. They don't have to disclose short positions
3. The word on the street is Telnyx has partnered with an investment bank as the financing partner on the funding. Telnyx is a fast growing startup but they must be looking to take out their bigger competitor, BANDWIDTH
4. I believe their financing partner has been shorting the stock to exhaust all holders so they can buy as much as the company at a lowest possible price.
5. If we degens take ownership before they do, we are going to have to make them pay much higher prices for Bandwidth shares and/or make them cover at much higher prices.
6. My claim that they could be shorting is just a theory, but I think it makes sense. I've been following the ticker very closely and in my experience there is someone short that is trying to corner the stock

The stock has triple bottomed at $15 and is looking to make a major break above $21. When it does there is a massive vacuum back to $70s. There is ZERO reason this company should be trading below where it traded before the pandemic.

I understand the pandemic pump was unsustainable but most of these tech companies returned to prepandemic valuations. In this stock it would be in the $70s-$80s, but it's trading at $17 while the fundamentals have been extremely resilient.

413,1661223951,wvdhs5,1,"Hello regards, I have been looking at some short squeeze plays for the last while and found this beauty of a gem.

AVYA has fallen 96.14% over the past year due to decreasing revenues and increasing chances of bankruptcy. Former CEO Jim Chirico has been ousted as a result, and in comes Alan Masarek who was the CEO of Vonage Holdings.

Looking at Masarek's tenure at Vonage, he joined as CEO in November 2014, the share price of Vonage was $3.51. He voluntarily stepped down in July 2020, when the share price was around $10, so we know Masarek is capable of helping a company perform well. He also was the co-founder of Quickoffice, which was **acquired** by Google in June 2012. Judging by this, he has experience with companies being acquired, which is great for one of the points later in the post.

&amp;#x200B;

[Around a 200&amp;#37; increase in Vonage Holding's value when Masarek was CEO.](https://preview.redd.it/ecq4cwwsodj91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddad82c7506313aa627c79204d150735024374e9)

&amp;#x200B;

Enough about the CEO, let's talk about the current situation Avaya faces. Q3/22 preliminary results were announced and showed a 20% YoY decrease in revenue which was substantially less than what was projected. Original guidance was $685M - $700M in revenue, but it is projected to be $575M - $580M. EBIDTA was also lower than expected; from $140M - $150M to $50M - $55M.

They also issued a statement regarding their ability to continue as a company. Convertible notes due 2023, along with their surprising revenue drop, puts Avaya in a bad place in regards to their heavy debt load.

""So how can they turn the company back around?""  you might be asking.  Avaya OneCloud, a service Avaya offers, is growing at 21% QoQ and 118% YoY according to their last earnings report (Q2/22). OneCloud generated $750M in Annual Recurring Revenue as of Q2 and will probably see even more growth once Q3 earnings are released. This is the primary driver of growth in the company. The company anticipated that it would hit $1B ARR by the end of 2022. They also announced that they would start to cut costs aggressively in order to put themselves on the path to profitability.

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""The Company has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/fw94ojbvodj91.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=285c7e28e94998aeaa2c74f67646c3cb2126c770)

Avaya have also not submitted their 10-Q report (for Q3/22) on time due to an internal investigation, prompting the NYSE to issue a delisting notice.

These problems have caused the stock to drop 70% in a matter of days.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there is hope. Avaya stock has been shorted very heavily over the past while. Currently, according to Fintel, their short interest as a % to float is 20.32% (as of August 22). 20% SI% is considered really high. Off-Exchange Short Volume Ratio is also very high at 49.57%. This is volume that is traded off public exchanges in dark pools. Regardless of public or private trading, short interest is really high. AVYA is a great short squeeze candidate **if** people start to buy shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[20.32&amp;#37; Short Interest as a &amp;#37; of Float and Off-Exchange Short Volume Ratio of 49.57&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/9ua2inf3pdj91.png?width=1230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db6659d9423cf32e693f4a95715ac622e33da9b0)

&amp;#x200B;

Another caveat to consider is the value of the company. The current market cap as of August 22, 2022 is $70M. That's **extremely** low, especially for a company that does $3B in revenue. Even one quarter of EBITDA is almost as much as Avaya's entire market cap. This tells me that the company is severely undervalued and is primed for a correction to the upside. Another thing that could help is the low stock price. At $0.80, it is appealing to any investor and could lead to many people buying shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[Up 31&amp;#37; since business update about substantial doubt to continue.](https://preview.redd.it/uhcn25wbpdj91.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13097ac5092005b6c38c87d5709482085fd25752)

The price has gone up 31% since dropping on August 9th due to its terrible preliminary financial results and claim that the company has substantial doubt to continue operating. If the stock continues to go up, this could cause shorts to cover, propelling the price further up.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0b8ntrcfpdj91.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d4210cf75bf567a8680393389c254465c33126

As we can see here, AVYA is down 95% since IPO and 97% from ATH. This gives us a lot of room to go up in the event of a short squeeze. Also we must remember that Avaya is a big player in the communications space, so this isn't another shitty penny stock company. This is a company that has a long history, a reputable brand, and many customers.

&amp;#x200B;

On that last point, one last thing is that Avaya could be a great buyout candidate due to its vast customer base. According to them, they server over 100k customers in 190 countries. Some big customers they serve include **American Express**, **Apple**, **Barclays**, **Bank of America**, **Citigroup**, **CVS**, **GE**, **General Motors**, **MetLife**, **UPS**, and **Walmart**. Seeing this customer base should make a lot of companies think about buying them out, especially since they are at an attractive valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

[Avaya has a huge customer base located all around the world.](https://preview.redd.it/u589muegpdj91.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54751a62ff9e2aee85fc09c0d3dd76ea7f24baa9)

&amp;#x200B;

The future is promising for Avaya, especially since they have a new, reputable CEO that is capable of turning this ship around. Best case is that Avaya returns to double digits in share price and in return, provide value to us shareholders. Another great case is that Avaya gets bought out by a company looking to expand their reach in terms of customer base. Worst case scenario, the company goes bankrupt, but even then it wouldn't necessarily be over for the company.

One more thing, we can track retail activity by using Google Trends. In the past 12 months, search results for NYSE: AVYA are at their highs.

&amp;#x200B;

[Rapidly increasing search volume for AVYA.](https://preview.redd.it/jw9fgwdipdj91.png?width=1423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a5b161f1105bb273cee6f537cae17039f921ba)

It's great to see that more and more people are searching up the stock. It indicates that the stock is gaining momentum in regards to interest in it.

&amp;#x200B;

There is my analysis of $AVYA. Usually, since I'm a lazy regard, I let other people do my DD for me. But since Avaya is still under the radar, I decided to do and publish my DD for this company and stock purely based on its current situation which had me really intrigued. This is my first analysis of any company, so I hope you enjoyed it!

**Disclaimer :**

Apologies beforehand for a lot of verbose because of the final newsletter. For quick read up i suggest reading ""Tl;dr section"" ( headings ) and for the reasons behind it are included in the detailed ""Experiment section"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro:**

&amp;#x200B;

    ‚ÄúI felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices slowly and wildly got together and then there was an uprising against the government and the financial institutions‚Äù
    

Sorry guys, I was supposed to send this the day before yesterday ( great movie ) but unfortunately I got caught up in a celebration we are having over here.

So it's the start of the weekend. Y‚Äôall know what that means. I'm not talking about having a party lol, that is for me. You guys have to decipher this long post so that you can protect yourself from the upcoming danger that I am seeing. In short you‚Äôre fucked if you don‚Äôt read this especially institutions and hedge funds. Just for this week please avoid strip clubs. This one's for you guys because you read my post. ( I like to think so )

Retail public especially retards i don‚Äôt have words for you guys. You guys can chill this weekend because all you do is sh9t on my post. Might as well sh9t on this too. I don‚Äôt care since all you‚Äôre obsessed with is Ryan Cohen and $BBBY. So when you‚Äôre finally over him after getting drunk this weekend then you can go ahead and read this post. Could be worth your time.

&amp;#x200B;

As for people asking me why I don't give my opinions regarding meme stocks. Well folks the reason is simple. We are still in a bear market according to my calculations. So it's written somewhere in the gospel of investing that bear markets are the opportunities to analyze value companies, not meme companies which are about to be purge in the upcoming mega crash as an offering to please the gods of stock market.

Yes you ‚ÄúYou-tube‚Äù folks the crash hasn‚Äôt even started yet. We still have -53% to go from here till March 2023 as my base case. Don't even ask me about my worst case. For that just open the Dow Jones 1929-1932 chart.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr and Td;du folks : ( Too long didn't read, Too dumb didn‚Äôt understand )**

We have already discussed this : Buy 4 months/2 months/1 months puts i.e Dec 30/Oct 29/Sept 29 at the money with strike price near about ""200 day moving average = 200dMA"" in $SPY last week of august if it comes. 

It already did one time on August 16 and i think the top is already in. So you‚Äôre gonna profit regardless.

Invalidation would be three white soldier candles above 200dMA of course in daily chart. For positions go scroll down. ( I will make you work for it at-least. xD )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now for those folks who want a detailed explanation about everything let‚Äôs dive in.

**Respected Traders and Investors,**

&amp;#x200B;

How are you guys doing? It‚Äôs been a long time hasn‚Äôt it. God I was gone for a while and had Ni-san use my Reddit account for a few days. First of all, I'm gonna apologize for the Shzio post by my brother Itachi. Man, it felt like it messed up my brains for a while there. It was so damn trippy.  So I highly highly advise you guys not to go and read it a second time. Please, it's for your own health. 

Regardless i love my brother analysis coz he thinks like no other normal people do in the world of trading/investing. So, I take full responsibility for my actions and if things don't go as planned out in the above charts ( i.e the mega crash doesn‚Äôt happen you know ) then you‚Äôre not gonna hear from us.

P.s. We promised you that we will do these posts only in bear markets. Even if the USA goes into depression for 10 to 15 years we will post in a week or two until we visit ath ( all time high ) once again. One may ask why not do this stuff in the bull market? Guys you have to understand we are not bull market specialists. For bull markets it's generally advised to follow moon boys on twitter, tik-tok, You-tube etc. They are more educated and well informed than us in that department with a huge audience behind them. ( They spend so much on marketing lol )

&amp;#x200B;

**Recap : Predictions 2022 so far.**

I don‚Äôt usually like to do this because my readers already know about this but it‚Äôs time to back-test how accurate we ( i.e. me and my brother ) have been this whole time especially to show random people who are new to reading these kinds of posts especially when it‚Äôs season finale.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* We predicted the March 16 post Fomc rally.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6n7xv1xs52j91.png?width=1851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef518b9218d0bc29d830fc61927009ece8a66438

* We predicted the April top. Thought it was gonna last two to three days more but it lasted just one.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ictvxtex52j91.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1905d15b9028016b853e12dd817097c285d2eac7

* Then we predicted June Fomc bottom which we already mentioned in our first letter. Does ‚ÄúDante cash deployment $SPX $3600-3700 at trend based 1 fib‚Äù ring a bell. ( But then later i said to just sell above 2% because Cpi 8.8% est and Atlanta Fed Gdp -2.1% est scared the sh9t out of me and i changed my strategy from ""Riding to the top of the Bear market rally"" to ""Shorting at the top of bear market rally"" )

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/brojy4p462j91.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a96db2532fe7643a3b03e3f2293102e8c28a06e2

* And now we finally did the same for August top at 15/16 i.e. 200dMA/ 50-61.8% fib retrace which is just a follow up to above June Fomc bottom. post.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/da60ccei62j91.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9e342a4a1f31b7ed9cd4931c8511bdd9368ae5

&amp;#x200B;

And then there were bond, commodity, Dxy calls that we are not even mentioning.

What this all means is that the stock markets have been performing as we had hoped for since February which is like 6-7 months ago. So i guess we are not a broken clock and actually do provide the exact days or should i say the time horizon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Am I a member of secret society i.e. ""Illuminati‚Äù or have contacts in ""Pay pal mafia"" ?**

No guys. I am not a member of secret society nor do i have any contacts. My brother do though. I do want to manage the portfolio of wealthy clients like my brother someday but I'm too lazy. I just want to take bets and watch anime and Tv shows my entire life. I just finished West world and now i guess i will watch episode 1 of ‚ÄúHouse of dragons‚Äù. ( Why did that producer said bad things about Emilia. Hmm ) As for anime recommendation man its getting hard to find good ones. I'm just waiting for Chainsaw man now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**About my self.**

Before all of this I was a Computer Science student whose only good skill was learning a hybrid application development platform called Flutter ( By Google ) but now I just write detailed and boring posts on Wall Street bets about anything that comes to my mind for you guys. My predictions come right because of you folks so thank you for taking trades and also I just basically copy pasted 2008 charts ( 32nd death week ) like I do with Git-hub while programming.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Now will I be wrong in the future?**

Of course I will be. I‚Äôm no economist. I just make cases i.e stock market = 1972-73 or 2008 and just bet on them. Also a big hedge fund guy might find my post someday and take the opposite trade against me wrecking people who followed my advice.

Hence i always tell you guys ‚ÄúDo your own research‚Äú ‚ÄúThis is not financial advice‚Äù even though it will be right most of the time. You absolutely should not follow anybody w/o checking out at-least 10 other guys.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why take my advice ?**

So now that we have cleared some of the confusion which I couldn't in my Wsb guest talk appearance you might be thinking why we should even consider your advice in the top 10 folks we watch. You‚Äôre a nobody. Well folks in my defense i would say it's because I gradually improved myself. Earlier my posts were shitty but now they are getting better especially my T.A. And I'm also learning economics day by day. Do you know guys I didn't wanted to write this as final post coz I was actually busy working on other post like ‚ÄúDeciphering Stagflation 70's‚Äù and ‚ÄúThermodynamics in Economics‚Äù as my farewell post. Yes it's true guys the US economy is one giant open system. That‚Äôs how Elon Musk and Jerome Powell do calculations about economics. xD

Well enough spoilers about the next season. I know you guys are getting bored. So lets now finally jump in what i wanted to actually talk about. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Experiment :**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Deriving conclusions about Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 and rest other asset classes using other asset classes on weekly and monthly charts. I know it sounds insane right now but you will see. So just trust me on this. (My grammar is so poor)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Tools :**‚Äù

I mean the Technicals i will be using today includes :

\-&gt; Candle sticks

\-&gt; Elliot wave with Fibonacci

\-&gt; Stochastic Rsi

\-&gt; My favorite which never ever lies : Pvt(O)

\-&gt; At last my ‚ÄúKetlner channels‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Procedure :**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 1 : Forex Markets

&amp;#x200B;

[Eur-usd](https://preview.redd.it/848syozq72j91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14cb27fe26c6818e1afbf67de147c95d735240d)

&amp;#x200B;

**Eur-usd :** Have you ever seen such a bearish chart in your life both on a weekly and monthly basis? I mean as much as I love European countries but I have to say your Eur-usd charts sucks equally much. Putin owns you guys this winter. Italy and Germany are already suffering so much with 10x bills gas + electricity if compared with 2021 so i can't even imagine about countries like Spain, Greece etc. Okay so I'm gonna stop myself now with the pessimism and dive into Technicals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Eur-usd bull traders have to stop this deadly weekly close otherwise the whole world is f‚Äôed.
* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.924.
* Stochastic RSI are about to cross weekly and go down.
* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over.‚Äô
* We aren‚Äôt even testing the Ketlner red upper band. That‚Äôs how bearish we are.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Eur-usd bull traders couldn't stop monthly support i.e 1.03. Rejected it, retested it from below and rejected it again. The double top at 1.24 was deadly too coz you know when we break the support at 1.03 you go down equally much. Hence those red vertical lines.
* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.81487 so is 0.834 vertical red line support.
* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain't coming out of there any time soon before weekly readjusts.
* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat for a while.
* We are hanging on the Ketlner upper red band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say with 1000% certainty that  Eur-usd is going down. Thank you madam Lagarde. You‚Äôre doing such a fine job by selling German Bund and buying Italian bonds. Congratulations to you and your PEP tool (Lol, guys this woman is bat-sh9t crazy)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Gbp-usd](https://preview.redd.it/yh25km1x72j91.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69b5b05bc7239d7a39983d46014631a715cbac77)

&amp;#x200B;

**Gbp-usd :** Well first Sir Mr Bailey. I have to say I'm a big fan of your honesty if you are reading this. I mean in today's world it's hard to find someone that honest in a government job. So guys we know inflation is double digit‚Äôs over here ( heading to 13% or was it 15% in coming months ) and in September the Bank of England is going with 50 bps. So we already know that Uk is gonna have more than 2Q of -ve Gdp. I hope you Uk folks survive considering you're gonna lose jobs, probably go into economic depression because recession is everybody‚Äôs base case even of Mr Bailey. So enough details let‚Äôs do analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Gbp-usd is in a huge IHS pattern but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will go to the upside that easily. Currently the price is testing right shoulder at 1.19. If it breaks then the price will test the head 1.14 and if it doesn‚Äôt break and holds then the price will go to 1.42 to test the neckline. After that we shall see whether the IHS breaks or not. Also the volume is supporting the down move.
* There is no Elliot wave here. But the key thing to note is that if 1.14 breaks then you‚Äôre heading to 0.87 levels. Reason being two vertical red lines should be equal.
* Stochastic RSI has crossed weekly and is about to go down.
* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over. If it doesn‚Äôt break only then you have a chance of at-least going to the neckline.
* The price action has occupied the whole Ketlner red band. Meaning we are in a bearish downtrend.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Just remember we are in the box lock of 1.14 to 1.42 range. The increasing volume is also supporting this downwards move. If i don't take any wicks into consideration then it looks like the price has broken 61.8% fib and would likely head downwards to 1 fib cause there is no support of candle closing. So watch out for monthly close here as well and an eye on higher high volume.  Also don't forget those red vertical lines. 1.72 - 1.42 , 1.42 - 1.14, so 1.14 - XXX. Do the math.
* 12345 was completed in Oct 2007 ( Yah that old ) From then we are in the ABC corrective wave. Elliot wave C is still deciding what‚Äôs gonna happen with IHS. If it breaks down you‚Äôre looking at 0.95.
* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain't coming out of here any time soon.
* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat.
* We are hanging on the Ketlner red upper band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say Gbp-usd is going down. Mr Soros if you‚Äôre listening to this, let's break the ‚ÄúBank of England‚Äù once again. Just for good old times sake.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Usd-Jpy](https://preview.redd.it/onbs70bf82j91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac73e6bdb79823496a0f762e30e2fb467f38af61)

&amp;#x200B;

**Usd-jpy :** If i tell you anything about this forex pair I‚Äôm probably Bs‚Äôing you. It‚Äôs true guys. Even Mr Kuruda the governor of Boj doesn‚Äôt know where the Usd-jpy is gonna go. But what we can speculate is if the dollar becomes so much stronger due to the weakness in the Eur-usd equation then Dxy is gonna pump past 110 and the dollar becomes stronger. Got it. So I could easily play this approach into my thesis by telling you yes this pair is just gonna go up. But I will not do that. Instead I'm gonna play a devil‚Äôs advocate here saying Usd-jpy will go down. So let‚Äôs analyze things which are a total waste of your and my time because I'm gonna reverse this forex you will see how.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Traders watch the 136. It‚Äôs a critical resistance. A clean break of it would mean 148 otherwise we go 125.
* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 and now we go for the ABC corrective wave. A will hit you at 116 and the rest is just a made up wave.
* Stochastic RSI is on bottom and will go up.
* Pvt(O) too looks like it could go up.
* Here in this Ketlner channel we are hanging on a lower green band. That‚Äôs how bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Traders watch the monthly close. If it closes above 136 we go to 148 otherwise down.
* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 wave. Entire ABC is made up because it all depends on the monthly close.
* Stochastic RSI is on top flying and looks overbought but who can argue with their unlimited bond buying which in turn has caused the parabolic move.
* Pvt(O) too looks like it could touch the blue line. If it crosses we fall, if not we go up.
* Here in this Ketlner channel we are on an upper green band. That‚Äôs how extremely bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.

&amp;#x200B;

So since I took the bear case it doesn't look like any bearish to me. Don't you agree? So our devil in devil‚Äôs advocate looks weak. So to fit our thesis lets reverse this. This is kinda like physics or Math kind of stuff where we proof things by assuming inverse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say but I will say Jpy-usd is going up to 148 at my favorite dot com times where Dxy went 120. Hence i‚Äôm selling my Yen trust with ticker $FXY.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 2 : DXY. A basket of forex currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

You must be wondering, I'm gonna introduce another colorful RGB crayon drawing chart on both weekly and monthly. Sorry to disappoint you folks but I'm not doing that. Instead let‚Äôs use our brains.

We know that US dollar Index i.e. Dxy is used to measure the value of the dollar a/g basket of 6 currencies. The Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, British pound and Swedish krona. Now I'm not gonna explain you here why dollar is global reserve currency or dollar has more liquidity so let‚Äôs just assume that.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens now is when Eur-usd becomes weaker, investors usually go risk off and buy the safest asset in the world i.e Dollar. Hence the Dxy goes stronger which suggests the dollar is getting stronger coz european buddies will exchange for dollars coz its very liquid and due to interest rate differentials. ( Remember Gbp-usd is an exception to interest rate differential coz what's happening over there is interest rates will go up but their currency is still losing its strength )  

&amp;#x200B;

We have discussed a thesis in past letters already and came to a conclusion and I quote.

‚ÄúEur-usd is a mirror image of the Dxy chart.‚Äù Remember this for your lifetime. Especially you Gen-z.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn‚Äôt gonna post a chart but then I realized I should for new folks who are lazy to read past posts. Eur-usd breaks parity and goes 0.80 levels Dxy will be 120 for sure. In monthly Dxy is super bullish. And on a weekly basis it's trying to close above 107 i believe. Hence your Voldemort asset class dropped -8% i guess. Right ?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Mirror chart : DXY vs Eur-usd](https://preview.redd.it/pphup5l792j91.png?width=1637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a182585c747ec04f6078572bd4dab7091d12f81)

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say Dollar or  DXY is getting stronger in comparison to Euro, Gbp and Jpy. Hence DXY to 120 is back on the table according to the ‚Äú20yrs of wyckoff accumulation‚Äù pattern. If you cleanly break 110-112 i must say equities especially the Spx is gonna visit to my $3200 level.**

**Now some Cnbc or Bloomberg guys who stole my research and didn‚Äôt gave me credit 2-3 months ago used to come on tv and say things like ‚ÄúOh in 2018 Spx visited 200wMA so it makes sense that this cycle which is even more tightening compared to last makes sense to visit this range.‚Äù**

**So folks now the Spx has shifted its 200wMA/50mMA = $3500-$3600. But these clowns oops economists don't know that we should take a look at the monthly chart. Once you open that. Your pants are about to drop coz in the last tightening we visited not 200wMA but 100 monthly moving average i.e 100mMA. Yeah let‚Äôs go visit makachev vs oliviera in oct 23rd ufc 280. So if we cross paths over there I will tell you we are going to Spx $2873 i.e. somewhere around $2800-2900 which my close friend Dr Burry suggested too. Hence he sold + he is shorting coz he has relieved every moment in 2008. So he knows what‚Äôs coming next. You guys don‚Äôt.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 3 :Eur-usd  Implied Fed funds 100-CME:GEZ2023 ( Not gonna use Elliot wave + Fib trend starting here now )

&amp;#x200B;

This is like gonna be super high level stuff even far above my pay grade. Only Zoltan can explain this using repo markets but since he is busy I will try to explain it in a funny way. So if you might have watched Cnbc this past week two economists were arguing about how Fed funds have priced in 4% already but one might be saying no it has only priced in 3.4-3.5%. So who is right?

&amp;#x200B;

If you watch ‚ÄúEverything money‚Äù by my suggestion then Mo came to the conclusion that the reason he is saying 4% is because the Fed is doing QT + rate hikes which Mo still does not believe.

&amp;#x200B;

So who is right and what is the right explanation for 4% ?

Imo they both are right but the explanation is wrong. The reason one should present about the 4% Fed funds argument is that in Eur-usd implied Fed funds went to 4%. Hence the market has priced 4% in the euro dollar banking system. But if you take only the dollar banking system in Usa then we look at yields of 2 yr and 10 yr which are hinting that Fed funds 3.4-3.5% is already priced in by the markets.

&amp;#x200B;

[Eur-usd implied Fed funds.](https://preview.redd.it/1e44kz7n92j91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed1184c16108f660d104edbd1ceac6e0b786f46)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly and weekly time frame analysis :

* Both look strong on a monthly and weekly basis. If monthly candle closes above resistance i.e. 3.50 this month then we are looking past 4% Eur-usd implied fed funds
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly and crossed and is heading up while on monthly they are about to cross and hover above for a while.
* Pvt(O) on weekly looks promising as compared to monthly.
* Both of them don‚Äôt wanna lose their lower green Ketlner band.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say that we are going up here technically. So J. Powell, could you please back me up on this. Zoltan agrees with me. Snyder doesn‚Äôt.** 

**( Just remember implied fed funds can go up due to Eur-usd weakness. So its kinda like indirect interest rate hike for markets. Add QT on top of that. Hence Fed is dovish in Fomc minutes for rate hikes )**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 4 : HYG &amp; LQD : The corporate bonds

&amp;#x200B;

[HYG](https://preview.redd.it/xwav70t8a2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b03c2b697eaabdb09728007e8699c1f158e40810)

&amp;#x200B;

Hyg : This product is designed to replicate a benchmark which provides a broad representation of the U.S. dollar-denominated high yield liquid corporate bond market. The high yield bond space has been cracked wide open by ETFs, as these products have offered numerous ways for investors to take advantage of this space. High yields can be a great addition to a yield-starved portfolio, as they can offer yields into the double digits for those willing to take on the risks that come along with it. The high returns come from riskier bond choices who have to pay out higher ratios to compensate investors for high risks. This means that the holdings of these ETFs will have higher chances of defaults, and could potentially leave investors out to dry. But those who have done their homework on the holdings of a particular ‚Äújunk‚Äù bond fund have the ability to generate strong returns from these powerful products. HYG keeps most of its assets inside of the U.S., though it does offer a slice of international exposure as well. The ETF is dominated by corporate bonds, the majority of which have investment grades between B and BB. This product will make a great income addition to any investor who is fully aware of the risks a high yield bond product carries.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* Weekly is gonna print bearish engulfing candle. Also there is a volume divergence. Price going up but volume going down which leads to fall. Trend line break candles will be the nail on the coffin.
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading down.
* Pvt(O) on weekly is also done after releasing supply and now will head down to accumulation..
* Ketlner middle line changing band rejected the price action suggesting bearish continuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly time frame analysis :

* Monthly rejected its previous to previous top of the candle and is gonna print another st. down red monthly. Again price ascending volume declining.
* But interestingly stochastic Rsi on monthly going up..
* Pvt(O) on monthly also about to cross its blue line later sometimes.
* As for Ketlner, well it's pretty much occupying the entire red lower band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

LQD : I leave it up to you guys. Cmon at least do one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going down on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going down because of that deadly candle that folks have been talking about.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 5 : IEI/HYG : Government bond price / Corporate bond price.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[IEI\/HYG : Double check below thing.](https://preview.redd.it/i3bbj0fda2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36056c59d1b790618d5af8006a9bafec16ea7884)

&amp;#x200B;

IEI/HYG : If it goes up then credit spreads are widening. ( Bad thing i.e risk off )

IEI/HYG : If it goes down then credit spreads are tightening. ( Good thing i.e. risk on )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* Weekly is about to print a bullish engulfing candle. Also volume isn‚Äôt supporting downwards move i.e. price is going down but volume is going down as well.
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading up.
* Can't comment about Pvt(O) weekly. Mixed signals
* Ketlner middle line changing band supported the price action and is green. Meaning bullish continuation

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly time frame analysis :

* No complete data on monthly that we can make assumptions.
* But stochastic Rsi crossed on monthly and suggested going down.
* Pvt(O) flat.
* As for Ketlner, well we had rejection from an extremely bullish green band i.e. we haven't gotten permission for capitulation but we got support from middle Ketlner to make the price go up again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going up on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going up.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 6 : ( Super scary ) : Velocity of m2 or m1 money supply i.e v = us gdp / m1 or m2.

&amp;#x200B;

[Velocity of M2](https://preview.redd.it/63y690uka2j91.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=259b9d0855aacf6aae7f97a74591f5408b1ad7da)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very debatable topic. Only the pros have the right to argue about this stuff and no one else. Peter lynch once told me during my time travel visit that people worry that the velocity of money supply is going up way too fast then we are gonna have depression and if the velocity of money supply goes down then too we are gonna have depression. So which one is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways Q3 2020 : 1.149 was the highest reading. Currently we are trying to break it. Q2 2022 : 1.147

&amp;#x200B;

""The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. This is called an expanding economy."" \~ By Fred website.

&amp;#x200B;

So go out there and ask your banking friends and tell them please explain the concept of money supply in today's terms. Not an old term. So I too went to my brother for advice. He told me ‚Äú F off ‚Äú

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : ‚ÄúF off‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 7 : Gold

&amp;#x200B;

We are not gonna do weekly and monthly time frame analysis on this. Some of you guys may be like ‚ÄúDude, I'm an old man with agricultural land. I wanna own gold like my ancestors from 18th century coz i believe in stagflation, parabolic move, end of the world, negative debasement hedge blah blah‚Äù So i need charts.

**Old man's Gold :**

Old man you need to chill. We are gonna use our brain like Peter Schiff. So we know, gold doesn't love that his nemesis dollar is going up. Now if you can tell me how high Dxy will go up then i can tell you that the top of Dxy will be the bottom of Gold. Also gold doesn‚Äôt love financial crisis or bank runs. In my world gold is a phoenix who rises from ashes. Meaning if we plunge into the abyss then gold is gonna drag us out of there first. Then indices move and other asset classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Digital Gold :**

As for young folks, you love the King of Voldemort asset class don‚Äôt you? So go buy it at amazon bottom i.e. $4-5k or my favorite Richard heart level -83% i.e 10,690. Or if you really don't have the patience like probably 99% of the entire world population you buy some % of this commodity for whatever reasons these guys are selling you at $20k. I shall rest my case now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Gold down and vice versa.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 8 : TLT/JNK : It‚Äôs kinda like IEI/HYG

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys do this please? 

Hint : Bullish divergence on weekly and monthly. Meaning TLT ( 20yr treasury bond etf by black rock ) buying over Junk bonds i.e. JNK

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 9 : US Oil.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go Brandon and the government. Just how much are you gonna manipulate the best inflation hedge alive. You guys have already killed my Gold. Yes you J.P. Morgan traders, I hate you. May your bank dies in upcoming crash and have Panic of 2023 just like  Knickbocker crisis in 1907. Only then I shall have my vengeance a/g those rumors you circulated back in the days.

So guys you probably would know this that our Usa Government try to manipulate oil market just to please people and ask for votes. These are some of their stupid tactics.

&amp;#x200B;

* Releasing SPR ( i.e. Strategic petroleum reserve ) in the market.
* Pressurizing Saudis to find oil. ( Btw Saudi Armaco alone made profits greater than all Usa mega cap tech combined )
* Windfall taxes on Oil companies.
* Distributing E.V. credits to people. But even E.V. companies are smart. They instead increase their price. Ford I mean what the f you guys are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the most manipulated market I have ever seen in my 100 yr+ of lifetime. So traders if your conclusion from my above observation was that we should short Oil lemme tell you something in double quotes.

‚ÄúBe afraid of Putin‚Äôs Winter Oil boogeyman‚Äù. ""Contango is a dangerous thing that futures creates""

&amp;#x200B;

You don‚Äôt short Oil in winter. Period. Heck you shouldn‚Äôt even trade Oil. Only the expert can do this because it's called ‚ÄúWidow Maker‚Äù i.e. the losses in this commodity trading could be catastrophic planetary devastation like.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip : Btw currently oil is in downwards wedge and it could break to upside and we go up in winter but Oil too like gold doesn't love Dxy going up. So kinda mixed signals i guess. Let's see who shall prevail bulls or bears of oil.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Oil down and vice versa but Winter is coming/ Contango = Maybe Oil up.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 10 : Powell curve i.e.10 yr - 3 month, 2 yr - 3 month ( Pvt(o) and Elliot wave doesn't work here )

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys remember the talk we had with Powell earlier this year when he was trying to explain us that the inversion of the 10 yr - 2 yr curve doesn't mean anything and unless the near term curve inverts it's all okay. Well folks Powell near time curves are close to getting inverted. Therefore you‚Äôre seeing these Fed officials talk dovish recently. Coz if they invert Fed will lose their remaining 0.0000001% credibility. So let‚Äôs analyze them on a weekly time frame because on a monthly time frame they look super super bearish to me and there is no chance that the curve won‚Äôt invert at some point later on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[J Powell\/ Fed Curves : Us10y-Us03m , Us02y-Us03m](https://preview.redd.it/djrc8jaf83j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d99ee474cadfaa810f9d14a4dd3ac350a9591a)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* The current weekly candle in both curves are going to close lower than previous week which could suggest further downside risk.
* Stochastic Rsi on 10yr-3m looks flat dead whereas on 2yr-3m it looks like it is rising.
* MacD in both of them is showing us that the downwards declining move is losing its strength.
* As for Ketlner, well in both of them they are staying in the lower red band suggesting they are still in a bearish trend.

&amp;#x200B;

Larry Summers former Fed chairman came recently to Bloomberg saying that the Fed has shown in latest minutes that they don‚Äôt even know what they are doing. Hence they Bs‚Äôing us in their statement. I mean guys just read these hawkish and dovish points yourself. Also do check out the hidden statements in minutes which are pieces of advice for billionaires about liquidity and t-bills. Don‚Äôt forget my warning about bank runs. They are coming. My bet is Well‚Äôs Fargo Oct 2022/23 = Lehman brothers Oct 2008 or you could also go with lowest read by a bank in Fed stress test.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hawkish vs Dovish vs Billionaire's \( Highlighted in blue \) Fed minutes.](https://preview.redd.it/omb5j3ws83j91.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6158e6604b455fbd85a1d9a922db7ce00ec1e833)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for individual bonds and overall yield curve : 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonds :**

* Well 10 yr yields looks so good on both weekly and monthly time frame. So we go up in yields.
* 2 yr yields  look so good on weekly and waiting for monthly close making it bullish. Meaning on September Fed is gonna be dead. ( Yields will rise meaning bond prices go down with stocks )

Note : Once again i'm telling yields is going up due to Eur-usd down i.e. Dxy up and markets front running 95B/m QT. We are quite unsure about rate hikes coz its nearly 50-50 b/w 50 and 75 bps. It will all depend on Cpi and Jobs data in September.

&amp;#x200B;

* Institutions and Hf‚Äôs are also buying Chinese bonds like crazy or maybe Chinese themselves because of fear of recession and growth slowdown i.e. flight to safety trade. They have deflationary recession but the thing is they have balance sheet recession. So their government is creating a liquidity trap by cutting rates. But don't forget they can always do  exuberance amount of liquidity coz they have very less inflation. In Usa you're getting rekt in both stocks and bonds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yield curve :**

* As for the entire yield curve here look at these beauties that Powell has created in these charts.

&amp;#x200B;

[Credits : Eurodollar University. By Jeff Snyder](https://preview.redd.it/in4k23tl83j91.png?width=1427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8d4fbef2d512895f7d20db2b348b80b9907ebe)

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Yield should be higher if the time horizon is higher. Meaning shorter end like 2 yr to 5 yr should yield less than 10 yr and 20 yr normally due to unknown risks associated in far future. But look here in these charts. A 52 w t-bill is yielding more than 20 yr and 10 yr bonds. That‚Äôs insane. It tells us there is a danger in next 1-2yrs as compared to far in future. The curve has gone banana's b/w 26 w t-bill to 10 yr bond. After 10 yr to 20 yr curve looks so good and why won't it. Because after the most horrible decade in entire history of Usa will come a little less horrible decade. Haha.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say yields are going up in respective bonds. But will basic yield curve i.e us10y-us02y will steepen or invert more is out of my pay grade.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 11 : VIX. It looks so ready to pop anytime.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean what do i even say here. This whole year traders are buying Vix calls in 20 and shorting equities and as the Vix goes 30 they sell their calls and buy puts. Meanwhile longing their equities position.

So smart Vix traders, it's time to integrate the mega crash in your calculations. Meaning do the first phase of second part but leave tf out of second phase of second part i.e. don't buy puts on Vix and don't try to long equity in 30 coz this time folks are going to promised Vix 40+.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Vix is going up. Reason : It's mid terms + Putin x Jinpig x Biden at G8 = Volatility in Sept - Nov.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Conclusion :**

&amp;#x200B;

Financial derivation = Take those steps into consideration that you are confident in your analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

**So I chose my Eur-usd pokemon.**

Reason : I am quite confident in my analysis and Lagarde. Plus Fed minutes made a commentary about this that dollar is looking so strong as comparison to Euro. Maybe this too played a part in their recent dovish commentary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assuming :** Eur usd is going down coz Europe is f‚Äôed. ( We were most confident about this in all of our steps. Also my birdie told me 0.93 eur-usd traders have risen from their grave in options market )

&amp;#x200B;

**Above assumption ( proving in step 1 t.a. ) will mean :**

* Dxy go up due to the mirror chart theory.  ( 0.80-0.90 levels in eur-usd = 120 move in Dxy )

&amp;#x200B;

* So now equities, commodities, metals and rest other asset class will fall down.

&amp;#x200B;

But what about bonds?

&amp;#x200B;

* Well when the dollar strengthens then the countries who have dollar denominated debts have to sell their bonds and buy new bonds to refinance. Something like that. I think i butchered it. But yah it happens. Other reason being when dollar strengthens due to ext factors then its kinda like a rate hike. So since bonds don't like rate hike they sell off. Now add QT on top of it i.e 95B/m  + Us treasury will issue more long term bonds and cut treasury bill issuance. So 10yr to 20yr bond yields will go up.
* So now remains the case for 2yr bonds. The Fed will hike rates but it's kinda hinting that they won't go aggressive now coz they don't wanna overshoot and bring depression. Hence the 2yr bond will not go up more than the back end i.e. 10yr bond. Meaning us10y-us02y will move from inversion territory to steepening territory.
* T-bills is getting bought more instead of rrp. Hence t-bills are trading below rrp. Meaning billionaires or banks fear about incoming liquidity crisis or collateral shortage. So t-bills it is or cashola. Or you could go to a money market fund and park your money there coz banks don't give you anything. Let's cause bank run together next year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Also vix will pop up in this scenario due to asset classes being sold off

&amp;#x200B;

* The velocity of m2 is gonna go up suggesting economy expands. Nope. Imo its suggesting dollar milkshake theory coz m2 is going down. Less dollars will be in circulation but exchanges will remain same. ( Long shot. I really don't know. Just guessing )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Final Result :**

&amp;#x200B;

Every step we proved above using technical analysis on weekly and monthly time frame is being backed by my financial derivation except one thing. Will us10y-us02y curve invert more or steepen.? Coz steepening is bad for dollar strength whereas more inversion is good for dollar strength i.e. Dxy.

P.s. I think i'm so confused. Damn these bonds are tough to read.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : I forgot Dr copper. Lol. Why is it going up when Gold and other metals is going down?

\*\*\* Illuminati said : ""Coz Dxy move up or bond yields move up is not because of rate hikes. They all are priced in. It's because of pseudo rate hikes on the Global market that is causing dollar to strengthen. This is due to QT + Eur-usd , Gbp-usd going down. Throw Japanese yen in there too but its chart is going up coz its Usd-jpy pair not Jpy-usd. Just like i said before too.

421,1661032501,wtikk9,1,"**Thesis**: Bed Bath and Beyond maybe a dying retailer but has a few tricks up their sleeve. Ryan Cohen our lord and savior had purchased a 11.8% stake in towel stock. Consisting of $60 and $80 strikes for January. Retail picked this up once they saw the short interest was 52% they pounced. Short interest is considered high at 1/5th the float of outstanding shares (20%). Ryan then proceeds to write a letter to the board detailing their potential and how the management was BOGUS for a lack of a better term. This was in April ‚Äì May timeframe. Fast forward a few months to June-July and the CEO essentially gets outed by Ryan Cohen and friends with him also putting two of his own on their board. Now with the fear of filing for bankruptcy our boys over at the towel stock $BBBY management decides to partner with RC Ventures LLC (Ryan Cohens firm) to help them rebalance their balance sheet. But here‚Äôs where things get a little bit out of hand. Ryan files a form 144 (defined by the SEC as do they not obligate a party to sell the position outlined, [the SEC says](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/form-144) someone filing this form ""must have a bona fide intention to sell the securities referred to in the Form within a reasonable time after the filing of the Form."" He then proceeds to sell all of his stake over the course of two days 8/16-8/17. The stock stays up through all this still nailing a 70% on one market session. Then on 8/18 mainstream media pushes out articles almost at the same exact time as a massive 30-40% drop in afterhours. Mind you through all of this many tweets were sent out by Jim Cramer slandering the company, Ryan Cohen, and worst of all RETAIL. Beginning 8/9 and continuing throughout the following weeks (tweets at the end of the document). Ryan must reinvest his profits of 58 million odd back into the company hopefully clearing up more of their debt. Rumor has it that their will be a buyout of BUY BUY BABY (Buy Buy Baby, Inc. is an American chain of stores that sell clothing, strollers and other items for use with infants and young children. It operates 133 stores across the United States and Canada. The chain was founded in 1996 by brothers Richard and Jeffrey Feinstein"" ‚Äì as defined by google. As depicted in his letter to the board as seen below RC Ventures evaluation puts the market capitalization far above $BBBY current market cap of 1 billion. They‚Äôre valuing it in the ballpark of 7 billion. That would put our share price in the high double digits to low triple digits. As of this writing on 8/20 we‚Äôre trading at $9.79 as of close Friday the 19th. Historical earnings places the dates around 9/28-10/03. The bear thesis is that they will announce bankruptcy on this call. But with all of these variables at play with BUY BUY BABY acquisition, Ryan Cohen leading the charge on management, high short interest, retail sentiment is still intact, mainstream media openly slandering the stock across the board, increased volume day over day, and the final most important blow was $BBBY announcing they were partnering with our boys over at RC Ventures. Price targets for this are $50-$130 in the next 6 months to a year. With a small float of 68.21 million compared to Gamestops few hundred million in shares this can run up to triple digits no problem. The setups there for a run to those highs and all we need is the good PR to send us all the way.

This first picture is what Ryan Cohen proposed to BBBY in March. At the time the stock price was $15. Assuming market cap estimates. Over $1B. This is massive as that will provide enough liquidity to not only pay off important debt but provide a nice cash balance for the company. They can then issue shares when the stock price has hit let‚Äôs say conservatively $50. That is something that both AMC and GME did. Look at their stock price today and look at their chart. Money to be made.

[Ryan cohens letter to bbby](https://imgur.com/a/uhoN8AV)

Their liquidity is 1.14. Anything above 1 is good. A good liquidity ratio is anything greater than 1. It indicates that the company is in good financial health and is less likely to face financial hardships. Copy pasted from Google. So bbby has enough capital I.E. buy buy baby to be in an even better financial spot after the sale or spinoff.

424,1660948667,wsr3py,1,"Fellow retards,

I got in on the GM3 play (I'm using 3's because not quite sure why the first post was removed) and had a ton of fun. Had a profitable play, learned about Reddit and this sub, eventually branched out into some other subs I love now too. But as the GM3 play played out, there was a lot of discussion and evolution. People were openly debating buying shares vs options. What options made the most sense. How a g@mma sque3ze worked and what it took to happen. It was lively, it moved, it evolved, it transformed. I didn't participate in the BBB3Y play, the timing was bad for me and I just never got into it, it be like that sometimes. But I did watch it play out, read the posts, watched the price. 

In the spirit of that, and now that the autopsy of BB3Y is being discussed, I'd like to throw an idea out there on how to evolve the sque3ze. 

I watched for 3 days straight as BB3Y got hammered in after hours. There were 2 nights I specifically remember, and took pictures of, where it got smashed down 50%. After Hours trading doesn't show up when you Google the stock, you have to watch it live. I think a lot of people missed that. **And I think a lot of people are missing the golden opportunity here of an After Hours sque3ze technique.** It's never been done by retail, I don't even trade after hours, I still need to apply for that. So take that with a grain of salt as we go, I'm learning as well. 

I asked a reputable sub to explain how -50%ing a stock after hours was so easy to do 3 days in a row. This is the dumbed down explanation I got. 

&amp;#x200B;

.............................Just to share something: large volume isn't necessary to move any stock at all. All that's necessary is a consensus among market participants that the price is now lower.

The stock market is run by an order book. Everyone puts their orders in. You put in an order to buy 100 shares at $20. Someone else puts in an order to sell 100 at $21. Other people fill the gap (20.35, 20.58, etc). Finally when someone decides to cross the spread (seller comes in and doesn't want to sell at $21, he wants to sell at whatever the best bid is, in this case $20.35), the price changes.

Only 1 share changing hands is required to change a price. Imagine a situation where there are tens of thousands of orders in the book at all different prices. The bid/ask spread sits at $20.48 / $20.52. Suddenly some news comes out and is efficiently spread instantly. And then every buyer says ""oh no, i'm not bidding $20.48 anymore. I'm gonna bid $10"". In reality not everyone moves down at the exact second, but lets say 98% of the real players do. What remains are a few rogue orders from retail investers at $18, 16.50, etc. The spread now sits at $18 bid (only 100 shares available), $20.52 ask. The sellers then go, ""oh this news is bad. We need to sell."" and they sell 100 shares at $18. No new buyers come in because, i mean, the news is pretty horrible. Tthe next buyer is another slow retail investor who left his order open, bidding 16. The sellers sell 100 shares at $16. No new buyers come in. The next shares available are down at $10. Some sellers decide to hit that price to gtfo at any price.

In the above example, the stock dropped from $20 to $10 with only 300 shares traded. It could have occurred in under a second. All you need is one guy to limit sell 300 shares with a $10 limit to move the price from $20 to $10. All you need are all the buyers to pull back at the same time, and all the sellers to also recognize they have no hope of selling at the current price and moving down as well. All you need is market consensus...............................................

&amp;#x200B;

**Immediately after I read that I thought, holy shit, I bet the reverse of that works too.** Because the volume is so low in AH trading, it wouldn't take that much. A ladder up of placed bids, say the stock was trading at $10 during market, the ladder would be like $10-$11-$12-$13-$14 could quickly get it up double, just like getting it down half. Sprinkle in a well placed options ladder hitting ITM and presto. You've got yourself a squeeze in half the time, with half the money.

If you google the number of contracts in the picture you will get an answer as below.

**7475: The Drive to Succeed**

Do you keep on seeing Angel Number 7475 everywhere you go? It is a sign that your angel numbers have an important message for you. The divine realm is always looking out for you. They want the best for you at all times. You will see this number no matter what you are doing because it is important in your life.

**3782: You Can Handle Anything**

Your guardian angels are reminding you that you have the full support of the divine realm. Angel Number 3782 is assuring you that you are on the right path, and with the guidance of your angels, nothing is impossible in your life. Your guardian angels are reassuring you to keep doing what you are doing because it will lead to your success.

**444:** **The Deeper Meaning**

‚Ä¶Moreover, it is also reminding you to stay on the life path that you are on. Furthermore, 444 in a numerology reading stands for guidance to rely on the encouragement of your angels. Thereby, they tend to lead you towards your promising future.

**3826:** **Inner Wisdom Is an Important Tool for Achieving Success.**

Angel Number 3826 is a message from your guardian angels that you need to possess inner wisdom if you want to win in life. Knowledge will enable you to achieve things in your life that you can only imagine. Make wise decisions and choices in life and always stay on the right path.

**1174: 1174 is leetspeak for ""Meet in person at."" It is typically used in text messages to discreetly refer to the place where the sender and recipient(s) will meet together to party. 1174 is often used by teenagers to covertly communicate about party plans in case a parent or other authority figure sees the conversation.**

**Interesting isn‚Äôt?** 

As all of us Ryan Cohen is a chess player and a good chess players doesn‚Äôt use old moves. 

NO INVESTOR WOULD SELL HIS SHARES RIGHT BEFORE FRIDAY SQUEEZE WAVE!!!!! (when the brokers call the headgies to cover)

So why did He sold right before Friday? The stock had the momentum to pass 35 EOW easily! Well few reasons

1. He set (trap) an interesting opportunity for short sellers. To Short More. Which makes the squeeze juicier! (I bet the SI will be much higher)

2. If he made that move anytime later (like at 4B market cap) the stock would not continue rising (it‚Äôs way more easier for us to move the stock up with 1b vs a 4b market cap or more) 

3. His profits go to bbby which makes bbby to be able to continue their operation until their funding is secured ( he filled 144 and he had more than 10 percent therefore the rule applies).

**I bet all of you were looking at the üíú at least one time today.**

Do you want to know the meaning? 

The Purple Heart medal is presented to service members who have been wounded or killed as a result of enemy action while serving in the U.S. military. A Purple Heart is a solemn distinction and means a service member has greatly sacrificed themselves, or paid the ultimate price, while in the line of duty.

He is telling us that he sacrificed his profit in order to help bbby

My guess: United Therapeutics will buy it someday or LQDA will take some of their pie. 

And Martin Shkreli the OG also did the research and it matches with mine. His DD on LQDA is also on wsb. Search it you lazy bums.

Just buy and hold. You should make some money back.

# RC Ventures files to sell stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond

Kevin P. Curran, SA News Editor

(Seeking Alpha)

Per a form 144 filing, GameStop chairman Ryan Cohen‚Äôs RC Ventures has filed to sell 9.45M shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) through JP Morgan Securities.

That figure represented his entire stake as of August 16, the date of the 144 filing as well.

‚ÄúRC Ventures directly beneficially owned 9,450,100 Shares, including 1,670,100 Shares underlying certain call options, constituting approximately 11.8% of the Shares outstanding,‚Äù a 13-D filing on Tuesday stated.

Shares of the beleaguered retailer pared gains sharply in late trading on Wednesday, falling more than 10% from the peak marked prior to the disclosure. The move also attracted negative social media attention as it remains the most talked-about stock on Wall Street Bets. The stock‚Äôs ticker has also become a trending topic on Google, with search interest rising sharply in the month of August.

*Google Search interest over time:*

However, the surges in search and social media interest are not the only metrics rising well above average. For example, over 220M shares changed hands on Wednesday, continuing a trend after trading volume spiked to nearly 400M on Tuesday. Options action likewise remained unusually active on Wednesday. The elevated trading action potentially involved Cohen, whose purchase of out-of-the-money options helped spark a squeeze this week.

462,1660704806,wqdjc9,1,"For all spaceballs fans, this is approaching ludacris speed.  For all non-financial experts here this is a synopsis of how ludacris speed takes place when applied to this situation from the perspective of what can be controlled.  Nobdoy can control what the shorts are doing, but can control what they are doing.

Example:

\-You purchase 1 BBBY 08/19/22 13.00 C @ 1.81

\-What does this mean - this means that at any point before the end of the day on 8/19/22 (August 19 2022) you can purchase 100 Shares of BBBy for $13.00 per share.  This is a contract.

\-The original cost to you based on the security ""1 BBBY 08/19/22 $13.00 C"" is $181.10 (100 multiplied by $1.81).  All other things equal, one of two things can happen: BBBY, the stock, increases or decreases.  If the stock price of BBBY is $20 a share and you have 1 option to purchase 100 shares, the ""BBBY 08/19/22 13.00 C @ 1.81"" is now worth $700 ($20 (current market price) minus $13 (the price you can purchase shares at, Multiplied by 100), so you should have a gain of $519.  You can now help the add to both the cause and the effect.  Share prices increase as more and more shares are purchased at higher and higher prices.  By selling your ""BBBY 08/19/22 $13.00 C"" and purchasing ordinary shares of the BBBY ticker, you are increasing the market price of the stock.  At which point you can sell the shares and pick up more calls, or have a split between the two (more Call options (securities similar to the ""BBBY 08/19/22 13.00 C @ 1.81"") and also buy more shares along the way, which will continue to have a positive impact on the share price.

This is a circular feedback loop that is propelled by the purchasing of shares, especially shares that are purchased after selling securities similar to ""BBBY 08/19/22 13.00 C @ 1.81"", since these ""BBBY 08/19/22 13.00 C @ 1.81"" securities have outsided gains.  Regardless, the earnings from the securities  similar to ""BBBY 08/19/22 13.00 C @ 1.81"" feed the purchase or BBBY shares.

In summary: the more shares that are purhcased, the higher the price goes.  As the price goes higher, large institutions who purchased puts, or securities similar to ""BBBY 08/19/22 13 P @ 1.81"" have to purchase shares at the market price ($20 in this example) and then sell the shares for $13, which generates a huge loss.  By having to purchase the shares, this ramps up volume as well, pushing the stock further into Ludacris Speed.

Think about the feedback loop as a pig's tail, that little curly cue.  It just keeps moving up and up.

Having worked with these people before, I can assure you they will not miss one of their multi million dollar homes - which may have been financed through the PPP program that was supposed to be for regular mom &amp; pop small businesses (truth is the lack of oversight on this is such a shame and is all public knowledge, google ""PPP loans"" and add your zip code to see who got what!  Hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds were foaming at the mouth trying to push these applications through for themselves - I know because I was asked to do so.  This is a battle no doubt.  The odds stacked against the poor and the middle class and the people on the other side of what hedge fund managers and the like will call opportunity.

They do not care about you, until now.

3. The word on the street is Telnyx has partnered with Union Square Capital as the financing partner on the funding. Telnyx is a fast growing startup but they must be looking to take out their bigger competitor, BANDWIDTH
4. I believe their financing partner has been shorting the stock to exhaust all holders so they can buy as much as the company at a lowest possible price.
5. If we degens take ownership before they do, we are going to have to make them pay much higher prices for Bandwidth shares and/or make them cover at much higher prices.
6. My claim that they could be shorting is just a theory, but I think it makes sense. I've been following the ticker very closely and in my experience there is someone short that is trying to corner the stock

The stock has triple bottomed at $15 and is looking to make a major break above $21. When it does there is a massive vacuum back to $70s. There is ZERO reason this company should be trading below where it traded before the pandemic.

I understand the pandemic pump was unsustainable but most of these tech companies returned to prepandemic valuations. In this stock it would be in the $70s-$80s, but it's trading at $19 while the fundamentals have been extremely resilient. The company is growing at a 20% clip.

468,1660674985,wq1x61,1,"I decided to do some DD on Faze Holdings, the Faze Clan Boys, who are known to be posting tik-tok video's in their million dollar Hollywood mansions while being completely drunk and high on painkillers causing trouble in the neighborhood. 

Also, Faze Holdings seems to be a very conspicuous company. In March 2022, the company went public through a SPAC merger valued at 275m. Faze Holdings is valued around 1.281bn at the moment.

I want to show you the majority shareholder list first, source: [https://fintel.io/so/us/faze](https://fintel.io/so/us/faze)

Youssef is a Faze Clan member and devoted gamer, this is him: 

&amp;#x200B;

Abdelfattah Yousef "")

He holds about 4.2m shares of the company, currently valued at 56.3m dollars at the current price. This guy would represent 1/5th of the value of the business, he has no knowledge or degree on running business, and above all I couldn't find his LinkedIn account... 

*Processing img 3r7zytff94i91...*

Let's watch the second shareholder in the first image, a guy called  [Treschow Michael Stang](https://fintel.io/i/treschow-michael-stang) 

I was hoping to get some results on this guy, but the best information I got was through a rough google search and watching the summary of this guy's life in four pictures (he didn't show up on Linkedin, and I couldn't find any information or that he was from Norway):

*Processing img 9pndyjzx94i91...*

I still need to look up the other majority shareholders, but let's leave it at there. 

Looking at the 10-Q report that came out recently, Faze is looking in absolute dire straits. They hold 42K USD cash, and 172.8M USD in 'Investments held in Trust Account'. If anyone can help me find their real value these accounts, I hope that would add to the thesis. 

 

*Processing img mpjzna96b4i91...*

**Their financial metrics are also among one of the worst:** 

\- 

*Processing img raz08hp4c4i91...*

They burned more cash than they have on balance at this moment. All the cash they have is in 'Trust accounts', I'm not so sure about the liquidity of those assets (imo they could be mostly real estate like assets, with a dash of Adam Neumann 'community adjusted' valuation to keep it fresh). Look at the burn rate, their 10-Q states they have 43 thousand US Dolans to cover their expenses, but they seem to be losing more than -645% ( =-27,000,000 / 41,836) down on cash at the moment. 

I called my broker to allow me to buy put options dated Jan 2023 to Jan 2024, and will put in a long put position on Faze for 3k USD tomorrow).

Educational Tip to help increase BBBY stock sales 

Stocks do not crash anymore. So BBBY is going higher than Tesla. Google ‚Äústock circuit breaker‚Äù and teach your APE friends! This is the way!

August 15, 2022
By: United Maps

A public event planning company is helping many wallstreetsbets users learn to make profit trading BBBY. The energetic CEO of the Atlanta maybe, maybe not public planning company says they even have a meeting as a celebration party in February 2023.

‚ÄúWe have so much invested already. BBBY ‚Äî will eventually surpass Elon Musk‚Äôs TESLA on the stock market. Training is going good! More people are buying, and that is good for the American economy. Elon, Ryan, and I are all good for American small time investors.‚Äù

Bold prediction. What do you think? Does GameStop‚Äôs Ryan Cohen believe it could happen? Would this be good for those who have coin and BBBY in their portfolios? Is Elon behind the latest coin uptrends? What do you think? One thing is for sure the Mom and pop American will be the winner either way!


End of story

*****
Spread to Twitter please. Tag Elon musk. Please This is part of our Twitter advertising plan for BBBY. It‚Äôs a part of a script written. It goes to January 5, 2022. It‚Äôs called a story turn. So expect the unexpected once word gets back to Elon about this. The purpose is to gain exposure and bring in coin investors. Their coins are low in price so they have money to bet on both. The next story turn happens on August 23, 2022. Please let your friends know. Also Google ‚Äústock market circuit breakers.‚Äù We can fall to zero like what happened in to old days. Educate the people. When we educate we win! Then we bottom as per the charts is $20, then we test the new high of $33. $20.01 to $32.99 should be a breeze as per the technicals. Let‚Äôs get rich.

You can join and become a share holder in what we are building. 

Obviously lots of meetings to report more in the future, but the first is scheduled. Not only can you get rich trading correctly, now our OCCUPY WALLSTREET movement is being grown into a full blown company. We already have a lawyer, and I am the CEO. We operate near Atlanta, Georgia. Again zero cost, but you get an opportunity to compete to be a 1099 contractor with our company. You will get additional tax breaks, and even share holder status, voting rights, and influence. Plus after the profits increase, I would love for the board to vote on a dividend. Then we eventually list on the stock market. 

We are a private company now, but I have a vision for more. So join what we are doing. We are tomorrow‚Äôs future. So what‚Äôs our product?

Our products is ‚Äúorganization.‚Äù We package organizing into a fun experience, for profit. You are already aware of some of the services a company like ours would provide. If you know who Eric Thomas is, or Tony Robbins, then maybe you have seen them speak at a huge event planned by a for profit company. 

Some of you maybe, maybe not have ever went to a big arena to see and hear him. With the pandemic subsiding we have lots of profits to take home. You all can share in your fair share as a result of the risk you wager and energy you expend doing our work. 

Our work is the work to benefit the Mom and pop retail investors like you. Why? Well I am just like many of you. We are like each other more than we are different. 

There is no better place for ‚Äúevent planners‚Äù to make money commercially then in hosting events for the stock market lovers of our future, with stock market lovers as the employees, and services designed for new stock market retail investors by stock market retail investors, the world will change. 

For sure the US will change for the better. Profits will be shared more fairly. The rich will still be known, but the disparity between the rich and the poor in America will change. 

Some of you know why? Some of you don‚Äôt. Some of you are just here for money. So be your own boss. Get a 1099 each year. Have a home office, and work from home. 

We have so much to share, but obviously this is not the proper forum for dialogue. I want to hear from you. So call me. My number can be asked for if you send me a request via inbox. 

We are not going to share our complete hand, because our company already exists in a competitive market. We also already own a tech company, and a lobbying company. Now I know someone wants to call ‚Äúhe is crapping me‚Äù but this is as real as GME +300 is. Obviously everyone in the world will not be employed by us, but you really can. This is easier than most of you think. It‚Äôs easier to become debt free, and bring in income if you know how to design your life in a way that is fun! 

That is what we are about fun! Serious event planners apply. Send your reason for wanting to participate as formally or informally as you want to my inbox. I will be looking for only the best talent. I am looking for new additions to the wallstreetsbets bets movements, and old Apes who helped occupy Wall Street. 

There is a lot of money in the world, many of you all see that now. I want to show you more. The humble will respond, those who this is not for will use their valuable time and reply with none sense. I hope you respond to me. Either way, no this is going on in the background. 

We also have a second lawyer on retainer for criminal offenses. Wall Street hedge fund managers who have been using risky practices for years are going to see we are manipulating a market. We are going to say we are doing what we are doing. Planning fun events, and connecting like minded people with like minded people. 

Our first event maybe, maybe not will occur in Atlanta Georgia in February! To be determined exactly if this is a service our community wants. You will be the buyers so you matter the most. 
That is something companies forget.


Maybe hosted at the Hyatt, but many of you will rent Air B&amp;Bs. Research Atlanta. I welcome you to our city. 

It‚Äôs so much to discuss, and debrief. There are more investment cycles to start and bull. We bull, and we have fun! That is the way!

So I invite you to come listen and learn our Company core values and mission for a more peaceful world.  This was the event we have been waiting on!

In closing, our future, and our company will be the official host you can count on for these events. Even if you find another competitor in this market, at least you can respect that we took BBBY to be more costly than Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla. 

Seriously, that is my prediction, and I have a friend who use to work in SpaceX who maybe, maybe not will help. Imagine this:

Hopefully there will be a hedge fund manager who we caused to lose money with us by then. Imagine then explaining why you inspired them to  chose our side and support BBBY, as they figured things out. How many times have you wanted more support?

When you really think about why would anyone bet on companies in a way that increases the likelihood of bankruptcy? Is that what we do now as humans. We bet to unemploy our human family members. No as an activist I have to speak a new possibility.


I am not here to say, I have a solution for how the market was designed, but as a lobbyist who passed laws in states I know design is key to reality reinforcers which yield problems. Can you imagine a new futuristic stock market that helps the US economy? 

Fans of us from the global economy would bet to preserve the companies traded there. You all could still be meme stock traders, or again work for the company I am describing. Either way, keep the BBBys going, and remember organizing and event planning is key to making money. 

Check the technicals. We are about to have a new bottom. Also Google ‚Äúcircuit breakers‚Äù and how they are used to prevent a free fall of a stock from crashing. So we always get a new bottom. 

Many are not aware circuit breakers are a part of new age trading! So join us! Maybe, maybe not. We just have to create the inspiration to make an Mt Everest climb. Is it possible?

Imagine our publicly held BBBY company going hire than Elon‚Äôs Tesla! That is the bet I am making. Sharing on Twitter! üòâ 

Elon we are coming for you respectfully. Will we moon higher than Tesla? Only you can decide if it happens!

My position : 21,600 shares and adding (500-1000 per day) (As of 8/15/2022)

About : Bandwidth is a leading enterprise cloud communications company. Companies like Cisco, Google, Microsoft, RingCentral, Uber, and Zoom use Bandwidth's APIs to easily embed voice, messaging and emergency services into software and applications. Bandwidth is the first and only CPaaS provider offering a robust selection of communications APIs built around their own IP voice network.

Thesis :

1. $1.17mm in insider purchases over the last 4 months.
2. Privately held competitor named Telnyx recently took a 6.5% stake. Privately held competitors don't just buy a stake for equity appreciation, they buy for a hostile takeover / tender offer
3. SI is around 15%
4. Insiders own over 10%
5. Cash on hand : $300mm with a market cap of $450mm
6. Trading at less than 1x sales, while most enterprise software fetches 5-7x sales!
7. Institutions own 94.8% of the float
8. Low float - only 25mm shares
9. Recently crushed earnings, maintained revenue guidance (which was raised in the prior quarter)
10. IPO'd in 2017 at $20/share, traded around $80 BEFORE the pandemic, then hit $175 during the pandemic pump, now is back down to $19/share.
11. Despite trading below it's IPO price from 2017, the company has quadrupled revenues
12. This is not some 2020 spac, ark complex, pump and dump. It's a small cap tech company that is being overlooked by the market.
13. Company was founded in 1999
14. 21-22 is an area of resistance, above that is a black hole back to $70.  They are doing everything they can to keep it below 21-22.

Potential Conspiracy Theory

1. While we know for a fact Telnyx has acquired a 6.5% stake per their latest 13G filing (just google it), the trading on this equity has been VERY sus since then.
2. They must disclose any buys/sells and since the latest 13G there have been none. They don't have to disclose short positions
3. The word on the street is Telnyx has partnered with Union Square Capital as the financing partner on the funding. Telnyx is a fast growing startup but they must be looking to take out their bigger competitor, BANDWIDTH
4. I believe their financing partner has been shorting the stock to exhaust all holders so they can buy as much as the company at a lowest possible price.
5. If we degens take ownership before they do, we are going to have to make them pay much higher prices for Bandwidth shares and/or make them cover at much higher prices.
6. My claim that they could be shorting is just a theory, but I think it makes sense. I've been following the ticker very closely and in my experience there is someone short that is trying to corner the stock

The stock has triple bottomed at $15 and is looking to make a major break above $21. When it does there is a massive vacuum back to $70s. There is ZERO reason this company should be trading below where it traded before the pandemic.

I understand the pandemic pump was unsustainable but most of these tech companies returned to prepandemic valuations. In this stock it would be in the $70s-$80s, but it's trading at $19 while the fundamentals have been extremely resilient. The company is growing at a 20% clip.

488,1660530769,wonv8n,1,"I recently commented some dumb shit about my fucked up life in the daily thread and it gave me a great idea. WSB needs more community made ETFs to profit off of fucked up real world situations. BECKY is not enough, I honestly don't even think it scratches the surface. Divorce, though sad, is a massive opportunity to turn other peoples pain and confusion into profit. Bottom line, I'm pissed at my Mom and I want my money back, so this is how I plan on getting it. 

Fellas and girl, I present to you, MOMWHY: The Divorce ETF.

Google says that most divorces are caused by these 5 things:
-infidelity
-addiction
-lack of Intimacy 
-money
-communication 

I will look at each of these causes using my own personal experience as a child that grew up in a divorced household, and curate a list of 5 stocks that I consider to be leaders in profiting off of the pain and confusion of a family being torn apart. 



INFIDELITY. Classic. When your wife turns out to be batshit insane, you might be more inclined to say fuck it and go on that deep sea fishing trip in Costa Rica. While you're down there, you may find yourself surprised that Costa Rican hookers can be quite attractive and affordable, especially if you're a white upper middle class banker wearing a polo and a visor. But when you return to your miserable wife in the states and realize that your dick has a rash, you're going to panic and throw money at anything that will make the rash disappear before your wife feels guilty for not being around much and decides to blow you for 30 miserable seconds. 

The infidelity pick was obvious. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ). Rest assured that when your dick itches and marriage falls apart, Johnson &amp; Johnson will be there with every oil, creme, soap, shampoo, and ointment for your infidelity needs.





ADDICTION. Too easy. Constellation Brands (STZ) is balls deep in alcohol and weed. You'll drink and smoke away the pain and confusion, and so will your kids when they realize that Dad wasn't an alcoholic boogeyman, he was just sad, And then Mom took the house he bought. 




LACK OF INTIMACY. This one is tricky. It's easy to profit off of Intimacy, but a LACK of it? When Dad comes home from his miserable job, all he wants is to get trashed and watch the game. When Mom comes home from her miserable job, all she wants to do is offload her toxic negativity onto her kids and husband. The kids are either covering their ears while Dad is yelling at the TV, or covering their ears while Mom is yelling at them. 

üí°üí°üí°BUT WHAT'S THE DOG DOING?????
Enjoying the FUCK out of that overpriced Greenie Dental Chew. 
Chewy Inc. (CHWY)
next.




MONEY. If you had enough money, you wouldn't have to work 9-5 Monday thru Friday and completely miss out on your kid's childhoods and then overcompensate for it in their late teens by making them do a bunch of stupid shit outside with you that neither you nor them actually want to do. If you had money, you might actually have a chance at being a competent parent and a  contributing member of society. 

But the reality is that you don't have money so everything is fucked. You know who knows you don't have money and figured out a way to charge you for it? Wells Fargo (WFC).

Did you know that the CEO of Wells Fargo once had a yacht named ""Overdraft"" ?üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è




COMMUNICATION. You might think that communication is lowest between the husband and wife in a divorce. In reality, communication is lowest between the parents and kids in a divorce. The parents don't regard their kids as human beings. They regard them as slightly higher than the dog on the totem pole, but really not that much higher. By age 7, the kids will totally give up on trying to communicate with their parents as well. Instead, the kids will use their fat stacks of cash gifted by parents and grandparents that feel guilty during the holidays and use it to buy:

Video games. Why deal with the bullshit when you can ignore it? Why live in reality when you can strap on a pair of goggles and live in a different reality? 
This pick might not be popular among some of you, but there's a clear winner for denying reality out there. Facebook/Meta whateverthefuck (FB).


There we have it folksü§Æüí©

Bandwidth is the first and only CPaaS provider offering a robust selection of communications APIs built around their own IP voice network. 

Over the last 5 months, insiders have purchased $1.17mln in open market purchases.

One of it's main competitors (privately held) telnyx acquired a 6.5% stake at prices over 50% higher than the current share price.

Insiders control around 10% of the stock and the SI stands around 15%.

While this company did enjoy a pandemic pump from $75--&gt;$175, it now trades at $19/share.  The company continues to grow organically at a healthy clip and has a serious moat, owning it's entire infrastructure and network.  

This enables them to be the low cost competitor and own a very valuable asset.

Given the flurry of insider buys and major stake by a competitor, I believe something could be in the works.  

Irregardless, I believe the company to be extremely undervalued.  Trading at less than 1x sales, most enterprise software companies trade around 6x sales.  Actually, it has $300mln in cash and the market cap is $450mln, but annual revenues this year will be $560mm.  SUPER CHEAP.

Hope everyone is having a great Friday. 

I've recently posted about Bandwidth, ticker $BAND.

To recap, Bandwidth is a leading enterprise cloud communications company. Companies like Cisco, Google, Microsoft, RingCentral, Uber, and Zoom use Bandwidth's APIs to easily embed voice, messaging and emergency services into software and applications. Bandwidth is the first and only CPaaS provider offering a robust selection of communications APIs built around their own IP voice network. 

I did not talk about the recently acquired stake of their competitor in much detail, but I think it's very important on what could happen in the coming months with this company.

Telnyx is a privately held competitor which has teamed up with a financing partner to potentially acquire the company.  No privately held tech start-up just acquires shares in a competitor for share appreciation.  They have been quietly building a stake in the company which will most likely end up in a hostile or tender offer for BAND shares.  

Their cost average is most likely in the high $20s so they are really underwater now, but that being said, BAND used to trade in the $70s BEFORE the pandemic when their revenues were way less then they are now.

With the recent insider buys and a competitor lurking in the background, this stock should not be trading at $18.00/share.  It IPO'd in 2017 for $20/share and revenues have more than tripled..

507,1659711181,wgxhu8,1," Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world‚Äôs most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.

In a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company‚Äôs proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.

Tesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today‚Äôs closing price the new share price would be around $308.

Though the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don‚Äôt impact a company‚Äôs market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.

Tesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla‚Äôs 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.

Several other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet‚Äôs split 20:1 in February and Amazon‚Äôs stock split 20:1 split one month later.

TUI Group¬†is a German leisure, travel and tourism¬†company, one of the largest in the world. The business model of this company should be known, I'd to shortly DD finical side.   
    
At Feb 2020, the price of TUI shares was¬†over EUR 10, to drop and fluctuate at about 3 euro after Covid starts. The tourism industry has died down, i.e. TUI decided to take a government aid to survive. Founds been mainly taken from¬†the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) bank, the German Economic Stabilization Fund (WSF), called alled ""Silent partnership‚Äù. At June 2021, total debt was ‚Ç¨ 6.8 billion. 

Initially, the plan was to pay off the loans created after Covid from the company's profits, but the protracted pandemic (omicron variant) and uncertainty about the possibility of a quick return of, in particular, airports to pre-pandemic turnover, resulted in the decision of the management of TUI issuing 162,291,441 new shares for the price EUR 2.62 per unit, which was 10% lower than the current market price. The company raised EUR 425 million and informed that it would use this amount to settle part of its debt. Analysts had assumed the possibility of increasing capital in this way long before. As a result, on June 30, the TUI group repaid the second tranche of the aid received in the form of various financial instruments, including state guarantees. It is 725 million euros, this is the amount returned to the Economic Stability Fund, including interest, and they also reduced the credit line from the Reconstruction Fund (KfW) from 2.4 billion to 2.1 billion. The previous tranches in the amount of 700 million TUI paid in April 2022. 

Unfortunately, the issue of new shares, although it helped to pay off the debt, caused the share price to drop. This should come as no surprise as no investor likes to dilute stocks, especially if the capital of these shares is intended for repayment of liabilities. So why did I decide to buy a stake?   
    
TUI has presented a plan to get out of its debt and is implementing it, unlike, for example, the British Rolls Royc, which in my opinion is in a worse position and the management is not able to come up with concrete steps to pay off its huge debts, in return we keep hearing about new plans development of the company (Construction of nuclear mini-reactors), which will certainly generate new costs. This shows that the company's financial policy may be different and short-sighted.   
    
Finally, I would like to point out that the investment in TUI is still a high risk, but in my opinion a healthy financial policy deserves some confidence in the future, therefore I allocated 6% of my portfolio to the purchase of shares with an average purchase price of 1.645

509,1659642772,wgaiq6,1,"Block, Inc., formerly Square, Inc., is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.

Consider the fact that the company's stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&amp;P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.

**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**

https://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq

Square on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. 

In its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.

Cash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.

**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**

At the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.

Square is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square's gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.

Square and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.

**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**

In a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.

""Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term,"" he wrote.

Announced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging ""[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)"" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM). Some investors questioned whether Block needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the buy now, pay later market. Block's 2022 guidance includes an expected $1 billion in Afterpay operating expenses. UBS analyst Rayna Kumar in a report said the ""risk profile"" of Afterpay has changed amid rising interest rates and the potential of increased regulation.

Square stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.

**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**

For merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there's still a risk of defaults.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App's direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.

Square is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.

The Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company's subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.

To broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma's tax business for $50 million in cash. It's a free service for consumers.

**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**

With roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved ""upmarket,"" targeting larger businesses.

SQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).

In addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.

Square recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.

**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**

The company's Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.

Meanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.

Square on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.

In trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.

One key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume ‚Äî total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers ‚Äî also known as GPV. It's a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.

**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Square earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.

Square said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.

Financial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.

Gross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.

In a letter to shareholders, management said: ""Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square.""

Excluding Afterpay, the company said ""gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year.""

**Block Stock Technical Analysis**

After its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.

That soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google in stature.

Following its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019. Then shares surged in 2020 as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App.",Why I'm getting SQ calls for tonight's earnings.,1.0,2022-08-04 19:52:52

Today we  talk about the CircleDNA

In February 2019, Berry Genenomics, a leading domestic genetic testing enterprise, and Prenetics limited invested in the establishment of ""circle DNA"" to complete the establishment of the main management team. Yan Jun, the former general manager of Google China strategic cooperation, served as CEO.

Berry gene said in its 2018 annual report that investing in CircleDNA is ""a strategic layout for the company to try to enter the field of consumer gene testing and realize the reasonable extension of the gene testing industry chain to the downstream"".

On June 26, 2018, 23 Rubik's cube released a price reduction announcement, and a genetic test was reduced from 499 yuan to 299 yuan. These two events can be regarded as two driving factors for the development of DTC gene detection: application scenario and price.

At present, the brands of consumer gene testing in China include 23 Rubik's cube, Wegene,Micro gene, Anwo gene, Colorful DNA, Jellyfish Gene, Jiujiu gene,CircleDNA and Genetreasure. Among them, 23 Rubik's cube has completed round C financing. Wegene micro gene obtained round B financing. Domestic gene testing companies mainly engaged in clinical and scientific research include berry gene, Daan gene, Dean diagnostics, Jinyu medicine, etc. Berry gene has a market value of 13.493 billion yuan and a net profit of 313 million yuan in Q3, a year-on-year increase of 30.96%.",The origin of CircleDNA,1.0,2022-08-04 15:25:24

Many data points are showing, that there is a big demand for Crocs and their newly acquired brand Hey Dude.  
Crocs have gained a lot of popularity on TikTok - with close to 5 billion views with the hashtag #crocs on TikTok alone and hundreds of new videos added EVERY DAY.

Crocs design variations are endless. Starting with conservative designs and ending with crazy designs and various cross-brand collaborations. Furthermore, Jibbitz serves as leverage for that personalization.

Crocs have high recognition and virality. When you go to the beach or down the street and someone is wearing Crocs, unlike Skechers, you know those are Crocs. This creates interest in the brand. The old ugly becomes trendy and ICONIC.

The economy has recovered and people started to travel again. According to various data points, Crocs seem to be selling like hot cakes.

See, for example, in what quantities they are sold on Amazon in the best sellers category(in many countries) or in other e-shops, or how often they are searched for according to Google Trends.  
America sets the trends. Crocs started their ‚Äúnew era‚Äù growth during the pandemic when people started buying them to make themselves happy and feel comfortable, and this growth has continued up to the present moment.

I think that the company will fully demonstrate potential in Europe and other countries in 2023/2024. It is clear from various data that it is happening. The trend has started accelerating this summer. Many countries in Europe and the rest of the world are two years behind

This growth is accelerated by the fact that travel is returning to normal and Crocs products will attract a lot of attention on the street, at the beach, at work, etc.

According to Google Trends, the search for ""crocs"" in Great Britain has exploded, and this trend is spreading. In many other countries, significant year-over-year growth in searches can be seen.

I think that the company will fully demonstrate potential in Europe and other countries in 2023/2024. It is clear from various data that it is happening. The trend has started accelerating this summer. Many countries in Europe and the rest of the world are two years behind   


 This growth is accelerated by the fact that travel is returning to normal and Crocs products will attract a lot of attention on the street, at the beach, at work, etc.  


According to Google Trends, the search for ""crocs"" in Great Britain has exploded, and this trend is spreading. In many other countries, significant year-over-year growth in searches can be seen.  
What shoes do you think kids and their peers will want for the new school year (back to the school season)?  


Which stock do you think their parents and many investors will buy in September, the moment they realize (after the summer holidays) how many people wear Crocs products?  


HeyDude was an expensive acquisition. However, HeyDude is basically a more elegant version of Crocs. The shoes have an unlimited number of designs as well, and the moment Crocs uses all its know-how for marketing and distribution, the Hey Dude brand will grow fast. #heydude

I understand most all the differences between the two options (thanks google), just can't understand why SPX options seem to appreciate so much more than SPY options on a given day.

I'm convinced they're not going to roll. Instead they're going to let the underlying get called away. Leaving the callers to hold the bag.

I don't think it's going to be their full position. They'll unload part of the options against dealer positions. They'll probably roll some. The rest will be assigned to the counterparty. If they need a reason, it's ""redemptions"".

What I think is there will be an assignment at 4100 of ~5% of the market to clueless counterparties that will immediately sell.

537,1659041908,wal4hd,1,"# From Zero to Everything

Amazon.com, Inc. (‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù) went from zero to one *everything* ‚Äì starting as a simple online bookstore in the 1990s, every piece of the puzzle seemed to fall into place over the years to create the $1+ trillion leader in ecommerce, cloud, and ecommerce channel advertising we know today, *the everything store.*

Amazon is a company like no other. It was a technology company when nobody saw it, believed it, or even *thought* it. On the surface, it was just an online bookstore. Deep down, it knew its opportunities were endless. It pioneered *cloud computing* with AWS, created the greatest online shopping experience based on *price, selection*, and *convenience*, and designed the market-leading Kindle eBook readers. Today, Amazon sees no limits ‚Äì it operates in streaming, advertising, cloud computing, ecommerce, physical stores, consumer goods, publishing, and *more*.

# Where Are We Now

 It is still *Day One* at Amazon today. Growth in Prime users is strong and same-day/one-day delivery may soon be a reality for many products in most cities. Amazon has also been making strides in areas outside of e-commerce ‚Äì cloud services, gaming, entertainment, and advertising, among others.

Amazon has been investing heavily at the expense of its free cash flow. Management indicated 40% of capital expenditures are feeding infrastructure (mostly the fast-growing AWS), 30% is fulfillment capacity, and the balance is mainly transportation capacity.

Amazon's Q1 2022 earnings report could prove to be an inflection point for the company in either direction. This was largely a mixed report - we report our ""ugly"", ""bad"", and ""good"" notes below.

* **The Ugly:** Operating profit fell 41% for the trailing twelve months that ended Q1 2022, free cash flow decreased to a total loss of about $18 billion, and there was also a net loss of $3.8 billion in Q1 2022. However, the net loss included a $7.6 billion valuation loss on Amazon's Rivian holdings. After backing this effect out, net profit would have been $3.8 billion.
* **The Bad:** The North America and International segments faced heightened costs leading operating margins to fall in these segments to (2.3%) and (4.5%) in Q1 2022, respectively. Amazon has not yet been able to scale back on costs and instead has been ramping them up. Revenue growth was also dire in both segments, growing 8% and 0%, respectively, vs. Q1 2021. Advertising services, subscription services, online stores, and third-party seller services all saw drastic deceleration in their year-over-year growth rates to 25%, 13%, (1%), and 9%, respectively, in Q1 2022. Much of this deceleration is because of Amazon's results lapping extraordinarily strong performance in early 2021.
* **The Good:** investors are now sending a clear signal to management that cost control needs to happen, and soon. Fortunately, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated, ""today, as we're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network"". Costs may scale back soon, but we think some patience will be required on the part of investors. Amazon is large, and costs simply cannot be scaled back overnight. Additionally, AWS is still growing rapidly, recording 37% year-over-year growth. On top of that, it recorded record operating margins of 35% in Q1 2022. We think this is a great sign of the wonderful underlying economics of the AWS business and its strength. Long-term, revenue growth and high margins should result in AWS being the largest growth driver for the company.

Overall, we understand the frustration investors feel with Amazon reporting what are clearly poor financial results. However, with a long-term mindset and more patience than ever, we continue to believe Amazon's investments over the last two years and lead in cloud will prove to be strong growth sources.

# Investment Thesis

Amazon was, is, and will always be a company that puts the customer first. By dialing in on fostering exceptional customer experiences and value, the company kickstarted a never-ending virtuous cycle that started from the very first customer and continues to benefit every customer to this very day.

1. Amazon is a global technology conglomerate that generates revenues from six major areas - Online Stores, AWS, Third-Party Selling Services (‚Äú3PSS‚Äù), Subscriptions, Physical Stores, and Other (mainly advertising). The company has over 200 million Prime subscribers, almost 500 million square feet of real estate to drive its operations, and it is hungry for more.
2. Amazon has one of the widest moats across its main offerings ‚Äì ecommerce, cloud computing, and advertising. The virtuous cycle that begins and ends with the customer is the source of high switching costs, powerful network effects, cost advantages, high barriers to entry, and a reputable brand name.
3. Amazon faces potential risks with Jeff Bezos stepping down as CEO, antitrust concerns posing a perpetual threat, Microsoft Azure gaining ground in the cloud market, margin pressure from growth investments, and competition from incumbents across many saturated markets.
4. Secular industry tailwinds and competitive advantages in ecommerce, cloud computing, and advertising will buoy Amazon‚Äôs financial and competitive position throughout this decade *at a minimum*.
5. Growth and reinvestment opportunities are vast, laying the groundwork for a long growth runway.

# Competitive Advantages

One of the most profound concepts fostered by Amazon is the idea of a ‚Äúvirtuous cycle‚Äù focused on the customer. At Amazon, every move begins and ends with the customer in mind.

The result is exceptional customer experience, which leads to more traffic and product reviews, attracting more sellers, thus contributing to a greater selection across all product categories. The result? Improved customer experience, which kicks off the virtuous cycle all over again.

The virtuous cycle inherently explains the impact of a **network effect** ‚Äì by uniquely focusing mainly on the customer, sellers experience more interest and sales in their products as customers return to Amazon.com for their shopping. As the customer base grows, so do sellers and their product selection, and vice versa.

AWS is the most widely known and used cloud platform in the world, and Amazon‚Äôs advertising segment is gaining ground at a rapid pace. AWS and both sponsored and non-sponsored advertising benefit from network effects.

The former benefits from a vast user base of some of the largest enterprises in the world, increasing the likelihood that other organizations searching for a cloud platform will choose AWS.

Additionally, AWS improves as more users initiate usage of the platform, collecting data from many customers to create a more effective suite of cloud services and innovate in and around the AWS ecosystem to provide an ever-growing number of services to meet organizational needs.

Currently, AWS offers over 200 fully featured services across the ecosystem, the most depth and breadth of services out of any of the major three cloud providers (i.e., AWS, Azure, GCP). The latter benefits from network effects in two distinct ways ‚Äì companies using sponsored advertising benefit from the large (and growing) Amazon customer base to drive sales, and those on non-sponsored advertising solutions benefit from a combination of data-driven programmatic advertising and popular Amazon media platforms, which are flush with users.

Stemming from the aforementioned network effects are **cost advantages, high barriers to entry**, and the benefit of a global and highly reputable **brand name**. In other words, these moat characteristics are all interconnected - Amazon wins because it can offer products at a lower price than almost any company in the world, which gives it its scale, a deterrent of competition in and of itself.

According to Evercore, over 80% of Amazon customers in their survey are either ‚Äúvery satisfied‚Äù or ‚Äúextremely satisfied‚Äù with Amazon, alluding to the fact that the company puts the customer first.

This is an unattainable feat for virtually any company in the universe. We believe these factors contribute to the reputable brand name of Amazon, which in turn helps drive adoption of other services, like AWS and advertising.

Although it may seem that products and services sold on Amazon.com have low switching costs given the plethora of other ecommerce websites and streaming services available to consumers, we believe consumers face **high switching costs** when considering the power of the selection-price-convenience trifecta. For the roughly 200 million Prime customers around the world, there is virtually no viable alternative that offers the variety of products for the low prices and free express shipping on millions of items.

At a cost of around $100 per year, Prime customers break even rather quickly considering the amount of shopping they do on the platform. **According to Evercore research, Prime customers spend 2 ‚Äì 3 times more money per month and shop twice as frequently as non-Prime customers**. Additionally, more than 75% of Prime customers purchase products 2 ‚Äì 3 times per month on Amazon.¬†

We believe this consumer behavior and the extremely attractive price point of a Prime membership for the value it offers (i.e., free one-day and two-day shipping, Prime video, unlimited music streaming, and Amazon Prime Reading) brings to light the strength of the trifecta and how unattractive single-store direct-to-consumer alternatives appear to be in comparison regarding price, selection, and convenience. **Why shop anywhere else when you‚Äôve got Amazon carrying most, if not** ***all*****, of your favorite products?**

AWS and Amazon Advertising should not be left out of the ‚Äúswitching costs‚Äù conversation. AWS customers may be reluctant to leave due to tangible and intangible costs as they relate to the following decision factors:

1. AWS provides the most services out of any cloud provider, making it rather unlikely that there is much benefit in a customer switching cloud providers.
2. Cloud functionality may be similar, but not quite the same between providers. It may cost lots of time and money to recalibrate processes, databases, and functionalities between cloud providers.
3. Cloud operations are massive ‚Äì it is unlikely internal organizational teams will be able to learn another cloud platform and its uses quickly enough to avoid business and operational interruptions.

Amazon Advertising customers looking to leave the platform would also face enormous direct and indirect costs. For one, sponsored ads are hosted on the largest ecommerce website on the planet ‚Äì what better place to advertise your product than a website where hundreds of millions of visitors are already shopping for products?

Further, Amazon‚Äôs non-sponsored advertising and demand-side platform (‚ÄúDSP‚Äù) programmatic advertising could provide a more compelling offering than other DSPs, such as The Trade Desk, given Amazon‚Äôs reach across proprietary sites and apps on top of third-party exchanges where many DSPs solely operate.

Advertisers on Amazon leverage the unimaginable power of Amazon consumer data to place effective and relevant ads across many platforms ‚Äì we believe most advertisers would face internal backlash and reluctance towards cutting off Amazon‚Äôs advertising services.

# Opportunities Ahead

* **Amazon is the best-positioned e-commerce platform, in our view.** The company keeps swallowing up distribution and fulfillment center space around the world. The company has a massive footprint and not many other retailers will be able to compete. In fact, we think Amazon will continue to reign as king in the market it created a bulletproof moat in. The company also has a massive lead in market share ‚Äì over 40% of total e-commerce sales are fulfilled through Amazon. In stark contrast, Walmart, Amazon‚Äôs main e-commerce competitor, holds less than 10% of the market. We believe this displays Amazon‚Äôs role in the market as the consumer‚Äôs top pick for online shopping.
* ***Advertising Services*** **is the fastest-growing segment at Amazon.** Roughly 90% of Amazon‚Äôs ad revenues are derived from e-commerce channel advertising, a niche Amazon had carved out for itself using its own e-commerce platform. We believe e-commerce is a strong secular trend, and advertisers will find value in placing ads on Amazon as advertisers look away from traditional media (i.e., print, magazines, TV, etc.) to areas where more eyeballs can be captured. Amazon is one such place as e-commerce penetration increases.
* **JPMorgan estimates that only 15% of workloads around the world are in the cloud, a far reach from where it can (and should) be.** There are many advantages to shifting from on-premises locations onto the cloud ‚Äì lower IT costs, almost infinite computing power, faster deployment, implementation, and scalability. In a decade when 5G, the Internet of Things, edge computing, and growing data consumption will change how the world looks today, it should come with no surprise that outsourced cloud adoption is expected to accelerate exponentially. AWS benefits from first-mover advantage and the breadth and depth of its 200+ services provided on the platform. It controls almost 60% of the infrastructure-as-a-service (‚ÄúIaaS‚Äù) and platform-as-a-service (‚ÄúPaaS‚Äù) combined market, ahead of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform at 34% and 8% market share, respectively. Although Microsoft leverages its reputation among the corporate community to provide organizations with a full and convenient IaaS, PaaS, and software-as-a-service (‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù) suite of services to capture 50% of the overall cloud market share, Amazon leads where it matters most ‚Äì IaaS and PaaS, which will both experience growth of over 25% through 2024 while SaaS grows at about half the CAGR. **We believe AWS will maintain its lead and continue to capture a significant portion of the growing TAM** for the following reasons:  


1. AWS has significantly more services, features within those services, and the deepest functionality within those services than any other cloud provider.
2. AWS has the strongest reputation and largest network of users among the top three cloud providers. The AWS Partner Network (‚ÄúAPN‚Äù) is robust and fosters a community of partners that build AWS-derived solutions for sale through the platform. More than 90% of Fortune 100 companies and most of the Fortune 500 companies use the APN.
3. AWS has the longest track record of operational expertise as the longest serving cloud provider while consistently growing and maintaining the first-place spot in the IaaS / PaaS market.
4. AWS has the largest network of global cloud infrastructure, playing into the technological trends which can only be enabled with low latency and massive computing power.

* **Amazon's Prime membership is, quite frankly, one of the best consumer value propositions out there today**. The service varies in pricing by country. Using the US Amazon Prime membership as a proxy, the membership only costs $139 per year, or $14.99 per month. Considering all [these benefits](https://www.amazon.com/primeinsider/about), anyone interested in a Prime membership for any purpose is likely to find high value in many of the other perks. For example, someone who would like a Prime Video membership can pay a few dollars more each month to gain access to everything else. On the delivery side, the payback period for a year's worth of Prime is extremely short ‚Äî depending how much one values their time, it could pay off within a few orders. At most, it will pay off after about 14 orders in a year, assuming one-day delivery costs $10 per order, on average. It's easy to rack up more than 14 orders per year. In fact, the average Prime member orders 24 times each year and for an average total of $1,400. Think about it ‚Äî everyday items, like shampoo or deodorant, and gifts, gadgets and accessories, non-perishable food items, grocery and prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and health goods, and plenty more are purchased many times throughout the year. The average Prime member actually saves money and our most value asset, time, and gets everything else ‚Äî Prime Video, Music, Reading, Photo Storage, etc. ‚Äî for free.
* **Amazon is pulling the optionality levers available to the company.** Amazon recently closed on its $8.5-billion acquisition of MGM, which opens up a catalogue of over 4,000 movies and 17,000 shows, including James Bond and the Rocky franchises. More important than the existing catalogue is the intellectual property at MGM that will help Amazon beef up its content on Prime Video. Outside of Prime Video, Amazon is dabbling with luxury stores, physical pharmacy, Amazon Go, and plenty of other things we do not yet know about over the next 5 - 10 years.

# Risks

Amazon established a wide moat across several markets, but its moat does not protect it from all forces ‚Äì internal or exogenous. We believe the factors presented below represent some of the greatest risk to Amazon‚Äôs financial, operational, or competitive positions across all time frames:

* Amazon operates across many saturated markets and faces competition from well-established incumbents in each area (ex. Streaming ‚Äì Disney+ and Netflix; Physical Stores ‚Äì Costco and Walmart; 3PSS ‚Äì Etsy, eBay). Lack of focus, poor strategic moves, and dilutive mergers or acquisitions in any of its segments may result in lost market share and in more severe cases, a full exit from the segment.
* AWS competes mainly against Microsoft Azure, a cloud provider that has been growing faster than AWS and controls the overall cloud market due to its well-known business solutions and integrated IaaS-PaaS-SaaS platform. AWS‚Äôs lack of a complete suite of SaaS services, consumer industry reluctance of AWS adoption due to competition concerns, and Microsoft‚Äôs strong corporate relationships could result in Microsoft taking over AWS‚Äôs controlling position in the IaaS / PaaS market.
* Amazon‚Äôs sheer size raises constant antitrust scrutiny from governments around the world. The timing, severity, and outcome of these investigations are deeply uncertain and could result in Amazon being broken up into several smaller companies and depressed valuations if shareholders see fewer opportunities for growth in the future if this were to occur.
* Andy Jassy has taken over Jeff Bezos as CEO, presenting potential risks to the future of the company if the strategic course of the were to diverge dramatically from Bezos‚Äôs mission.
* Amazon is still in growth mode ‚Äì margin pressure will remain a risk in the short- and long-term.

I believe peoples still love to go cinema with their kids or girlfriend but someone usually goes alone as well.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

**Earnings per share (EPS): $1.21 vs $1.28 expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Revenue: $69.69 billion vs $69.9 billion expected, according to Refinitiv**

**YouTube advertising revenue: $7.34 billion vs. $7.52 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Google Cloud revenue: $6.28 billion vs. $6.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount.**

**Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $12.21 billion vs $12.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

Revenue growth slowed to 13% in the quarter from 62% a year earlier, when the company was benefiting from the post-pandemic reopening and consumer spending was on the rise.

Currency fluctuations from a strengthening dollar knocked 3.7 percentage points off revenue growth, CFO Ruth Porat told CNBC‚Äôs Deirdre Bosa. Porat said the strength of the dollar will hit next quarter‚Äôs results even harder.

Porat also characterized the current outlook as one of ‚Äúuncertainty in the global economic environment.‚Äù

Advertising revenue increased just 12% to $56.3 billion, as marketers reeled in their spending to manage inflationary pressures. The most notable deceleration was in the YouTube division, where sales rose 5% after jumping 84% in the same period a year ago.

Microsoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software maker issued a rosy income forecast for the year ahead, despite issuing quarterly results that failed to reach Wall Street consensus.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

**Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

**Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

Microsoft turned in the slowest revenue growth since 2020, at 12% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. The company‚Äôs earnings per share fell short of consensus for the first time since 2016, with net income rising 2% to $16.74 billion.

With respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $49.25 billion to $50.25 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue. The middle of the range, at $49.75 billion, implies about 10% revenue growth, reflecting worsening PC sales and slower cloud infrastructure growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected more, at $51.49 billion. The company‚Äôs implied gross margin, at 69.85%, was wider than the 69.30% consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.

And for the new 2023 fiscal year, the company reiterated its forecast from three months ago, despite the economic climate.

If snap can maintain the current revenue which shows a loss of .02 cents per share... and they cut back on expanding their operating costs; but also take their revenue and use it to buy back shares (which is what will happen) then I will HODL their shares for a long time..

Cutting cost, maintaining revenue, and decreasing the amount of shares on the market seems like a winning strategy to me for long-term growth.

2. Apple: $2.5 trillion in market cap
3. Alphabet: $1.43 trillion in market cap
4. Amazon: $1.25 trillion in market cap
5. Facebook: $0.458 trillion in market cap

Here are expectations for the companies:

**Microsoft, Earnings announcement Jul 26, 2022, after the market close:**

On Jul 8th Piper Sandler lowered Microsoft‚Äôs estimate due to foreign exchange headwinds from the persistently strong U.S. dollar.

It expects to report between $51.94 billion and $52.74 billion in revenues for the quarter. The company had previously forecast fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion.  
Microsoft also slightly cut its quarterly earnings forecast, saying it now expects to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $2.24 to $2.32. Previously, the company projected adjusted EPS between $2.28 and $2.35.

**Apple, Earnings announcement Jul 28, 2022, after the market close:**

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 12 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $1.13. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $1.3. Analysts expect Q3 revenue of $82.8 billion, up 1.7% YoY. Morgan Stanley said Apple could get back on track and hit $3 trillion on its services shift.

**Alphabet, Earnings announcement Jul 25, 2022, after the market close:**

Alphabet (GOOGL) missed top &amp; bottom line expectations in the last quarter due to a slowdown in the advertising market. Google expects to increase its revenues by 13.3% to $70.1 billion. EPS is expected to fall by 4.4% to $1.30.

 **Amazon, Earnings announcement Jul 28, 2022, after the market close:**

Amazon has been on a streak recently. The wrong kind of streak, though. Disappointing investors. Revenues are expected to grow 6% to reach $119.5 billion. EPS is expected to get crushed due to inflationary pressures. Of course, AWS will be on focus.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Facebook, Earnings announcement Jul 27, 2022, after the market close:**

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on ten analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.51. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $3.61. Revenue is also forecast to dip 0.2% to $29.0 billion due to weaker advertiser demand and lower ad prices on Facebook and Instagram.

Daily active users and monthly active users numbers will be in focus. Market participants will also pay attention to how much money Facebook is willing to spend on its reality labs segment.

**2. Macro Economic indicators**:

First, let‚Äôs start by saying that the macro picture is not looking good.

**A. PMI:**

Flash US PMI Composite Output Index registered 47.5 in July, down notably from 52.3 in June, to signal a solid contraction in private sector output. The rate of decline was the sharpest since the initial stages of the pandemic in May 2020, as both manufacturers and service providers reported subdued demand conditions.

**B. Philly Fed New Orders:**

Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is based on The Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in the Third Federal Reserve District. Participants report the direction of change in overall business activity and the various measures of activity at their plants: employment, working hours, new and unfilled orders, shipments, inventories, delivery times, prices paid, and prices received.

Philadelphia Fed said Thursday [its gauge of regional business activity](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/manufacturing-business-outlook-survey) dropped to negative 12.3 in July from negative 3.3 in the prior month.

Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal expected a 1.6 reading.

Any reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions in the manufacturing sector. This is the second straight month in contraction territory.

**C. Dr. Copper**:

Copper (The commodity) predicts turning points in global economic cycles. The reason for that is because Copper is used in almost every sector. Demand for Copper is a reliable leading indicator of economic health. How do you gauge the demand? By looking at the price of Copper. Rising Copper prices indicate that demand for the commodity is strong, hence, a growing global economy. A decline in prices suggests the opposite. Copper had fallen into a bear market in the run-up to each of the last four recessions dating back to 1990, as the chart below shows.¬†Copper fell into a bear market from its peak (-24%) in May 2021.

 **D. Inverted Yield Curve** 

The yield curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the San Francisco Fed. And yes, the yield curve is inverted. 

 **3. Federal Reserve Rate hikes, inflation, and expectations:**

Currently, it seems like the Fed will stick to a 75 bps rate hike in July. In June inflation print was 9.1%, hitting 40 year high. Expectations were that the Fed would become more aggressive and hike rates by 100 bps (1%). Hawkish Fed members are supporting a 75 bps hike and not 100 bps.

 **4. GDP Release:**

Gross Domestic Product will be released Thursday, July 28, 2022. Economists were expecting the U.S. economy to fall into recession somewhere in 2023. On July 1st, the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker showed that the U.S. economy might already be in a recession. The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs GDPNow gauge sees the second quarter at a negative 2.1%. Coupled with the first quarter‚Äôs decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession.",The most important week of 2022.,1.0,2022-07-24 05:29:12

**When should I close my Puts I opened?**

If we look at the trend‚Ä¶ regardless of what SPY does AFTER FOMC‚Ä¶ it is ALWAYS best to close Tuesday before EOD. Close the puts EOD before FOMC‚Ä¶ save some BP and then buy a put for the next drop.

This FOMC will be even more juicy to buy overnight puts (may I recommend SPX 0dte here‚Ä¶) because despite 3 of the four last FOMCs opening red the next day‚Ä¶ granted only one of these was anything significant. Three of the last four FOMCs the following day has been red and the last two have both been -3%+ red days. This FOMC is special because the following day we get the q2 GDP reading‚Ä¶ why does this matter? Because this would be our SECOND negative reading in a row and that would mean we are 100% in a recession‚Ä¶ we should expect at minimum a -1 to -1.5% open Thursday morning. Now will markets dump or will they rip like after CPI? That part im not sure just yet on‚Ä¶ we also have Amazon, Ford, boeing, Ford, Meta and pinterest the day of FOMC‚Ä¶ this can be a hella big bearish catalyst especially if Google and MSFT have bad earning Monday/ Tuesday.

**How markets have played out at 2pm the last 4 FOMC meetings**

Now for January we didn‚Äôt have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets‚Ä¶ so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don‚Äôt really equate this January one to much since there was no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. (initial run up till 210, dropped under 220 and then peaked at 230, dropped at 235, retested 230pm high at 240 and then by 245pm was breaking the 230 lows‚Ä¶ from there we sold off until 250pm. Rested and then sold off the rest of the way at until 310pm when the bottom was in). 

March 16th FOMC we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. (235pm bottom is in but retested at 240pm).

May 4th FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji‚Ä¶ JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (bottom was put in at 235pm) 

June 15th FOMC We got the initial pop of green that was followed by a sell off. By 230pm when JPOW spoke we had found the bottom and from there we ran for 15minutes. This was the first FOMC though where at 245pm we saw a major pullback to where the 2pm candle opened before it then pushed green again to make a new HOD by 345pm. (bottom was put in at 235pm)

&amp;#x200B;

**How I plan to trade FOMC**

How do we play this? Well assuming this is going to behave similar to the March, May and June FOMCs we are going to take the opening price at 2pm and look for a 1% drop. So lets saw we open at 390. That means are BUY target is 386.1. Now the trick with this is PATIENCE! We CAN NOT fomo in and we CAN NOT get nervous here. The timing HAS to be perfect here‚Ä¶ too early and youll get IV crushed (most likely will still get paid crazy good). The other thing that we have to be careful of is the wildcard market just dumps like January. The one thing I will say is that the January FOMC meeting was a wildcard and the market is much more understanding of FOMC than it was before in January. So I do think we will behave more like March, May and June especially. 

Okay so its now 235pm and we have our 1% drop at 386.1‚Ä¶ this is where its dealers choice you can either buy say a 3-5OTM CALL or you can just stick with the try and trued ATM call. We are expecting nearly a 2.8% on average pop here‚Ä¶ now of course that‚Äôs basically if you timed it perfectly top and bottom. For me I would safely set a 100% profit order if you entered anywhere remotely close to that 1% drop range and let it ride. You could set a 50% STOP LIMIT order once it gets closer to 100% and then just let it run till at least 245pm before closing it. 

The safest way though is to enter and immediately set a 100% take profit order. To be safe you could set a 50% sell order instead.  

The one thing to note here is that from 215 to 230pm there biggest IV crush happens along with the biggest fall usually and that is why you have to be careful. 

For those of you who wanna be aggressive AF‚Ä¶ another play here‚Ä¶ and mind you this one is the highest risk of them all‚Ä¶ would be to take 0.5% from the 2pm OPEN price so lets use 390 again‚Ä¶ 391.9 would be target‚Ä¶ once that level is hit enter an ATM put‚Ä¶. And then ride that down 1% from the 2pm candle OPEN. So that would be down to 386.1‚Ä¶ This method should net you a nice 50%. But this one is way riskier as you are exposed to IV crush and the way from the top to the bottom of 2pm to 215pm is wild and full of bounces and fake outs. This ones not for the faint of heart. 

**What if im wrong?**

Okay what is the wild card here? What if I am wrong? What do we look for‚Ä¶ im glad you asked! So with January the pattern was different. Now mind you January was a completely different time in the markets as they had ‚Äúno idea‚Äù what was to come and this was the first inflation shit the bed news, etc. etc. 

So with January we saw the spike at 2pm followed by a small sell off. The 215pm candle then just held within the 2pm candle which is key to watch for. We then saw that 230pm (when JPOW starts presser) was the peak and from there we basically started dumping. This will be key to watch for. If we aren‚Äôt seeing the Up -&gt; down -&gt; bigger up pattern started and come 230/235 we aren‚Äôt seeing the pattern making a bottom we need to be prepared to play a put instead. From 230 to 245 we dumped lower and then that 245 candle dumped us all the way until 245. Keep and eye on the candle bodies. If the candle bodies are looking weak and we aren‚Äôt seeing big wicks to the downside then we might get the dump like this. 

What could cause a dump like this? Well it depends what we see from the media this week and Monday/ Tuesday. The fed now is basically telling us we are getting 75bps hike and nothing matters. They said that 100bps hike wont help and doesn‚Äôt matter. We are essentially expecting a 75bps hike so if we get surprised with a 100bps hike AND JPOW throws some sort of wild card at us we might see a dump like this. 

The other wildcard which some are saying ‚Äúhow can you be so bearish for FOMC‚Ä¶ the markets already expects rates, etc. etc. etc.‚Äù To this I do agree and this is where I say despite things being priced in‚Ä¶ they are only priced in until the markets/ algos hear and see those numbers live. They its officially priced in. 

Someone else and other I am hearing mention that the fed may actually hint to a pausing of rate hikes from here on out and maybe even at Wednesday meeting‚Ä¶ why? Because big tech is already doing hiring freezes and the big techs are already showing that stuff is easing‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt 100% make sense to me but I do see some peoples logic with it. 

So if we are under the impression we are priced in then we need to be prepared that at 2pm till EOD we just rip on FOMC giving us ‚Äúgood‚Äù news‚Ä¶ aka not badder than expected news‚Ä¶

For this type of ‚Äúgood news FOMC‚Äù we gotta go back to December 15th and November 3rd 2021. 

If we are expecting bull run during FOMC we will look for a large 2pm to 230pm pop‚Ä¶ large then the normal 0.5% fake pop‚Ä¶ but the KEY would be that we see a small retracement leading to 230 presser starting but we do NOT break below the 2pm candles low. If this is what we are getting that magical 235pm time is still the best buy time. 

It is key to watch how the candles move and interact with eachother‚Ä¶ and either way you HAVE to be patient‚Ä¶ 235pm regardless seems to be the magical buy time‚Ä¶ and almost all scenarios 235pm is the CALL buy opportunity‚Ä¶ only 1 meeting in the last 8 meetings was it an actual put buying opportunity.",The only FOMC week TA/ DD you'll ever need to read,1.0,2022-07-22 20:10:59

Something extremely interesting about this week before FOMC is that this is the first week since the November 2021 FOMC meeting that SPY has had a green week proceeding the FOMC meeting. So that‚Äôs only 1 other time in the last 6 meetings we have seen that‚Ä¶ interesting to say the least. This is also the lowest the VIX has been the week before FOMC since January. 

What does this mean? I am not sure‚Ä¶ but the sentiment right now is clearly very bullish but I think that we are about to see this change. The steam has been slowly fading.

Kind of an interesting case here on the daily. At open today we had already broken the week+ long support line. This means that the rising wedge you see what and is broken. So that SHOULD be a sign of a drop that is coming. I am looking at that red resistance line and the last 4 candles on spy have hit it‚Ä¶ today came very close to hitting it but did not have enough momentum to hit its 400 target. 

This candle is a hammer candle on paper which could signal a top.

ES futures perfectly rejected the 4005 resistance line. We have not however, seen ES futures break down out of its rising wedge but we are seeing that tomorrow and overnight this 4005 resistance level is going to be key. My expectations is ES will retest 4005 perhaps even the red dotted line at 4015 before it rejects and falls out of the rising wedge with support at 3945.

I wanted to draw some attention to Apples Daily chart. Apple has been in my opinion carrying this whole last month of movement upward. Today we saw a confirmed hammer candle on the daily and the last time we had a candle like this was May 17th which led to a massive gap down and a massive red day. You can see the last two days on Apple the volume has significantly dropped off which tells me that the buying momentum has faded and we should and could be seeing the top put in right now. 

Bull case- 

Despite a spotty morning we were able to back test 392.3 support and make it through the morning Biden Covid news. Despite the rising wedge breaking we are still making higher highs and higher lows since July 14th. Markets are still quickly pricing in all news. The weekly just saw a major resistance line broken and now with the June 9th gap only $2.60 away it is a natural expectation that this will be filled tomorrow as it is within reach. The bulls have clearly been in control all week with every dip being a CALL buying opportunity. 

Bulls will look to gap fill 401.5 and break through resistance at 402.4. From there it looks to continue its bullish momentum as we head into next week where bulls will look to reach the top of the rising wedge at 415 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

Bear case (this is where im leaning)-

This is the first earnings that really has shaken up the market. Now SNAPCHAT does not have a huge stake in the market BUT you can see everyone is being hit by it now. A little odd thing is that last earnings seasons SNAP report on April 21st and that was what proceeded a major sell off going into FOMC the next week‚Ä¶ April 21st was the top after SNAP reports and today is looking to be the top after SNAP reported and FOMC next week‚Ä¶ coincidence? Probably‚Ä¶ but weird‚Ä¶ okay back to TA‚Ä¶

Despite the bullish momentum today we saw that the support line that has been carrying spy fell today. We have now broken out of the rising wedge and that naturally should signal a top. The bulls for two days straight now have had an opportunity to reach 401.5 to gap fill yet have failed time and time again. Intraday the last two days we have seen some pretty heavy sell offs and sell pressure, however, at this momentum for now its been eaten up by the bulls.

With this hammer candle on Apple and Spy and an overall decrease in the volume on SPY, with 4 of the last 5 days being green (3 green in a row) and the weekend ahead it is a natural expectation that we see a red day tomorrow. With the weekend ahead and snap now missing earnings hugely and not giving guidance we should see people start to position themselves for the rest of big tech next week and FOMC next week. 

Bears will look to break down that 

If by some miracle the bulls can keep this momentum up tomorrow and they can take this to the gap fill and even that 403 level I mentioned I would be surprised. 392.5 and attempt to close SPY back under the daily 8ema which is currently at 389.5. A closure back under the daily 50 and 8ema would be a very bearish turn for the markets and would give a nice hint of bearishness heading into FOMC next week. 

10% challenge-

Today I did not make any day trades. My expectations were a range day and this morning movement was anything but normal. We had once again some major 0.5% candles and saw at times Spy moving up and down but 50 cents at a time. When the Biden covid news hit I was ready to take a short but knew that this could be the over reaction. Despite increasing sell pressure I waited and it paid off. Around 2pm when I saw how strong 397.3 resistance was holding up I did scale into a 1dte and 6dte put position. I had plans to scale in further EOD but with us so close to the gap fill I wanted to be cautious and knew that theta would eat me up overnight either way. 

My plan is to see where we open the 1dte has a break even (currently with no expected IV pump on a dump) of 394. There is a pretty big case that we could see a -1% or lower opening. With the dump right at close my average down only brought my breakeven close by $1 so the risk to reward was not there for me. If we open green and look to be going for gap fill I will consider averaging down there if I suspect an EOD sell off. If we open big red I will most likely just let it ride as If we are red I suspect a bigger sell off. 

The 6dte I wanted to scale into and hold this till Tuesday night. I suspect that we are going to see a pretty large sell off tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday especially. I will look to average down if we gap fill this otherwise I will consider adding to this in the morning. I most likely will take profits EOD and then open a new position for next week depending on what tomorrow brings. This 6dte has about the same breakeven without pump near 394.5. 

Not going to lie after a rough week of trading for me it felt kind of nice not playing anything and just watching it. The momentum was spotty at times. I never felt like the bulls had me convinced we were going to run like that EOD. I also have not been a fan of trading over the probable IV highs/ lows and we once again hit the improbable IV high.

People love to talk about the **""tight job market""** and how unemployment rates are still incredibly low. Don't expect that to last. It won't. As JPOW continues to hike up interest rates, the death spiral will start. More and more companies will have mass layoffs. Unemployment rate will go up higher than most people will expect. People who can't even imagine losing their jobs will lose their jobs. Just like these 8000 salaried Ford employees didn't expect to lose their jobs but they did anyway.

What does this mean for regular everyday Americans. Well, apart from the fact that finding a job will become harder than it is now, the housing market may collapse as well. If millions of Americans are laid off, then you can't expect them to continue making their monthly mortgage payments. Foreclosures will rise sharply.

591,1658374782,w46aow,1," So what kind of coked out adderall overdose made me go bold with this prediction of imminent doom when the market has been doing uppies all week? It's pretty simple. Next Wednesday is FOMC where we're either going to get a .75bp rate hike, in which case the market does its usual rocket ship after the meeting, or we get a surprise 1.00bp hike and things probably tank after the meeting. Then on Thursday we have the Q2 GDP numbers come out confirming we're officially in a recession. (a fact I called last October btw, it just took a couple months for the data to catch up) The real action though is in the Thursday after hours Earnings Reports. Specifically, the ERs for two of the biggest companies on the planet, both of which I expect to fail spectacularly.

Apple and Amazon.

Just in general I think both of these stocks are wildly overvalued (I have a fair price target of $20-25 on AMZN and $50 on AAPL) Amazon has a PE of 60, which is so absurd on multiple levels that I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's dumb. Apple has a PE of 25, which, again, is too high.

I think both companies are going to get absolutely annihilated on ER, and when they do, they'll drag the entire market down with them. Now, why I am I so sure both companies will have bad ERs?

For Amazon, it's really easy, their current post Bezos leadership is actually a bunch of ferrets piled on top of each other in trenchcoats, they wildly overexpanded during the pandemic, and as people go outside again, they're not loading up on orders. Also, Prime Day was a bust, and AWS continues to no longer enjoy exclusive rights to the cloud services space as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and more expand into it.

For Apple, they're basically in the same situation as Amazon was last ER, where they had a complete dumpster fire of an ER previously, but papered over it with nonsense - in Apple's case that was refusing to provide guidance for their #1 market and home of 100% of their assemblies - China.

So, to recap, on 7/27, you're going to have a FED rate hike, then on 7/28 you're going to see headlines screaming about how we're officially in recession all day, then that night you'll see two of the biggest pillars of the market report dumpster fire earnings.

So I just scrapped my 21 year old pickup after the motor blew. I'm gonna spend $200 on this lotto play. I've put in $100 so far, I'll throw in the other Benji sometime between Friday and Tuesday.

Normally this would be flared as a yoyololo, but I'm not putting nearly as much $$ on this as required by sub rules, so I guess meme since I'm not including enough info for a real DD post? But if you need evidence of conviction, my house has a 30-year fixed 2% mortgage, and I'm currently selling it to go live in my buddies basement to try and front-run the real estate collapse - I'm probably too late, but we'll see!

**TLDR: Black Friday next week (maybe, but maybe not, I'm only putting $200 on this)**

As far as an update on my food shortage play, I'm now up to 20 1/23 calls on W3AT and 5 11/18 calls on S0YB, I just keep buying that sweet dip. Once I get enough S0YB calls I'll be adding some C0RN as well.

595,1658279393,w391lk,1,"Pinterest recently got a uptick on the stock with an investment firm buying 9% of the stock with plans to monetize the platform better in international markets.

Pinterest is a garbage platform going into the future - worse than twitter - possibly worse than Reddit. 

Pinterest users do not convert (I‚Äôve spent 5 figures on Pinterest testing the platform) I‚Äôve talked closet with their ad executives and reps over periods of months via phone conferences etc. 

Mainly them trying to get us to light more money on fire on their platform. Even though the products we were selling should of been ‚Äúno brainers‚Äù to sell on Pinterest. 

Pinterest drives a substantial or massive amount of their traffic from Google images. All you have to do is browse Reddit to hear the lamentations of people trying to find images on Google and ending up on shitbox Pinterest being forced to make an account or login. 

Pinterest HEAVILY relies on Google images which at any moment - could be slapped and lose their dominance on Google image search. This would be pretty devastating to Pinterest. With the amount of people who hate Pinterest showing up on every Google image search - I could see this happening eventually. 

I can only imagine a monster percentage of their 450m users are griefed into signing up on the platform in order to access the image they were trying to get off Google images. This would possibly indicate a lot of inactive or unengaged users. 

User behavior on Pinterest is low value. Most users on Pinterest are just browsing and collecting garbage DIY pins. Pinterest ad platform charges advertisers every time someone ‚Äúenlarges a pin.‚Äù No, not when they actually click to visit your website. Most clicks we did get to the site had virtually zero on site time (accidental clicks, rummaging clicks.) additionally Pinterest has lots of bots going around ‚Äúcollecting pins‚Äù for their boards and theoretically costing ad spend by enlarging the pin. 

People going through a Pinterest feed which is literally all god damn spam of various products they open and close crap incessantly with very little ‚Äúbuying intent.‚Äù The Pinterest wall looks like phone pole layered with spam flyers. 

I do not believe in Pinterest continued growth or success at all. Take a look at how bad the stock has bottomed out over the last couple of years. 

Their ad team sells their ads by saying ohhhh this is a long buying cycle. Pinterest users see ads and come back months later and buy it. Yeah, no. Ad companies that say this usually say that because their ads don‚Äôt perform and they want you to drop $50k in ads upfront without seeing any profit. 

I don‚Äôt see Pinterest as a viable future oriented social media network nor one that can expand truly on its monetization.",I‚Äôm going to short Pinterest in the near future - here‚Äôs why,1.0,2022-07-20 01:09:53

Bulls ended up protecting the gap. SPY gapped up and didn‚Äôt look back - leaving bears in the dust - and closed at 392.27 (also high of day). I did think that we would see a technical bounce and then continue downwards - but that didn‚Äôt happen today!

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks surged in a broad-based rally as investors assessed the earnings outlook and speculation grew that markets were on the verge of bottoming out.

The S&amp;P 500 defied the late-day reversal that has been a hallmark of this volatile market, closing near session highs and posting its biggest one-day gain since June 24th as all 11 industry groups advanced. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 outperformed major benchmarks, finishing 3.1% higher, with megacaps Apple and Google recouping losses from Monday.

With the possibility of earnings disappointment baked into markets, any positive surprises may result in outsized gains. According to the latest Bank of America Monthly Fund Manager Survey, investors are on high alert for signs that high inflation and monetary tightening are squeezing consumers and employment, with allocation to stocks plunging to levels last seen in October 2008 and exposure to cash surging to the highest since 2001.

## Rectangle - Neutral Bias

#### 7/19 UPDATE: SPY broke out of the 391 resistance. I am adding an additional resistance line that I missed at 395.77.

L*evels to keep an eye on:*

* *Rectangle Support: 370.19*
* *Rectangle Resistance: 391.12;* ***395.77***
* *Rectangle Middle: 380.31*
* *Anchored VWAP: 384.57*
* *Rectangle Break Tier 1 Upside Zone: 401.47 - 406.02*
* *Rectangle Break Tier 2 Upside Zone: 411.74 - 417.44*
* *Rectangle Break Tier 1 Downside Zone: 363.36 - 360.14*
* *Rectangle Break Tier 2 Downside Zone: 354.02 - 348.75*

## Where are we on the Chart?

SPY broke out of the triangle to the upside üò≤. Spy does have a gap to fill that may act as resistance (395.77 - 401.45) so keep an eye on those levels.

https://preview.redd.it/9k7js36iolc91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3522abb7e68d4b073d9687995a197a97e38d7a8a

If SPY can fill that gap and establish support, it has an opportunity to run. Here are some additional upside targets to note. If SPY finds strong resistance, I expect another test at 391.05 and then, possibly 380-379.

* Gap fill: 395.77 - 401.45
* Upside targets: 409.87 - 417.44; 426.64
* Short term support: 391.05
* Minor support: 391.05
* Major support: 380.54 - 379.05

When interest rates are high, companies that don't require a lot of capital to get their revenue do much better (companies like google, facebook who don't give a shit because they don't have big expenses to run your ads on an already built software)

While there might be some overlap here with the pet rock boomers, at least this rock does something useful, and it's time for it to shine again. The uranium sector is poised to explode out of the overall bear market thanks to a confluence of geopolitical reasons, and plain old supply and demand. Last time uranium was popular on WSB Pelaton and CRSR were also hot tickers. If you bought those bags, you should have gotten U bags instead since uranium actually has utility and is **still structurally under-invested**, just as most of the energy sector was revealed to be with the start of the Ukraine-Russia War.

You may have seen my last DD on uranium on this board almost a year ago when I thought the uranium market was coming out of the doldrums. That post immediately preceded a massive 200% rise in the underlying stocks until it popped in November ‚Äô21 like so many other risk on trades, before rising to even higher and highs in Q1 '22. I think we‚Äôre at that point again with uranium on the launchpad and standing by, but waiting for the fuse to be lit.

Read the last thread for a handle on the basic thesis and the supply deficit that the uranium market finds itself in: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg2pdy/uranium\_start\_of\_a\_commodity\_supercycle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg2pdy/uranium_start_of_a_commodity_supercycle/)

* TLDR:
* Uranium has been a structural deficit for years, exacerbated by COVID and now the energy crisis/Russia sanctions 
* Globalization is giving way to onshoring and friendshoring of commodities, even at increased costs, as having ready energy stores is now a matter of domestic security
* Uranium beat the rush and collapsed early in 2022 (and hard) and is emerging from its bear market.
* DoE started buying US-mined uranium for a brand new uranium strategic reserve last month
* DoE is contracting for enriched uranium to be produced domestically (currently, 100% of US enriched uranium is from foreign owned companies, with much of that being Russia)
* EU finally classified nuclear power as green last month, paving the way for investment that otherwise would have been barred from holding nuclear-related equities
* Whitehouse is pushing for a 4.3B package aimed at greatly expanding domestic mining and enrichment. That is a large number for such a small sector.

**1. Why Now?** Geopolitical risk is forcing onshoring of supply chains

The thesis has only gotten stronger since last year. We now live in a world of energy scarcity with riots in Sri Lanka as they can‚Äôt import fuel, and analysts struggling to determine how much firewood Germans will use this winter when the gas never turns back on next week. This coming winter is going to be quite a wakeup call for the world, but countries around the world are already backtracking on planned nuclear power plant closures and instead talking about, or even initiating, construction of new ones. SWU (enriched U) prices are at record highs as utilities purchase these in advance, plus most enriched uranium comes from Russia and while it isn‚Äôt banned yet, it is likely just a matter of time. The US can‚Äôt ban it yet as there is no domestic US-based enrichment available of the necessary scale. Despite the record highs for SWUs, raw uranium is only trading in the middle of its recent price range ($46) and uranium prospectors and miners along with it. Once all of the available SWUs are gobbled up, utilities will need to move their contracting down and uranium spot will move up past $60 as it was earlier this year, and miners should move back to cycle highs with it (up around 100-150% from current prices). Across the pond, the EU finally has voted to acknowledge uranium as green.

Lastly, if energy isn‚Äôt already on everyone‚Äôs minds, then it certainly will be if Gazprom doesn‚Äôt turn back on Nordstream 1 when it is supposed to come out of scheduled maintenance on July 22nd. Gazprom is already issuing press releases saying they can‚Äôt ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù any outcome of this maintenance. Russia could do the same thing to the US‚Äô supply of enriched uranium which currently supplies 19% of our total electric power. It‚Äôs a massive threat, and I can only assume utilities are trying to carry as much inventory as possible after a back door conversation with the government. Would you turn it back on if you were Putin?

**2. Why Now Part II?** DoE nuclear conference &amp; DoE contracting in U-space

Like last time, I think uranium is poised to absolutely scream out of this bear market and is simply waiting for the final catalyst. Next Monday and Tuesday the Department of Energy is hosting a nuclear conference, and it seems quite possible that the plan to domestically produce and enrich uranium in the US will be announced, which will pave the way for eventual uranium related sanctions on Russia. The US has already taken steps along this route, with the formation of a strategic uranium reserve last month and its first purchase (RFP closes August 1st) of 1m lbs, as well as extending a currently active contract with Centrus Energy (LEU) to continue production of enriched uranium domestically. If you can count to three, you can connect those dots yourself. Might be a tall order.

**C. Downside**

This particular play has a tendency to get ahead of itself and be bubbly. The nuclear cycle of mining, refining, enriching, supplying is verrrrrry slow. It takes years to go from the ground to the plant, but at least the last few years have seen this process started with an uptick of prospecting and sampling so that many of the smaller miners know what they have, and know their recovery rate. All they need is a spot price higher than cost (65/70+) and the political backing to make domestic uranium the future. 

These long timescales don‚Äôt work well with an influx of new money into such a small sector, so equities shoot higher, but eventually realize that the profits will take a long time to be realized, but ideally we‚Äôre mostly in before the big boys. That said, Morgan Stanley just yesterday ranked uranium as the #1 commodity looking from now to 2025 in their pro sub letter. 

**D. Position or Ban**

Broadly, this can be split into three types of plays. Miner/explorers, enrichment/utilities, and SPUT.

If you want a miner, then CCJ is your man despite being Canadian, as well as several others that are too small of marketcap. Seem the comments. CCJ basically is the U market, but there is also a miner's ETF that provides broader access. I think US explorers, such as UEC, are the best bet given the heavy state support expected, and the requirements that uranium be domestically mined and enriched, so see comments or google for US-based miner plays stand out as far as what meets the minimum cap size here and have enough liquidity to actually trade options. I‚Äôm sure other people will suggest in the comments for the microcap miners and explorers. While I‚Äôm only buying team USA U, obviously Canada is home to the majority of the companies.

Again, that is UEC (and other below 1.5b) for USA-based, CCJ for Canada, and the mining ETF. There is also a very broad URA ETF.

Enrichment &amp; Utility:

LEU, Centrus Energy, is the only domestic enrichment in the US and it currently only has a small pilot contract with the DoE for a minuscule amount of HALEU. That‚Äôs it. Urenco is foreign owned, and the one that does laser enrichment is too small to name here (google, it‚Äôs the only one in the world). CCJ has a stack in both of those. LEU has deep government insider contacts with their board essentially being ex Washington DC scum or ex Pentagon scum, so seems like a winning team? Right now LEU basically just buys Russian and French enriched uranium and stores it and sells it for more. They have a strong order book and currently have an EPS of 2.81. Yes, you read that right.

BWXT is also a good, but slower and lower risk, play on nuclear plants. It would be like selling shovels at a gold rush.

SPUT (google the US OTC ticker) is something special. It‚Äôs a physical trust that buys massive amounts of uranium off the spot market and just holds it. It currently holds the better part of a year of the global annual production of uranium. It‚Äôs only been around for a bit over a year, so that‚Äôs damn impressive. It currently is trading at a discount to NAV of \~11% even as spot price has dropped these last few weeks. That won‚Äôt last once the broad market sell off ends, or uranium gets a bit more government support. It‚Äôs the lowest risk, but with no options and the current discount, it is also the slowest play. Schwab has it, not sure who else does.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of shares of every ticker I‚Äôve said above, plus LEAPs on UEC and smaller US-based miners, and shorter dated calls galore. Typically, uranium has a contracting season that starts in Sept/Oct (so maybe don‚Äôt buy August calls if you want to be safer) as that is when utilities contract for the next set of deliveries and it drives up spot price and the entire sector.

Go forth and make money. Also, fed blackout period starts tomorrow. No one to throw shade for two weeks! Pesky reality (I'm still a bear on the current market outside of energy).",Uranium: Start of a Commodity Supercycle part Deux!,1.0,2022-07-15 19:36:20

Due Diligence C3 AI

Ticker AI

 Company Overview:

C3 AI makes enterprise software for companies and various organizations within the DOD. Their suite of software provides everything necessary to design develop and implement an AI enterprise software application. Once implemented C3 focuses its AI software on; problem solving, cost savings, and process improvement. They also provide 40 ‚Äúturn key‚Äù applications which are designed to address a host of problems or needs within an organization. Examples of some of the applications they provide are; smart lending, cash management, customer churn, supply network risk, energy management and revenue protection.

Why Would Customers Choose C3 AI:

C3 is attempting to establish itself as an industry leader by offering an all-encompassing approach to its software to address any needs the customer has. Customers can use its enterprise software applications to address the needs of their organization as a standalone service. However, what sets C3 apart is their ability to integrate with strategic partners and competitors, making their software extremely flexible. Applications, once licensed to its customers can be integrated with AWS, Microsoft, Google Cloud, private cloud and edge in order to run the software. C3 also provides its customers the ability to move its applications across these different clouds if the one the customer originally integrated with is no longer preferred. C3‚Äôs applications can also be directly integrated with aspects of their competitor‚Äôs software such as Snowflake, Databricks, data iku and many more to enhance customer experience and usually at no additional cost. Furthermore, C3 AI has strategic marketing partnerships with; Adobe, Baker Hughes, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Intel, Raytheon, HP, Engie and FIS in order to introduce their software to targeted industries globally.

Growth Strategy:

C3 has an overall goal of establishing and maintaining global market leadership. According to their CEO Thomas Siebel, they have already completed the first phase of their growth plan. Which was building the technology, bringing it to market and proving it‚Äôs utility. Now C3 is in phase two of its growth plan which consists of three parts. The first of which is focusing on extracting more value from existing customers through; licensing additional products, licensing additional users, and incurring run time fees. So far, they have been pretty successful. Take for example Shell. Their initial contract with shell was for $300,000. Now in year 5 their total committed agreements exceed 90 million dollars. The second is by Expanding Multi-Tiered Distribution. Which mean‚Äôs that they are focused on expanding their market‚Äôs geographically, vertically (across different industries) and finally by expanding its strategic sales and technology partners. Their strategic marketing partners are incredibly important to C3‚Äôs growth, as it is how they break out into new industries. For example, the way C3 broke out into oil and gas was by entering an exclusive partnership with Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes was already one of the largest suppliers of technology to the oil and gas industry and that is how they got Shell as a client. C3 plans on using this same strategy of entering partnerships with established leaders in a targeted industry to expand its sales reach. The third part of their growth strategy is expanding C3‚Äôs partnership ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;



Financials:

Looking at C3‚Äôs performance for FY 2022 they seem to being growing at a very healthy rate. Full year revenue grew at 38% compared to 17% last year. Net cash flow increased by 54% YOY. Customer count increased to 223 from 151. Representing a 48% YOY growth in customers. However, C3 had a full year FY 2022 GAAP net loss of $1.84 per share which was up from $0.83 last year. C3 ended Q4 FY 2022 with $960.16 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet and only $30.46 million in debt.

Risks:

An investment in C3 does present significant risks. For one the enterprise AI space is incredibly crowded. A competitor could easily steal market share from C3, if they don‚Äôt remain competitive in pricing and technology offerings. Second, C3 isn‚Äôt profitable. C3 spends huge amounts on R&amp;D, stock-based compensation and marketing. Heavy spending on marketing is concerning considering the partnerships they have. Third, its revenue concentration is concerning. It‚Äôs partnership with Baker Hughes accounts for approximately 31% of its revenue.

Conclusion:

In conclusion it is my opinion that C3 AI might have a place in your portfolio.  C3 has a considerable advantage over competitors. Most of their competitors in this space can only offer a hand full of AI solutions where C3 is almost a one stop shop when you consider their technology suite, turn key applications and their ability to integrate with third parties, including some of their competitors. A lot of downside seems to be baked into this stock already as it is already down 42.26 % YTD. While it could always go lower the current share price already seems to represent good value. Because C3 isn‚Äôt profitable yet I like to look at Price to sales and Price to Book which are as follows; P/S of 8.25 which is down from 37.76 YOY. P/B of 2.5 which is down from 6.3 YOY which also represents a significant discount. While the over spending for marketing and stock-based compensation is concerning, C3‚Äôs CEO plans on cutting the marketing budget from 29% of revenue to 11%. And CEO Thomas Siebel plans of turning a profit within the next 6 quarters. While it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to watch this stock for a better entry price, at current levels it seems to represent good value.

According to Imaginary Money Friends (IMF).  Among Asian countries affected by the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, NPLs peaked rapidly (within 1 year) and were resolved slowly (over more than 7 years) in Malaysia and Thailand but peaked slowly (after 3 to 4 years) and were resolved rapidly (within 2 years of the peak) in Japan and Korea. During the same period, in countries outside Asia, NPLs tended to peak fast and be resolved within 7 years.

Netflix has named Microsoft as its partner for its ad-supported service, the companies announced Wednesday.

‚ÄúMicrosoft has the proven ability to support all our needs as we together build a new ad supported offering. More importantly, Microsoft offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members,‚Äù Netflix COO Greg Peters said in a statement.

The ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù streamer, which has been struggling to retain and add subscribers, announced in April that it was planning on rolling out an ad-supported tier after years of resisting the move.

Co-CEO Reed Hastings has long been opposed to adding commercials or other promotions to the platform but said during the company‚Äôs prerecorded earnings conference call that it ‚Äúmakes a lot of sense‚Äù to offer customers a cheaper option.

Read more: Netflix announces ‚ÄòStranger Things‚Äô spinoff

The offering has a lot of profit potential for Netflix as it works to sign up more users. In an effort to lure more subscribers, Netflix has increased its content spend, particularly on originals. To pay for it, the company hiked prices of its service. Netflix said those price changes are helping to bolster revenue but were partially responsible for a loss of 600,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada during the most recent quarter.

Netflix has been interviewing potential partners for the past several months, including Google and Comcast, as it prepares to launch the tier before the end of 2022. 

Unlike Google, which owns YouTube, and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal‚Äôs Peacock, Microsoft doesn‚Äôt operate a competing streaming service to Netflix.

Peters said the ad-efforts are still in the ‚Äúvery early days,‚Äù with ‚Äúmuch to work through.‚Äù

Netflix is slated to release quarterly earnings Tuesday. It had previously warned it could lose 2 million subscribers during the second quarter. Netflix shares have dropped more than 70% year-to-date.

The new business is a boon for Microsoft‚Äôs advertising division, which contributes 6% of the software company‚Äôs total revenue.

The Bing search engine, where Microsoft picks up revenue by showing ads in search results, is not as popular as Alphabet‚Äôs Google, and in 2015 Microsoft exited the display-ad market as Aol took on that unit.

Shoppers paid sharply higher prices for a variety of goods in June as inflation kept its hold on a slowing U.S. economy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.

The consumer price index, a broad measure of everyday goods and services related to the cost of living, soared 9.1% from a year ago, above the 8.8% Dow Jones estimate. That marked another month of the fastest pace for inflation going back to December 1981.

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI increased 5.9%, compared with the 5.7% estimate. Core inflation peaked at 6.5% in March and has been nudging down since.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI rose 1.3% and core CPI was up 0.7%, compared to respective estimates of 1.1% and 0.5%.

Taken together, the numbers seemed to counter the narrative that inflation may be peaking, as the gains were based across a variety of categories.

y'all making fun of us europoors right now with Euro/USD ratio hitting the 1. But y'all missing the opportunity here: Exports are on discount!

I won't share some fancy graphs since I've eaten all those crayons already, but look at this link:

If you look closely, it has ""Harvard"" in the URL. So this must be top notch and super smart data. Germany is the greatest exporter of goods in Europe. Who is the biggest importer of German goods? Oh yes! USA! With the Euro dropping 20% this past year, it means, that German products are basically on discount right now. Fancy a German car? Or some other machinery-contraption for your wifes boyfriend? Or some special medmeds? How about a 20% discount? Sounds good?

German sales teams have it really easy to sell those products right now. Look at this:

[https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economy/Foreign-Trade/Tables/overall-development-foreign-trade.pdf?\_\_blob=publicationFile](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economy/Foreign-Trade/Tables/overall-development-foreign-trade.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)

It has a lot of numbers! But don't look at the numbers! Look at the plus signs in column 4. Do you see a pattern? Yes, there is a clear pattern of straight plusses. Exports only go up! Now you might say: with all that shit going down in Euroland, this might be risky. But here is the deal though: all that oil that is imported and needed for production is already priced in. And if it isn't, it doesn't matter: There is no Wendys in Germany. Germans just will keep on engineering, producing and exporting like it always had.

Germany always has been the strongest economy in Europe and even though it is just the size of Montana so that y'all who never left your basement have a frame of reference. Germany has the second biggest foreign trade surplus in the whole world, right after China (which is the size of China). Now that the Euro is down, German manufacturers drool over all those products they can sell to US companies.

Here you can see the current account balances compared to other countries:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_current\_account\_balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_current_account_balance)

Oh, Germany has the greatest surplus? And what? US has the biggest deficit? I start to see a pattern! I need some crayons to investigate this. The thing is: The Eurozone has a flaw. The monetary union is a one-size-fits all policy. Yes, fellow smoothbrainers, I chose examples that even you can understand. Just like there are t-shirts that are supposedly ""one-size-fits-all"", have you ever encountered that one of those shirts perfectly fit you? No. Cause there are no real average people. In the same way there are no perfectly average economies and especially not in Europe. Still they all adopted the same currency and are object to the same monetary policies. Germany with the highest GDP in the EU is laughing its ass off because of that. It profits of the fact, that the other Europoor countries kept the Euro comparatively low and export all those goods to non-Euro-countries and create this huge foreign trade surplus year after year. Now with the Euro down even more!

So how do we make money with this? Just go long Germany: Tickers EWG, EWGS (there is another similar ticker with an H in the beginning - DONT BUY IT though, since it is hedged). EWGS is especially interesting since Germany has a lot of ""mittelst√§ndische Unternehmen"".

Before we go any further‚Ä¶ the ‚ÄúYou cant TA the VIX‚Äù comments‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt hurt you little fingers typing that‚Ä¶ I tend to disagree and believe the VIX is very trending when it wants to be‚Ä¶

Here my friends is the Daily Chart of the VIX for all of 2022. What do you see?

Green channel- this is where we spend a lot of the beginning of the January and February and briefly spent time in April. This range is 18.7 to 25.5.

Orange channel- this is where we peak in Feb and March and spent almost all of May, June and July until last week. This ranges from 25.5 to 34.7

You also see we just broke major ‚Äúsupport‚Äù on the black dotted line last Thursday on the VIX. You also see we have been making lower highs on the VIX since January 24th we have not made a new peak. And we also haven‚Äôt made a recent higher high since May 2nd. 

Time wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX &gt;25.5.

Okay still with me here?

IF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX ‚Äúbottom‚Äù tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn‚Äôt have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. 

This means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. 

Current positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn‚Äôt properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th.

What does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the ‚Äúbig one‚Äù and see ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn‚Äôt quite seal the deal. 

If my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. 

The one question that we don‚Äôt know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. 

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel

The week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven‚Äôt already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. 

What if im wrong? Whats the worst case scenario and time to cut bait on VIX/ UVXY calls? 

&amp;#x200B;

IF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don‚Äôt see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. 

All I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC‚Ä¶ Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July. I think July is about to be capitulation month for SPY and the markets.",Its time to go long on VIX/ UVXY calls... July is going to be a bloodbath,1.0,2022-07-11 02:38:30

put down your crayons and stop gambling with your allowance for a couple minutes. Today we received the tragic news that **Shinzo Abe died after being shot.** So shut up for a couple minutes and pay some respect to this decent gentleman. As you might know he was a man of the markets, just like we are.

https://preview.redd.it/zugyk3t6jca91.png?width=1695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b86918f4feb4ff77d3256ca914312dbbcb7f208

Shinzo was delivered like we all are, as a tiny,  rather clueless package. **Look at his proud parents.**

*Processing img 72paw018jca91...*

the thing that Shinzo will probably be most remember for is his **comprehensive monetary policy that was a relative success and helped lift Japan from a viscous deflationary cycle** that had a grip on the country since the 90's.

[Look kids, its not rocket science. Build things and sell them.](https://preview.redd.it/0se4yjj9jca91.png?width=1579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cec945c17f3065ba31fbccd48159580b66288139)

While the american markets flourished after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Japan was threading water and suffered a shrinking economy in combination with worrisome economic decline. To fix this, he devised the so called **""3 Arrows"" strategy.** Google it, it's interesting. The basic idea was to stimulate the economy, get the banks printing again while being fiscally responsible.

[Back in the ring after the 80's](https://preview.redd.it/xnpunkrbjca91.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93b7ddb75bbb9b0afe5b73d4844d053cf6775050)

Apart from his economic successes, Abe was also charismatic leader who brought the Olympics, a stronger participation of Japan in the international community, founding of the ""Quad"" (Asia's mini-Nato)

[Me, winning the Olympics](https://preview.redd.it/df5gqlrcjca91.png?width=1667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da98dcb22b13cbe4ac7452cfa735745d8be003ce)

Like many leaders he was also a good buddy of ex president Trump. Watch them here feeding Kois together.

So while his legacy is not of controversy, **we should pay our last respects to Mr. Abe** as a man of the markets. Don't forget the Japanese central bank holds about 20% of the stock market over there. That's what I call a YOLO.

As a bonus, let me tell you a secret. **In Japan, gains are red and losses are green.** You are welcome.

Thanks for making dollar so strong compared to our money, my broker now shows my account just -20% when I am -40% on almost everything because the Euro has fallen 20% with respects to the dolar.

This made me thinking. Google is selling their new phone at a fixed price in Euros, and they have not increased that price. So did Apple with their iphones. An Iphone 13 is 899‚Ç¨ and 6 months ago that would mean 1029 USD, while now it is just 907 USD. So basically the money Apple are getting for each phone sale have dropped with 14% in the last 6 months. 

I think this is not priced in the earnings calculations and estimations. I know a lot of phones are sold in the US, but any market outside will have their margins wacked because of the currency.  


So, long story short, companies that have sticky prices and are selling a lot to Europe will get hurt more than expected.

649,1657188905,vtf90s,1,"Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has recently been a staple of ‚Äúinvesting meme‚Äù space since early 2022. Throughout social media, she is both famous and infamous for her lucrative investments in the stock market. TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit - throughout various channels of social media, you will find investing influencers publicizing and discussing the congresswoman‚Äôs latest stock trades as a proxy to get ahead in the stock market.

According to the STOCK (stop trading on congressional knowledge) act, all members of Congress must disclose any financial transaction of stocks within 45 days of purchase, and the trades they make are accessible to the public. Discussion of these trades has especially been active on ‚Äúr/wallstreetbets‚Äù, a subreddit forum where retail investors discuss current stock market trends; the same subreddit in which retail investors banded together to influence the market through the GameStop short squeeze back in January 2021.

Part of the reason why Nancy Pelosi has garnered so much social media attention is due to her successes ‚Äì one after another‚Ä¶after another. In July 2021, she made $5.3 million by exercising call options to buy 4000 shares of google, moments before the House Judiciary Committee voted on antitrust regulation. Other very profitable stock picks like Tesla, CrowdStrike, and Apple have drawn the eyes of retail investors, even causing a debate about whether Congress members should be allowed to dabble in the stock market or not.

The multi-millionaire congresswoman has done quite well in the stock market - but she has a competitive advantage: her husband. Paul Pelosi, who was recently arrested and charged with a DUI, runs a venture capital firm and is responsible for all the trades that Pelosi files. According to the New York Post, Pelosi has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by nearly 15% in 2020 - Paul seems to be more responsible with his wife's investments than he is behind the wheel. In light of her success, young retail investors are attempting to copy her stock moves to identify long-term winners.

I know most of the retards here still have a bad taste in their mouth from papa Karp but we in the data analytics industry call that gender neutral analytic juice, it‚Äôs non-binary and not gay to swallow it. 

Here‚Äôs the deal on Palantir, companies are starting to realize that they‚Äôre the real deal. Since the pandemic a slew of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and data analytics companies came out of the woodwork claiming to do what Palantir has been doing. Almost all of these companies are programs that just utilize third party programs/software. Palantir is a software platform built from the ground up that does everything other companies have been saying they but with native AI and capabilities like app development with their Workshop module (which birthed HyperAuto and Skywise as well as other apps).


Let me take you back to a primitive time. A time before the cloud, a time before your wife met her boyfriend. Rumblings were afoot that one day companies would store all their data in the cloud and digitally transform their company into a mythical Pok√©mon that could rub your prostate from miles away. Fast forward to today and everyone has their own cloud server, if you run a company you‚Äôre on Google cloud, Microsoft Azure, Cloud Flare, Snowflake and probably your grandmas cloud start-up. There‚Äôs different security levels and all types of restrictions for each cloud. You want data? Hire a team of engineers to pull data out from each cloud server and make sense of the data then hire another team to take that data and make it actionable to monetize it. Most of the time these teams make mistakes and all of that work means nothing at the end of a months or years long process. And it‚Äôs getting more messy, as of right now there are tools to to manage all your cloud services and even tools that manage the tools that manage your cloud services and data. It has become the digital equivalent of a clusterfuck of files stacked on top of each other and has become increasingly more expensive to manage it, let alone make that data actionable. 


Enter Palantir, an out of the box solution that builds pipelines out of all your data lakes, warehouses and services and brings it into a crisp, autistic friendly interface which can then build models, run simulations and digital twins of your business. All that *time and money* wasted is saved, those same engineers that would‚Äôve been busy on aggregating all of that data are being more productive and actually making solutions, not being digital librarians. 

As more and more companies claim they can do this companies are finding out that these ‚ÄúAI‚Äù companies are really bundling third party services in a very limited way as we are now seeing with C3.ai amongst other companies. Palantir‚Äôs native AI and in house solutions built from the ground up completely blow by the competition and in spectacular fashion. Palantir is so unique that the US government has awarded them with a [sole source contract](https://sam.gov/opp/7401f474b61143eaa400f8190143c6ec/view). No one can do what they do, even the big boys together couldn‚Äôt accomplish this. Interesting shit. 



Also, Palantir doesn‚Äôt collect data. I know some retards can‚Äôt believe the news would lie to them but in [Palantir‚Äôs S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm) on page 1 they clearly state:  ‚ÄúWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data ‚Äî data that they already have.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be a fuck tard. 

So what exactly is this black box, baby killing, family separating, Trump supporting, Satan worshipping company? They‚Äôre a software company, plain and simple and once they get SBC down (which they already cut by over 22% and Karp has said will come down much more in the near future) they will be a highly profitable one. Currently they are a FCF machine, have almost 0 debt and are improving margins q/q. They‚Äôre in the very early stages of people starting to realize what exactly they do and how needed and important it actually is.

After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot harder and more complex than initially thought.

You know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‚Äòll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting ‚ÄúHumans are underrated‚Äù. Heartwarming.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it. 

Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vapourware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.

When things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, this bombshell hit the wire:

If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it. 

Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

The deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts**

We have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, we are now going to war. 

As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful ‚Äúluxury‚Äù car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver ssist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. They combine everything MBA‚Äôs are afraid of. 

* Insanely capital intensive 
* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008) 
* Humongous unionised workforces 
* Stiff competition 
* Razor thin margins 
* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation) 
* Supply chains longer than the river nile  

You get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years. 

No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are damn impossible. 

As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need. 

Famously, Railroads are really ‚ÄúTransportation‚Äù companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers. 

That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don‚Äôt need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA‚Äôs darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP. 

What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business?

And cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can‚Äôt we? We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it.

If you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. FSD was going to work next year and don‚Äôt bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins. 

Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.

Add a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a 99.999% stock based compensation plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. **EVER**.

Enter 2020. After a short rally into february, a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of normandy, this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.

Every person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something **BIG**

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: Liftoff**

Now with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard. 

**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee. 

So how do we fix the valuation? After we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic 

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients for any  good bull story.  Hype, momentum and FOMO. Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?

You bet! Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centrepiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. Bubbles burst at these G-Forces. 

This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.

Everyone, EVERYONE was buying calls, WSB was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls. 

Even Softbank bought calls. Usually the last stop before wonky unicorns raise their last round before going public or broken, decided to chip in. **And in a big way.**

Thank you for your service! Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was. 

All brought tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of 1TN+ USD. We gave back some of these gains but the valuation can still be described as ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù lofty.

**4. The short the short shorts short** 

I am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning. 

**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: ‚ÄúNever short Tesla‚Äù, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.** 

As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project. 

And as we have learned, the market really can‚Äôt stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick. 

For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/avdawlazbx891.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eb3d58ef40909c7dd075e46685dc085633efe95

I am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Teslas remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market. 

So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market. 

This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market. 

They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let‚Äôs try to read a bit into the recent clues. 

1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are ‚ÄúGiant Money Money furnaces‚Äù we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs. 
2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.
3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated. 
4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious. 
5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars. 
6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months. 
7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending. 
8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4. 
9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let‚Äôs see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit. 
10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550. 
11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ‚Öì stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now? 

This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to 200-400 within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking? 

* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow 
* Earnings are next month 
* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading. 

Ok, I am in. How are we playing this? 

If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, you are **TEAM ‚ÄúI might be early but I am not wrong‚Äù‚Ñ¢** **Burry** , you buy puts. Depending on your personal risk tolerance 300 strike puts with 1 month DTE look about right. If you want to play it safe, LEAP puts for January ‚Äò23 should get you going. This is where I am at. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Tesla's valuation might have a short term nosedive.** 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are **TEAM STAN** you buy calls because inflation is over and the price action this year was just a dip. Buy calls or shares, don‚Äôt bother me with the details. 

If you are **TEAM Retard**, you start selling puts on TSLA because the IV is nice and high and the price levels don‚Äôt look all the bad.

It can't find it, despite looking in many places on Reddit and trying to google the name of some of the bets that I've seen there.

If you don‚Äôt know what it is, google it. After that, if you still don‚Äôt understand please don‚Äôt procreate and if you live in Colorado where I live please don‚Äôt operate a motor vehicle around me either.
The reason Burry‚Äôs comment has thrown me off.  I‚Äôve felt the fed could be wrong in how quickly CPI fades specifically Core CPI. I don‚Äôt see how the shelter index (housing and rent) which is 30% of Core is coming down quickly. While demand is coming down on housing there‚Äôs still a shortage on supply and the people who can afford but did not buy in the last couple years have flooded into rentals driving up prices there as well.  I see it in the apartment complex I‚Äôm in (a more expensive one for my area, cause I‚Äôm a big dick baller), the young college kids have moved out, presumably to their parents basement and families have moved in (people that should be in homes).  There‚Äôs a shit ton of supply coming, more than ever in history according to FRED but I don‚Äôt see how it doesn‚Äôt take a year or two to adjust the market prices significantly.
So, back to Burry‚Äôs comment. The bull whip effect, if he‚Äôs correct, could cause rather quick deflation in durables and non durables (although I don‚Äôt see how in stuff like new cars and washing machines, with all the semiconductor bullshit and steel shortages).  Supposedly, since China‚Äôs put all their slaves back to work everything we need is either on ships headed to the US or gonna be soon. Which means, Black Friday this year might be Free Friday.
God damnit, I went on way to long here.
What I‚Äôm saying is I thought the fed was wrong and therefore the markets were wrong and was considering a YOLO of LEAPS even though I would get raped on premiums but now with Burry‚Äôs comments I‚Äôm hesitant because a quick deflation means the fed goes back to stroking the markets harder than that Filipino ladyboy did on my first backpacking trip through Southeast Asia (you haven‚Äôt lived as a heterosexual male until you‚Äôve had a 95 pound man with fake cans and mascara give you a HJ in a shady hotel room in a third world country).","Bull whip your wife‚Äôs boyfriend Burry, you bastard.",1.0,2022-06-29 22:40:14

GPUs aren't the main story with AMD, CPUs are

the most successful semiconductor company over the last decade AMD reveals Zen 4. Zen is the codename for a family of computer processor microarchitectures from AMD, first launched in 2017 with the 1st gen of its Ryzen CPUs. It is used in Ryzen (desktop &amp; mobile), Ryzen Threadripper (workstation/high end desktop), &amp; Epyc (server)

RYZEN, a combination of 'horizon' &amp; their codename 'zen' &amp; EPYC, connoting a 'new epoch' or 'era' in server computing, &amp; change of 'epic' scale

AMD Ryzen microchips are used in Tesla cars replacing the Intel Atom chips

Tesla started installing an upgraded accelerated processing unit (APU) in the newly-built Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y cars ‚Äî the AMD RDNA 2-based Ryzen APU. Before this upgrade, the Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y had the basic low-level Intel Atom graphics processing unit (GPU)

Tesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, &amp; much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it‚Äôs going to regularly update its computers with more performance. that‚Äôs both for driver-assist/self-driving systems &amp; for the media center &amp; that is a scientific fact

Tesla originally used Nvidia SoC's in its older vehicles, but switched 3 years ago to Intel' Atom CPUs for the infotainment centers in Model 3 &amp; newer versions of the Model X &amp; Model S. Tesla now switched the Model S &amp; X to AMD chips, &amp; completing the transition with the Model Y. Tesla's new AMD graphics chipset has PS5 Performance

Tesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, and much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it‚Äôs going to regularly update its computers with more performance, that‚Äôs both for driver-assist/self-driving systems and for the media center

TLDR: SI% of the Float/Free Float isn't the only thing that is signaling more movement to the upside and anyone that entered Short Positions on June 1st or earlier is most likely down over 100% on the position!

*(I welcome any criticisms of my thoughts but if you don't have anything more than a trolling comment then you can keep it to yourself. Bring facts and we can discuss it.)*

I think this needs to be said but you need to look at if the different sites we look at reporting data are reporting the SI% as a percentage of the FLOAT or FREE FLOAT and how they define each.

The general consensus is that the Float = (Shares Outstanding) - (Restricted Shares).

Ortex lists the Free Float which they define as:

*""Most investors are likely familiar with shares outstanding, which is the total number of shares that a company has issued and exist currently. However,* **some of those shares are restricted from being freely traded, and therefore do not contribute to a company‚Äôs overall liquidity** *as it relates to daily trading activity.* **For example, insiders and executives** *often hold stock for long periods of time with no intention of trading. Many* **large institutions may also be long-term holders**, *particularly* **index funds** *that are required to track a benchmark and hold the underlying securities. Early investors such as* **venture capitalists may be considered strategic investors**. *When you exclude these categories of investors, you arrive at free float.""*

This is how Ortex and other places sometimes list a Free Float that is smaller than the Float listed by some sites. I personally take anything from Ortex with a huge grain of salt but that's me. I will look at the numbers sometimes but NEVER without looking at other data set's and charts too.

Which metric is better is argued about often and both have their pro's and con's.

If you wonder how a place calculates the Float/Free Float just google ""How does (insert website) calculate float"" and you will most likely find their formula. If you want to get better at trading and being able to recognize if something is potentially a Pump and Dump then knowing how to look at different data sets is key. No one indicator is ever the GOD INDICATOR but when you look to see if other indicators also signal something then it's a great place to start.

**I'm long on Greenbox with Shares and even if you look at the SI% as a percentage of the Float or Free Float it is EXTREMELY high. That alone isn't a great signal but when you combine it with things like the astronomical Cost-to-Borrow rates, Hard-to-Borrow status, FTD's, massive jump in Volume, and its recent movement to the upside they ALL point to new ATH's.**

Shorts are bleeding HARD and it looks like it's gonna get worse.

If you want a decent cost to Shorts calculation just from the CTB:

If someone Shorted 100 shares on June 1st it would have cost them about $600.

Since then they would have had to pay $190-$320 (approximately) in just CTB fees. That's about 30-60% of their take from just selling the shares Short.

Add in the amount they're down JUST today from the price being $9.85 versus the $6 when they shorted and they are looking at potentially being down at least 100% on the position right now!

If they opened before June 1st they are down significantly more. The only day they could have Shorted before June 1st that would be higher than what Greenbox closed at today was May 2nd and that was only for approximately a 30 minute period that afternoon. Even then, they'd be down overall because of the super high Cost-to-Borrow.

With Greenbox being Hard-to-Borrow for so long, I think most Short positions were opened well before June 1st.

Charting wise, I think we are in a solid Bull Flag/Descending Wedge. I think the support level of the Bull Flag was set on June 14th at $8.90 and while we broke bellow that very briefly today, I think it was a false break. On the 30 Minute chart we had 6 candles bounce right off the $8.90 level. Two have wicks that go bellow but those drops were quickly gobbled up.

Reclaiming the EMA 200 (pink line) on the 5 and 30 min charts will be important.

He occasionally watches TV and he really likes storage wars and pawn stars because he used to fix vintage guitars and jukeboxes and he like knows all about the junk on those shows.

Anyway, there's a show I've seen clips of that I thought he would love about Ozzy Osbourne and his son Jack and they drive around and look at cool stuff, and I'm like this is perfect for my dad. 

So I Google the show and it turns out you can get it one of two ways. 1 you can buy each season individually on Amazon for a total of like $60. Or you can have an A&amp;E package with cable. 

At this point I wasn't going to buy a cable subscription for him, but I checked out the prices anyway.

Bro, you people who pay for cable are insane. Some of these monthly subscriptions were close to $100. Fuck that.
$15 a month for NETFLIX is a steal. I had no idea the price was so competitive. And you can cancel any time and go watch a show on another provider. Last month I cancelled my Netflix, bought Crunchyroll and watched all the demon slayer episodes, then cancelled and just got Netflix again.

Today we‚Äôve crossed the 3,000 case mark, I‚Äôve been following since ~1,200‚Äôs, and can personally say, this is not slowing down anytime soon.

When the WHO finally blows the whistle on Monkeypox come thursday, all Monkeypox related pharmaceutical companies will easily go up 20, 30, 40% or even more. 

Because of this, IV on some of these options range anywhere from 130-195% and even more. Because of the eminent IV crush, I personally think it‚Äôs too risky to buy calls, though you can still load up on very inexpensive shares and earn a quick double/tripple bagger.

If you can recall back when COVID-19 first started, we saw vaccine and antiviral companies have 2,000% run-ups, and for good reason, these companies with high profit margins are securing multi-million dollar contracts with numerous different governments and other major healthcare providers.

I can‚Äôt say certain tickers because they are JUST under the $1 billion market cap, and I rather not get banned. Therapeutic companies over vaccine companies because we saw how much of a nightmare it was to mandate vaccines in the US, and once a case is confirmed, patients need therapeutic drugs, not vaccines.

December 14, 2021, 9:56 AM EST

Mark Zuckerberg sold Meta Platforms Inc. stock almost every weekday of this year. The founders of Google began to unload shares in May, which is also when two of the three Airbnb Inc. co-founders started diversifying their stakes. 

The transactions are part of a surge of selling by the very richest Americans. They unloaded $42.9 billion in stock through the start of December, more than double the $20.2 billion they sold in all of 2020, according to an analysis of transactions by U.S. billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the world‚Äôs richest 500 people.

The super-wealthy often hold onto shares in the companies that made their fortunes, because realizing gains triggers a tax bill. But many rich Americans are deciding to unload shares now, while stock valuations are at records and before their taxes potentially rise at the start of 2022.

Please share your thoughts, as Game Stop Corp approaches the phase where it will launch its own digital asset marketplace, as well as issuance of its stock dividend/split, which will affect all agencies and institutions which have an interest (or otherwise an adverse interest), whether it be reported or unreported interest, in Game Stop Corp.",‚ù§ Game Stop Corp stock ‚ù§ soars while markets collapse.

There will be plenty of avenues to pursue from an investment standpoint, from green energy plays to mining the materials needed to produce the necessary green tech, and everything in between. 

Well one of these potential avenues I've been hearing A LOT about lately are heat pumps. For starters, just google that term and check out the top news articles.

"" [Biden Order Will Boost Heat Pumps and Building Insulation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biden-order-will-boost-heat-pumps-and-building-insulation/) ""

Here are some especially intriguing quotes from that last article:

&gt; ‚ÄúThe importance of this cannot be understated,‚Äù said Ari Matusiak, CEO  of Rewiring America, a nonprofit that advocates for electrifying the  U.S. economy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big move by the administration.‚Äù 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Biden‚Äôs order could change that by reshaping the economics of decarbonizing buildings.  
&gt;  
&gt;By invoking the Defense Production Act, Biden is guaranteeing to  manufacturers that the government will purchase heat pumps and  insulation that the market might not support on its own.  
&gt;  
&gt;The idea is to induce firms to beef up their manufacturing capacity,  and that extra supply will help bring down prices, said Todd Tucker,  director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute.

 

&gt;He said the government is sending a message to manufacturers: ‚ÄúGo  ahead and make those capital expenditures, because we will be the market  for that product. Don‚Äôt worry that there‚Äôs not going to be a market, or  that households or firms are going to shift to some other technology ‚Äî  don‚Äôt worry about any of that; we‚Äôll worry about that. Just make it.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Biden has already sought to use the federal government‚Äôs purchasing  power to steer U.S. manufacturers toward green tech. But this is a step  beyond that, Tucker said, because the government can use this authority  to buy heat pumps for private uses too.  
&gt;  
&gt;The administration could distribute the heat pumps it purchases under  the Defense Production Act to front-line communities ‚Äî either for free  or at a discount ‚Äî in order to advance its environmental justice goals,  he said.

&amp;#x200B;

The Biden administration isn't just giving this specific technology the green light, they're filling up the tank and practically smashing the gas pedal for it. And if you've made it this far, I have what I believe is the perfect stock in the perfect position, set to fully and utterly take advantage of this situation. 

Full disclosure, I've held this stock for a number of years and it's my largest holding to date. To say I'm bullish is an understatement and a half, but I think you'll see why I like this stock as a perfect heat pump play. 

Dalrada Corp. aka $DFCO is a holding company that has over the past few years added a number of businesses via acquisitions, one of them being Likido Energy, a green energy play. Well one of their most promising technologies is their heat pump tech. I don't pretend to understand the tech, but supposedly it's a big deal in the sense that their tech makes it much more efficient than the industry standard is to date.

[https://dalrada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Dalrada-LikidoONE-summary.pdf](https://dalrada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Dalrada-LikidoONE-summary.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

But here's where it gets real good. In May the Dept of Energy, in collaboration with the US GSA (General Services Administration) Green Proving Ground program, announced they had added 6 technologies for evaluation in the GSA's inventory. One of those 6 six companies/technologies was in fact:

&gt; **C02-Based Heat Pump, Dalrada (Escondido, CA) ‚Äì**  Decarbonizing heating is key to achieving Net-Zero. This combustion-free  heat pump promises to increase heating and cooling efficiency by  capturing and reusing thermal energy while reducing global warming  potential. Using carbon dioxide as the refrigerant, this heat pump can  deliver cooling down to -22¬∞F and heating up to 250¬∞F. 

[https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/green-proving-ground-program-selects-innovative-technologies-that-enable-transition-to-netzero-carbon-05162022](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/green-proving-ground-program-selects-innovative-technologies-that-enable-transition-to-netzero-carbon-05162022)

&amp;#x200B;

So not only does $DFCO have the heat pump connection, but they literally have an in now with the Dept of Energy and god only knows what this could lead to. For the record they're only in the evaluation stage so there's no contracts set in stone as far as I know, but the simple fact that they made the cut with this program blows my mind. For an OTC company to get PRed on a .Gov site is a first for me! I firmly believe the only reason this stock isn't multiple dollars right now is because of timing. If this news came out a year ago, this could be a $5 like that. That being said, I also firmly believe the market is fast asleep on this one, with the catalyst literally right there in front of everyone to see. All it needs is the buying pressure to get eyes on it. imo

To really drive home the insane potential, here's a quote from another article referencing this program:

&gt; Heat pumps are another emerging technology being embraced by the GPG  program. Because they capture and reuse thermal energy, heat pumps are  far more efficient at heating and cooling buildings than traditional  systems, and are increasingly being used in residential buildings. The  heat pump selected for the program, developed by California-based [Dalrada Corp.](https://dalrada.com/),  uses CO2 as its refrigerant‚Äîa technology that was previously available  only at an industrial scale. It can generate temperatures between minus  22 degrees and 250 degrees Fahrenheit, using much less energy than  conventional systems.  
&gt;  
&gt; **‚ÄúIf it does deliver on all of its promises, this is a game changer,‚Äù Powell says.**

&amp;#x200B;

$DFCO was trading at .92 without any sniff of this news, and now that it's out there for everyone to see it's stuck under the radar barely holding .40. There's no dilution actively, the dip has been from normal market fluctuations in a very rough market. They've talked about uplisting to the Nasdaq and I have zero reasons to doubt them at this point. 

If you read through all of that and just want to call me a pumper, I have no clue what to say to that. Sure I'm biased, I own a lot of shares and think they'll trade for many dollars per share on the Nasdaq before too long, but I also think the news is objectively absolutely amazing and one day the market will flip a switch and this stock will trade like a completely different beast than it is right now. The liquidity is low right now but this is the sort of stock and news that when it wakes up, it trades as a $X.XX stock with actual volume and liquidity. 

I've held this stock for a number of years and have gotten friends and family on board, in fact we collectively own a decent chunk. We've joked about what would happen if reddit took this stock and ran with it, but I tried posting in the penny stock forum and it never got any replies. I thought this news would finally get your attention but again nothing. I really think it's just the timing, the market sucks right now, but I'm telling you this is a stock just begging and waiting to be mooned.","Heat Pumps are the next big thing, imo",1.0,2022-06-14 00:30:44

A quick google search will tell me that there are 123,000,000 households and 140,000,000 houses or units as of 2020. And 7 million people have seconds homes. So that leaves a 10,000,000 surplus of houses.

So it sounds to me like we have a surplus of homes in America that are just sitting there vacant, even though that same article says ""the aggregate housing shortage is now over 2 million units"".

Does this make sense to anyone?

Fair disclosure: I have a history on Wall Street and a rather detailed, memory of the stock market and futures market back in the late 70's to the 90's I am not a boomer. I love what I've done in my past and have failed ( I like to say failed forward ) more times than I care to remember, also I've been written up in the WSJ and the NYT.

Fear of recession? Yep, we are due for one, but your generations are going to be the lucky one's, I have no clue how brutal it will be, yet it will be brutal in sector rotations aspect. Why? simple observation, all the smart people have quit dumb managed companies, those companies will fail, fold, kaput or be bought out. Your generations have learn to choose positive greed mindset, meaning, find a good managed company, get stock options, work your ass off joyfully, not as a dark emotional grind and keep moving towards success... I've just learned that mindset 3 years ago and it's slowly paying off ( I tell my clients to fuck off if they don't want to pay for my knowledge ).

/ignore if you want

Recessions can be painful, I was 5 and I recall that we all ate rice, beans, potatoes, butter and whatever ""fell off a truck"" from 72 - 74, those were rough times, ( dad had a good job, but it was barely able to make end, I made a window sill garden, a back yard garden, and abandoned lot gardens and hidden in the park gardens, everywhere, we ate. To this day, I have no fear of government cheese on slice of bread heated on the intake manifold of car, got gooey, popped the hood when I got to school and dad went to work, I ate going in recycled the aluminum foil. You guys won't have to deal with that, because the government has better options now. But as a reminder, peanut butter is one of the highest denseness. I have enough peanut butter to supply my entire complex for 1 months 6 sandwich's a day ( which I am proud to say during hurricane, everyone knows I have food to share )

If you are thinking what to go long with. You should be looking for stock, and researching for stock that back in the 80-90's we called sin stock. Guns, Tobacco, Booze. those are solid slow and steady returns with dividends ( which you set to re-investment ). You might want to look at infrastructure reconditioning companies, in the late 80's ( faint memory )  I found a company that fixed used airplane parts, they had steady earning and grew like ivy on a brick wall. I don't know if they still have company's that trade and are refurbishes 

If you are thinking what to go short with : I have a faint memory of Ford ( First on race day or ""fixed or repaired daily"" and don't forget that concept it will help )  trading around the 2-4 range ( not dividend or split adjusted late 70- early 80). You want to find the ""**fixed or repaired daily**"" because those will be the car's nobody buys. The concept **might work against** computer suppliers too, I think there are 3 major hard drive suppliers, google published a report a few years back of who it the most reliable in there server farms. try to find what is something that people can put off buying for a year or 2. I have in the past used the same computer for 5 years or longer. 

Oh that reminds me, auto tires, people will foolishly let then go to the bald. so that might be something to research. 

What I do enjoy about recession is that we recover, usually with better businesses and better things to enjoy in life. 1980-82 we got apply II and c-64 and IBM PC's. 1987-89 we got better cars, upgrades to transit, lot's of better appliances, jobs that made sense ( still abusive but that's being fixed by your generation) and better airplane fares. 1992-93 consolidation, and weapons and higher taxes on tobacco ( benefit to man )  2007-2009 bank clean up and web education became forefront, who knows what 2022 will bring, I look forward to your creativity.",Sometimes you just need some re-assurance,1.0,2022-06-13 15:34:16

But that blissful veil over the sight of the people is now being lifted, swiftly and harshly, by Elon‚Äôs very public ‚Äúconversion‚Äù from fake Democrat to real Republican. Elon‚Äôs mouth-breathing cultists will tell you that this was a genius ploy to sell more Cybertrucks, conveniently forgetting that Conservatives are far less likely to want an electric vehicle of any kind, the daily humiliation of being seen by friends, neighbors, and colleagues in something as hideous as the Cybertruck, the existence of the Ford F-150 Lightning, and the fact that the Cybertruck is not in production.    

On the other hand, consumers today who do desire electric vehicles, i.e. the more liberal sections of the population, have now such varieties of choice from nearly every car manufacturer under the sun that the compellence to select a Tesla because it was essentially the only game in town has almost completely faded. Now, given the chance to direct their dollars away from someone they have come to despise, a Trump-like figure who reminded them of gun support in the era of endless mass shootings and anti abortion rights when Roe v.

With Prime, customers pay a fee of \~‚Ç¨55.00 per year. The benefits to the Prime member are discounts on each booking ‚Äì the Prime Fee is ‚Äúamortized‚Äù within the first or second booking; an exclusive 24x7 customer service hotline; and access to special deals and promotions (Prime Day sales). The benefits to eDreams are higher customer return rate (1.4x non-Prime over a 12-month period); a highly engaged customer base, as Prime customers repeat bookings 2.7x the amount of non-Prime customers; and little-to-no customer acquisition costs after the first booking, as Prime customers usually book through eDreams‚Äô App or through an eDreams exclusive channel. 

eDreams is focused on leisure travel, which recovered quickly from COVID. The below chart shows eDreams bookings growth vs. pre-COVID levels. Bookings vs. pre-COVID levels turned positive in June of 2021. There was a brief pullback due to Omicron. However, not even the Ukraine invasion could damper leisure travel demand with April and the first half of May bookings both up over 50% vs pre-COVID levels.

The strong leisure travel, combined with the savings that Prime allows, propelled Prime membership to nearly 3M members as of May 17, 2022 ‚Äì up 3x over the last year.

**Prime Membership Economics ‚Äì Building the Moat**

eDreams‚Äô CEO, Dana Dunne, focused the business, and the culture of eDreams on building the Prime Program. There is good reason for this. eDreams calculates that the lifetime value (‚ÄúLTV‚Äù) of a Prime Customer is worth 2.5x that of a Non-Prime Customer. Note that this calculation assumes a 24-month customer relationship, although the actual lifetime of a Prime customer‚Äôs relationship should be more than 24 months. Intuitively, it makes sense that the Prime Program is a good idea, but how does that translate to building a moat or making money?

The unit economics of the Prime Program are closely guarded by the company for competitive reasons. That said, we can make some assumptions that 1) should get us close to replicating the unit economics; 2) show the profitability of the Prime Program; 3) and show how the Prime Program is building a moat around eDreams‚Äô business.

We can classify eDreams revenue types into three categories. First, there is a booking fee. This is the transaction revenue that eDreams gets paid for making a booking. Second, there is the first-year Prime Fee. Third, there are post-first-year Prime Fees. Let‚Äôs look at how this translates to money for the company and a moat around its business.

When eDreams acquires a new Prime customer, that customer books a transaction (let‚Äôs use a flight in this examples) and signs up for Prime. eDreams receives a booking fee and the first-year Prime Fee. Let‚Äôs assume the first-year Prime fees goes to google or a metasearch provider as a customer acquisition cost. That leaves the booking fee. eDreams can give a portion or all of the booking fee back to the customer in the form of a Prime discount. The customer should love this, as they are receiving a discounted price for their ticket. This discounted price should keep the customer coming back for future bookings. In this example, eDreams would not make any money off a first-year Prime customer as the booking fee is given to the customer and the Prime Fee pays for the customer acquisition cost.

The second year and beyond is when it gets interesting for eDreams. The customer returns, usually via a direct method, which removes any customer acquisition cost. The customer books a ticket, at a discounted rate, which makes them happy. eDreams collects the Prime Fee, for which there is usually not any customer acquisition cost tied to it. The retention rate of Prime customers is high, as customers continue to anniversary, their Prime Fees drop right to the bottom line. This business model is akin to Costco‚Äôs where margin is not made on individual transactions, but on the membership fee; although, in eDreams‚Äô case, they get the benefit of that fee starting in the second year of membership.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t6tkgohbzh491.jpg?width=637&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d3c2f0297e665af14ec575615cfd7e5c96c34bc

The Prime virtuous cycle keeps customers in the program, which provides a moat to eDreams. Interestingly, the Prime program not only directly benefits eDreams, but the program also harms eDreams‚Äô competitors. By not having to collect transaction fees, recall eDreams gives these back to the customers in the form of discounts, they can bid aggressively on metasearch sites to acquire new customers. If eDreams wins the bid, then 60% of the time, they gain a new Prime customer and are set to realize the lifetime value of that customer. If they lose the bid to the competition, the competition is taking business at little to no margin, as the competition does not have a comparable subscription program and the associated subscription fees.

**Financial Projections**

Assumptions:

¬∑ eDreams grows subscriptions to 7.25mm buy FY25.

¬∑ eDreams gives Prime Transaction Revenue away to Prime customers. Note, for simplicity‚Äôs sake, I am excluding Prime Transaction Revenue from the below table, given it is 100% netted out of earnings.

¬∑ eDreams pays the first year Prime Fee to acquire a new customer but keeps all Prime Fees thereafter.

¬∑ Prime transactions represent 50% of total transactions in FY23 and grows to 70% by FY26.

¬∑ No change in the travel basket size (note the basket size and consequently transaction fee margins are depressed due to the shorter duration, and distance of trips post COVID). 

¬∑ No additional services are added to Prime (Prime should become a one-stop travel shop in the next few years).

¬∑ Cost of Equity equals 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3cb7czqczh491.jpg?width=582&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32f2e5d6dccb0dce3c25de80fc42cea252786d93

eDreams is currently trading at 11.7x and 7.6x my estimated FY23 and FY24 EBITDA, respectively. Booking Holdings is trading 17.6x and 13.9x, respectively. Given eDreams‚Äô stickier revenue base with its Prime program and its rapid revenue growth, what should it trade at? I‚Äôd argue at a premium to Booking Holdings. That said, if management hits their goal of 7.25mm+ in FY25, then eDreams is likely cheap. The below is a data table showing eDreams‚Äô price at various Prime subscription levels in FY25 and various terminal value multiples.

&amp;#x200B;

The current price is ‚Ç¨7.07. How does it get from its current price to its intrinsic value? First, I believe that the European investors are slow to recognize the value of eDreams as they are focused on trailing financials and not the value of existing Prime subscribers who will have anniversaries this fiscal year. As the year progresses, the value of these Prime members will be apparent, especially in the back half of the fiscal year, where a large amount of them will anniversary. That said, the word is getting out. The company has conducted one road show to the US this month, and they will conduct another one before the month is over. Additionally, the company is attending two sell-side conferences in Europe this month. The investment bank hosting one of the conferences does not presently cover eDreams. Perhaps eDreams will pick up another analyst. As the word gets out, I expect eDreams to eclipse recent highs of ‚Ç¨10.14 per share. Once they get into the double digit range, they get very close to being large enough to be included in the Ibex 35, Spain‚Äôs leading equity index. Spain has a limited amount of large publicly traded companies, and Spain has investors who want access to their home market. This could lead to a premium multiple for companies in the index.

**Concerns of the Bears**

¬∑ Revenue margin per booking is low post-COVID.

o Three reasons for this. First, the basket size is small as travelers are traveling closer to home and taking shorter trips, as they are afraid of getting stuck far from home if they contract COVID. This should normalize as restrictions continue to ease.

o Revenue per booking has in the numerator both transaction revenue and the annual Prime fee. In the denominator is the number of bookings. If a Prime subscriber books more than one booking per year, the annual Prime fee gets diluted in this metric, which makes it look lower relative to past years. Note, that eDreams earnings will not change based on the number of bookings a Prime customer makes, so this impact on this metric is not concerning.

o Revenue per booking includes first-year Prime customers. eDreams may be bidding aggressively to capture that customer, which pushes down the revenue per booking metric. However, the LTV of a Prime customer is 2.5x that of a non-Prime customer, so you should want them to bid aggressively to gain a new Prime subscriber.

¬∑ Macro environment in concerning given European inflation.

o European consumers have ample savings - ‚Ç¨907B of pandemic-related savings.

o Europeans want to travel and will prioritize it over other discretionary expenses.

o Airline capacity increases will likely absorb some of the increase in fuel prices.

o eDreams‚Äô Prime program saves customers money (that is why it is popular and has a strong repeat rate).

o The market share is in the low-single digits, so there may be a pull back in the broader leisure travel market and eDreams could still grow by taking market share. 

¬∑ Competitors can replicate their own subscription program.

o Easier said than done. Tripadvisor tried to launch a subscription program, and ultimately transitioned it to an industry-typical rebate program.

o To create Prime, eDreams‚Äô CEO changed the culture of his company to focus on LTV. Competitors have a metasearch, transaction-focused model. Switching their business model would be difficult and take a long time.

o Booking Holdings has been in flights and dynamic packages for years, and therefore had the opportunity to launch a subscription program. Thus far, they have not.",eDreams is Transforming into The Leading Subscription Business in Travel,1.0,2022-06-09 01:23:11

# The future

Meteorologists can now forecast the weather 5-days out with an accuracy of 90%. Trying to forecast the weather 10 days out, and your accuracy rate falls to 43%

https://preview.redd.it/l9yq4w5w86491.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbe90ca90cf91574c874db80ec2cf2428af53361

  
I believe the future of the market, the economy, and business is as difficult to predict as the weather and this is why it's so hard for me to pay dear multiples for growth stocks. Because their share prices are based so heavily on things that happen more than 10 years down the road- you need to really ‚Äúknow"". I believe a good price to pay for a growth stock, in a company with an obvious competitive advantage or monopoly, must be worthy to generate a 7% yield on paper. This way, if the growth flops your downside is still semi-limited.¬†

  
I have been taking a look at Belgium Post. It looks similar to a growth-flop story (analysts paying too high multiples for ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù they can‚Äôt accurately forecast). The weather changed, the growth stopped, and the growth investors left. They have left BPOST (Belgium Post) trading at a P/E of 4.64. EPS of 1.25 in 2021, at a share price of 5.8EUR. Annual report¬†[here](https://bpostgroup.com/sites/default/files/2022-04/bpost%20annual%20report%202021_EN_FIN.pdf)

Opportunity is often found where nobody else is looking. Do yourself a favor and Google Search ""Belgium Post"". Absolutely no coverage on it. BIG F\*$CING TICK BOX right there chaps. 

  
This is the story:

* 2016 to 2017 Revenue grew at 23% through acquisition. Share price very happy- I believe investors forecasting continued growth.
* 2017 to 2018 more growth- 27% Organic!! Growth investors are ecstatic‚Ä¶(But payroll costs rose a lot, and operating margin dropped).
* 2018-2019 no growth. On **13 March 2018,** they release an annual report. From that day share price goes from 27EUR to 7.63EUR. 72% Decrease in less than a year!! (Sucks to pay dear for growth). Payroll up. Operating margin down.¬†
* 2019 -2020. Revenue grows at 9.9% company changes dividend policy to a more conservative policy (30-50% IFRS profit - see image attached).¬†
* 2021-2022 Revenue growth stabilizes at 4.4%. Payroll is still high (probably the biggest risk).

30% dividend on 1.25EUR EPS (2021) is 6.5%. This is in the lower range.  
I would still like to dig through every filing to get a better feel for it, but I have a good feeling from this brief overview.

  
Risks: 1) Their parcel business is big. What happens when consumers feel the pinch and stop spending? (My risk for everything at the moment). 2) Payroll costs? Can they keep up with Belgium‚Äôs payroll increases? I remember we spoke about the need to raise prices every so-and-so year‚Ä¶ 3) What is the consensus from the consumer on the ground in Belgium regarding Bpost‚Äôs service? Is there a better competitor?

Still, the stock has been de-risked. The ""growth investors"" have given up, leaving this for dead. Leaving me to pick it up at bargain prices.

For those degens on here, I plead. stop throwing your money down the drain. Bet on surer things. If you want to REALLY BET. Then just option up and go big. But this is not advice.

**2. What is FINRA?**

FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity. We regulate one critical part of the securities industry‚Äîbrokerage firms doing business with the public in the United States. FINRA, overseen by the SEC, writes rules, examines brokerage firms, and enforces compliance with FINRA rules and federal securities laws. If brokers break the rules, we have the power to fine them, suspend them or bar them from the industry. In addition, FINRA monitors trading market activity in the U.S. equities, options and fixed income markets.

FINRA believes investor education is a critical component of investor protection. To help retail investors make informed decisions about potential investments and investment professionals, FINRA delivers at no cost to investors or taxpayers a wide array of interactive tools, including the Market Data Center, the Fund Analyzer and BrokerCheck.

FINRA also administers a dispute resolution forum for investors and brokerage firms and their registered employees. We have extensive experience in providing a fair, efficient and effective venue to handle securities-related disputes. The resolution of problems and disputes is accomplished through two non-judicial proceedings: arbitration and mediation.

Learn more about¬†[what we do](https://www.finra.org/about/what-we-do).

**3. What does a FINRA arbitrator do?**

An arbitrator who is selected to hear a case may serve as the sole arbitrator or as a member of a three-person arbitration panel. An arbitrator who accepts a case assignment must review all case materials prior to the first hearing session. Arbitrators serve as the decision makers for the dispute, and hear all sides of the case, study the evidence and render a final and binding decision.

**4. What are the benefits of becoming an arbitrator?**

FINRA arbitrators have the opportunity to acquire a broad knowledge of the securities industry and gain professional experience with a respected forum. Arbitrators get the chance to develop skills, give back, build their networks and earn honoraria.

FINRA arbitrators receive an honorarium for each pre-hearing or regular session they attend: $300 per single-session hearing (up to four-hours); $600 per double session; $350 per case decided on the papers, without an in-person hearing; and an additional $125 per hearing day for arbitrators serving as the chairperson of the panel. For cases filed on or after April 19, 2021, chairpersons will receive an additional $250 for each hearing day and an additional $125 for each prehearing conference.¬†Please see the¬†[Honorarium](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/honorarium)¬†page for additional information.

**5. Do I need to have arbitration or securities-related experience?**

No, although some arbitrators do. Arbitrators are classified as public or non-public. Individuals who are not affiliated with the securities industry are deemed public arbitrators. Individuals who work or have worked in the financial industry, or who provide(d) services to financial industry clients or to parties engaged in securities arbitration and litigation are considered non-public arbitrators. Whether a person is classified as public or non-public, all individuals who are selected to become arbitrators will receive training before overseeing their first arbitration case.

**6. What are the requirements?**

Applicants should have at least five years of paid business and/or professional experience‚Äîinside or outside of the securities industry‚Äîand at least sixty college-level credits. Generally, internships or short-term work while enrolled as a full-time student will not count towards the employment criteria.

In some instances, an individual may be temporarily or permanently disqualified from serving as a FINRA arbitrator. Please carefully review the [Disqualification Criteria](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/disqualification-criteria) before applying.

**7. What are examples of the types of cases I will hear?**

1. An investor files a claim alleging her broker and his firm made recommendations to purchase stocks that were unsuitable because they were inconsistent with her investment objectives. The investor would like to get the money back that she invested. The broker and his firm respond that the investments were suitable with the investor's investment objectives.
2. A brokerage firm hires a broker and advances her $1,000,000 as part of a promissory note. During the course of her employment, the broker repays $600,000 and then leaves the firm. The firm sues for the remaining $400,000. The broker responds that she was forced to leave, and therefore she does not owe the firm the money and files a counterclaim for unspecified damages.
3. An employee is fired from his position at a FINRA member firm. He alleges he was fired after the firm discovered his sexual orientation, when he applied for his husband to be added to the firm-sponsored medical plan. The firm responds that he was ""let go"" as part of a corporate restructuring plan.

**8. How is an arbitrator assigned to a case?**

Once an arbitrator completes FINRA's¬†[Basic Arbitrator Training Program](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-and-mediation/required-basic-arbitrator-training), he or she will be eligible to hear cases. The arbitrator's name will begin to appear on lists (generated on a random basis by our list selection system) and be sent to the parties during the list selection process. An arbitrator who is selected to hear a case may serve as the sole arbitrator or as part of a three-person arbitration panel. An arbitrator who accepts a case assignment must review all case materials prior to the first hearing session. Additionally, the arbitrator may be required to:

* participate in an initial prehearing conference call to schedule hearing dates, set discovery and motion deadlines and address any other preliminary issues involved with the case;
* participate in subsequent prehearing calls , if necessary, to resolve discovery disputes, hear arguments on motions, resolve scheduling issues and address any other matter that will simplify or expedite the hearing;
* attend an in-person hearing, when held\* (not all cases require an in-person hearing, and in such circumstances, the selected arbitrator will render a decision based on the information provided by the parties);
* discuss and deliberate the outcome after the hearing; and
* render a decision in the case.

\* FINRA assigns each approved arbitrator to one primary hearing location, which is the closest¬†hearing location to an arbitrator's primary residence. The closest hearing location may be outside of the state of residence.

Want to see a typical day at a hearing?¬†[View this video](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/finra-basic-arbitrator-training-hearing-video).

**9. How many cases will I be assigned to each year?**

Arbitrators are selected to hear cases by the parties as described above. Accordingly, FINRA cannot guarantee the number of cases to which each arbitrator will be assigned. Arbitrators may receive one to two cases each year, but service may be less frequent.

**10. Will I receive training?**

Yes. Before becoming eligible to serve on arbitration cases, all applicants who are accepted to the arbitrator roster must complete FINRA's¬†[Basic Arbitrator Training Program](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-and-mediation/required-basic-arbitrator-training). The training is free and covers each stage of FINRA's arbitration process and reviews the procedures that arbitrators must follow to successfully complete an arbitration case.¬†The training includes two separate assessments that applicants must pass. Individuals who are interested in applying to the arbitrator roster should wait until they are approved to the roster before taking the Basic Arbitrator Training Program and assessments.

After completing the mandatory online training, new arbitrators may attend¬†a¬†[voluntary orientation](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-and-mediation/voluntary-orientation). Orientations are via webinar and give new arbitrators a chance to meet FINRA staff and ask questions about serving on the roster.

FINRA also offers¬†[advanced arbitrator training](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/advanced-arbitrator-training)¬†on specific areas of FINRA's arbitration rules and processes. These sessions are available to an arbitrator who has passed the¬†[Basic Arbitrator Training Program](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-and-mediation/required-basic-arbitrator-training).

**11. Are there any costs?**

There are no application costs and no training costs. Furthermore, FINRA reimburses arbitrators for [reasonable travel expenses](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/FINRA_Arbitrator_Travel_Policy.pdf).

**12. Are FINRA arbitrators employed by FINRA?**

No. They are not employed by FINRA; they are independent contractors. FINRA arbitrators are not eligible to receive FINRA employee or unemployment benefits.

**13. I have a full-time/part-time job. Can I do that while serving as an arbitrator?**

Yes. The backgrounds of our arbitrators range from full-time workers to freelancers to retirees to stay-at-home parents.

As a FINRA arbitrator, you will have the flexibility to work around your own schedule. Arbitrators are consulted to establish the dates and times that their assigned cases will take place. Some parts of the case are conducted via telephone, and can be held in accordance with the arbitrators' schedules. Please keep in mind that cases are generally scheduled Monday ‚Äì Friday during business hours, from 9:00 a.m. ‚Äì 6:00 p.m.

742,1654126522,v2ux5o,1,"Google Sheet summarizing GME's financials from Q1 2021 to Q1 2022. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFxWYsHgW8h3Cojm-Yh6ORjn1WnDCNIFd2IXJLeAxfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFxWYsHgW8h3Cojm-Yh6ORjn1WnDCNIFd2IXJLeAxfw/edit?usp=sharing).

I'm uploading this document as a service to everyone on r/wsb. In case you don't understand what any of these numbers mean, I'll give you a rundown.

Concerning issues:

1. Inventory has piled up for Q1 2022. This has been an issue for many retailers, for example Target and Walmart, as they had to order items much more in advance due to logistical difficulties. You can see that GME had \~$570 mm in inventory handy for Q1 2021, but they now have \~$920 mm in inventory. Concerning.
2. After raising cash from investors in Q1 2021, GME ended up with no debt and with a good amount of cash in Q2 2021 (you can see that their cash jumped from \~690 mm USD to 1.7 bb USD. Within a span of 9 months, they have burned in total $685 mm in cash. At this rate, they will be out of money within 13-14 months. 
3. Alternatively, you can see that they have managed to burn a total of $496 mm in Free Cash Flow for FY 2021. They have also burned $314 mm just his quarter. Given that we have to adjust for working capital, at the current rate they are burning cash at an annualized rate of $516 mm/year. At this rate, they will run out of money in around 2 years.

Positives:

1. Shares registered w/ Computer share is rising, albeit at a slower pace. Although this statistic does NOT show that there are fake shares, we can admit that retail interest/investment in the stock is high. Additionally, assuming that these tied shares are ""locked up"" (as in these are shares that some retail investors refuse to sell), any price movement will therefore be much more volatile (the market price of any stock depends on the marginal buyer/seller). And we have seen that this is indeed the case for GME. 
2. Membership increase in the two subs that I shall not name, has been increasing at a decent pace.

Conclusion:

 1. At this pace, it's likely that GME will see further losses (I actually don't see how they can ever turn a profit, with negative 11% operating margins and increasing inventory), and they will need to either raise debt or equity within 1-2.5 years. So there are headwinds going against retail interest. Unlikely that GME will go into bankruptcy however -- they'll simply raise more equity, assuming that their stock price hasn't been obliterated. 

2. In the short-term, anything can happen. The financials and this sub does show that there are a dedicated group of GME shareholders, who don't give a rat's ass about whether GME is losing money or not. They believe, cause they believe. Given the increasing portion or registered shares, a short-term bet on a volatile GME price (and when I say short-term, I mean 1-15 days) could work out. So when GME goes up, bet that it goes down, and vice versa.

I really do hope this week brought immense happiness upon your face regardless of whether you are a trader or an investor. First of all, give yourself a nice pat on your shoulder and be proud that we stuck for this finale together and dig deep. I mean, we had to dig really, really deep for this when everywhere around were chatting about the end-of-the world talks. But we kept our heads cool DCA'ed in our favorite index called Nasdaq, for the month of may. Didn't buy a bunch of stocks, but you know, i will never ever advise you that. But unfortunately, I broke that promise last week by buying a portfolio. So ahhhh. Kinda did, but also kinda didn't. That portfolio though, is crushing it on Wall Street.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we begin our favorite months June - July - August which you already know are going to be good, ( we proved it in our previous posts ) i want to say that it was fun talking about things in the bear market. So I came to the conclusion that if I am wrong and we just go up forever after August and never look back, I will stop these weekly posts. All you will be hearing from me is after FOMC week. Now I know only a tiny fraction of you will be sad,( most of them hate my crayons and rgb drawings with TL; dr. posts XD ) but guys, you have to understand i am just a terrible guy to follow in the bull market. There are literally thousand of financial gurus of green market out there. Every one of them is much better than this monkey over here. It's the sad bear markets that are my specialty. I thrive on things like Bear rallies, Stagflation, Depression, Recession and listening to people talk about their ex. So whenever those fears start coming back again, you will be hearing a lot from me each and every single  week. I don't care if things become bearish for 10yrs, you will still hear from me. And that is my promise to you. WSB.

Enough of my BS, but this time we wont rewind the week. Instead, lets get to the point quickly

&amp;#x200B;

\-&gt; Max cap $47.5B/m starting June 1 and 95B/m starting september 1. But theoretically we would never achieve it. Hence $85B/m max cap. Will explain later why. Last cycle the max we went was $50B/m.

\-&gt; Market is already anticipating Qt, hence bonds are selling off. By the end of 2024 Fed will remove $2T/8.6T from the system.

\-&gt; This money goes into RRP. It's like a black hole for excess liquidity sucking deposits out of the banking system into money market funds.

\-&gt; In picture above, area b/w white line is tightening, which begins with rate increases and when rates around 1% QT starts. Red lines are Qt announced and begin one month after. The orange line is when we will pivot from rate hikes. Right now this cycle we dont know yet. Maybe June FOMC 13-14 economic projections will clear it. The green line will depict the QT end.

**Deep Analysis (Full credits to Blockworks Macro and especially to Maroon 5 &amp; Wang)**

Lets go deep dive and study the 11 most important questions which could be asked to us if we are going to become an investment banker for Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan. xD

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Interest rate on deposit lags even though there is an increase in interest rate in rrp when FED is hiking.**

&amp;#x200B;

This is so because banks have been stuffed with a lot of deposits over the last couple of years. The excess liquidity in the system should insulate it against a potential increase in deposit pricing from rate hikes, which should then benefit banks cost of funds and net interest margins as loan yields reprice faster than deposits.

&amp;#x200B;

A deposit beta = relative change in deposit / change in interest rate from Fed.

&amp;#x200B;

This indicator will be lagging the deposit betas in money market fund industry and are expected to rise more slowly than experienced in prior rate rising cycle given unprecedented levels of liquidity on balance sheets, the low level of alternative market interest rates and Fitch forecast for positive yet below average loan growth.

Banks are likely to allow excess deposits to run off before restricting deposits upwards, which should support net interest income and margins as banks control funding costs while taking advantage of higher asset yields.

Lets say Fed hikes 100bps rn with target 2.5% by end of the year. Your checking account is still 0 bps, so when Fed raises rates rrp goes higher and then money funds offer higher yields, so there might be competition there with commercial banks offering nothing. Hence there will be movement from banking sector to money market funds. By the way, money market funds have management fees anywhere, b/w lets says 25-50 bps. So if 100bps is the Fed funds rate right now, then investors only get 75-50bps.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why are bill yields trading below rrp? (rrp 30bps 4w bills at 20bps and 8w at 28bps)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[TGA vs RRP 1:1](https://preview.redd.it/og75evbb30391.png?width=1483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80c14552bcb5caceb475d2a23a84869fe8a8fd48)

&amp;#x200B;

Argument 1 :

&amp;#x200B;

Tga (Treasury general account) was very large. Now tga is coming down and rrp is going higher. This has been happening 1:1 recently.

Also, there is a bill shortage in front end which will partially feed into rrp action. The issuance of treasury over next 6-12m will probably input how long rrp stays large.

Part of the reason why money market funds don't want the treasury bill right now and rather stick it in rrp is because they are not profit seeking entities. Their first concern is the safety of their investment. Treasury fund are uncertain right now. They don't want duration risk. Although there is probably never going to be a loss for them since they will be holding them to maturity, but they don‚Äôt want to hold something which goes down in value when the Fed is hiking.

But if Treasury fed funds rate becomes certain and the treasury market start issuing some more bills and as banking system maybe starts to bid deposit away from money market fund as reserve balance starts to get scarce, probably will start to see rrp come down in 6m or so, then treasury might become attractive.

In the beginning period of Qt we might see rrp go up.

Ex : Lets say a 2yr Treasury bill costs $100 and fed hikes so the price now is $98. You will never realize this loss. But you'll see red so they park in rrp. Rrp is like Fed's attempt to supply collateral to a market that has too much liquidity.

Money market funds are very conservative about what they buy. They wake up everyday  and park money in rrp because you cant really buy anything else that makes sense. Yields are below rrp and extremely low. If you're a money market fund, you get inflows. Lets say a bill is trading 30bps below rrp at 50bps. So you can go and just invest 80bps at rrp.

&amp;#x200B;

Argument 2 :

&amp;#x200B;

But currently one can argue with another reason why the bill is trading below rrp.

Part of the reason bills are at low yields is because the fed is cutting issuance. Also, we had to sell off stocks and bonds so that money went to cash. Cash for a lot of people is a treasury bill. They are very short term investment. Money that pays interest. So a lot of people are buying that at the same time supply is getting cut. This quarter, Fed will cut 450B following the quarter 150B of treasury bill issuance.

Less supply, more demand pushes yields low and rrp, thereby trading above in yields.

&amp;#x200B;

Argument 3 :

&amp;#x200B;

But there is a a third group of experts that believes this so because of the collateral shortfall. A monetary deflation perhaps, and the time is running out.

An extra premium for pristine form of pristine form collateral because they wanna buy a treasury bill and take loss rather than lend cash out and take bill as collateral.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3. What impact will Fed and government have on higher than expected tax receipts and lower treasury borrowing schedules on yields with Qt?**

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know coupon rates have an important effect on the treasury. Since the Fed is about to issue more longer term treasury and also the repo facility can only invest in the shorter term so it feels like the longer term treasury is screwed.

But it's not that easy. There's a lot of other factor involved beside just supply and demand dynamics. Supply being Treasury, will be issuing more longer term bonds and demand being Fed, will reinvest less of its maturing security and only to shorter term bonds.

Long term bonds are influenced by economic conditions, too. If we are heading into a slowdown, which it does feel like, then the duration of these bonds will start appealing to investors.

As we head further down the road, the duration will probably catch a bid regardless of increased issue and lack of reinvestment from Fed.

If inflation remains at 8% till the end of the year, then long term bonds catching a bid will be near certainty.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Will the ‚ÄúBond bear market‚Äù continue?**

&amp;#x200B;

Yes and no.

&amp;#x200B;

A : ""Yes"" bond lover guy

Bonds will occasionally get a flight-to safety trade. We can already see 10yr rollover from 3.2% to 2.8%

&amp;#x200B;

B : ""No"" bond hater guy

But the formula for nominal yield = Inflation + growth

So you don't buy bonds when there is increasing inflation with some room for growth.

Also, if you have an asset that you created to infinity by printing trillions of dollars, eventually prices will go down.

And Fed has started to realize it. Every quarter there is this treasury borrowing advisory committee. They ask the private sector to make a presentation to them about certain things. Most recent one was whether or not trade due to volatility and issuance will be okay for the treasury market. So Fed will be late to solve the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal take :

In the past, Qt has led to bond yields crashing lower because the flight-to safety trade swamped everything. In the beginning period bonds sell off a bit and during the last period they end up more than 100bps lower than they started. But history doesn't repeat it rhymes. So i think market has front-runned the Qt cycle in last 3-4 months.

But there will be a lot more factors to consider.

\- Lockdown in china

\- Ukraine russia war

\- Global food supply

\- Other fundamental and commodity factor

\- Rapid roll over inflation or a little bit less transitory and persistent sticky inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**5. In last 2-3yrs size of US treasury market have increased significantly, but treasury repo market has basically not increased much?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[US treasury market up](https://preview.redd.it/f8y90pns30391.png?width=1533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1474c53ead87b2a66e19dbf0413020c38b2bf189)

[Rrp market still down](https://preview.redd.it/n0edm59q30391.png?width=1545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb1e316792870e25bf65717d240081984ec4144)

&amp;#x200B;

Lots of investors who buy US treasury securities are not real money investors like pension funds. They are relative value funds. If repo volumes don't pick up, these are like levered non-bank financial institutions who have less room to absorb some of the increased treasury issuance, so this will all put pressure on the repo market if the usa treasury issue gets a bit larger.

When the usa issues a treasury, someone has to buy it. There are two parties.

Cash buyer : real money , pension fund

Levered buyer : they get money by borrowing in repo market.

&amp;#x200B;

The way the federal reserve enacts a lot of changes in financial markets are basically not necessarily through direct actions of the federal reserve like raising fed funds rates or 90B dollars of Qt but basically by talking to markets.

So the market is tightening itself. Its banks starting to back down hatches. Some tech stocks are getting marked down. Bunch of capital having little bit of implosion in MBS selling off. Its like the market is reacting to itself and anticipating things to happen and sort of acting now as opposed to reacting when those changes are actually going to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Is Fed going to sell treasury this yr before maturity?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[MBS won't mature and will go down to $15B in 2024, but enough for first 3m i.e. 17.5B\/m](https://preview.redd.it/2m3ag0tz30391.png?width=1895&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35dcb1874465301b90c27af5362f74de55cf52fe)

&amp;#x200B;

Starting June 1 till next 3m, Fed max cap of selling securities will be 47.5B/m = 35B/m treasury bonds + 17.5B/m mortgage-backed security.

Starting September 1 till next 3m, Fed max cap of selling securities will be 95B/m = 60B/m treasury bonds + 35B/m mortgage-backed security.

As interest rate on Mbs rises because of tightening in financial markets and interest rate increases, it has extended the effective duration of Mbs. Mbs is a bit different to treasuries. Basically, you can refinance your house anytime you want. You can also prepay your mortgage, but treasury bonds have a fixed maturity. As rate increases it has affected the portfolio of Mbs. Meaning less of them mature early on than Fed expected. So MBS will be maturing at 20-25B/m as opposed to 35B/m in september.

A lot of discussion is being held that Fed will sell Mbs. This is something Fed hasn't done before. One thing they can do is rather than sell their maturities from its portfolio, they can let them passively mature and run off that way without reinvesting them. They won't actually sell security to the open market.

Fed just cannot sell Mbs because of lot of other complications in market. The Mbs the Fed owns right now are basically off the run. So they're issued at lower coupons than the market is currently trading.

Most Fed portfolio is 2-2.5% &amp;

Most market coupon 4-5%

The market isn't very liquid at the moment if they sell $1T of Mbs.

Mbs are special in itself because they are 30yr loan. You can prepay it anytime you want.

Ex : 5% mortgage, interest rate went down 3% then i can get new loan to repay old loan.

When that happens the yield loan gets paid down and shows up as a prepayment for whoever holds the bond.

But since we are starting from a low mortgage rate, say 2.5-3.5%. So no prepayment so no one will ever refinance. The only way these bonds will get paid off is through monthly principal + interest payments,, which is a slow process.

Hence its all up to Fed to call how Qt will happen for MBS.

Mortgage paydowns are proceeding okay until 2024. Then it gets kind of low to about $15B. That's probably slow, but we all know something will blow up when it does happen and then Fed will inject Qe+. So all asset classes will moon once again or we are in a ‚ÄúGreat depression‚Äù

Chart b/w spread b/w mortgage yields and 10yr treasury widened a lot. That's Qt working.

**8. Deep dive on balance sheet capacity?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Banks guidelines](https://preview.redd.it/037k0yu940391.png?width=1261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8c34995af915a777cea7ab1656d822c2f71e69d)

Here are the terms that you should google and learn more about.

SLR , RWA , differential accounting guidelines, diff b/w notable and non notable transactions, VAR limit, haircuts, collateral velocity, IM VM requirement etc.

These all influence ability of financial institutions to construct their balance sheet and conduct financial transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*Warning\*\*\*\*\*\* : This sh9t will f@#k you up. Don‚Äôt read. It‚Äôs just a rant.

&amp;#x200B;

Basel 3 in brief :

[https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424\_inbrief.pdf](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424_inbrief.pdf)

[https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsisummaries/b3\_lrf.pdf](https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsisummaries/b3_lrf.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

SLR (Supplementary leverage ratio) : In the USA it its a part of Basel III tier 1 guidelines with which banks calculate the amount of common equity capital they must hold relative to their total leverage exposure. Large US banks must hold 3%.

There's a two set of guidelines that are supposed to be governing how banks construct their balance sheets one is SLR, a risk-asset-neutral leverage ratio. So basically it just governs how leveraged overall banks could be.

One of the most important changes to basel III as compared to earlier versions of basel is that this is gonna be a non-risk-weighed measure, which means it also captures all sorts of activities, right. So it captures things like over-the-counter, off balance sheet like derivatives, as well as sort of balance sheet activities like repo.

Fed's intention is to regulate SLR to be a binding constraint on the balance sheet. It's supposed to be more like a backstop.

It then engages banks to be a different kind of behavior. A couple of years ago we got a new novel marketing invention right before the time of the repo blow that may have facilitated the repo blow-up in 2019. It was called ""Sponsored Repo"" born out of frustration or response to a lot of these balance sheet restrictions.

The problem : For normal repo transactions they count, so $1 of repo counts $1 against your assets for SLR. This leads to a problem where repo is relatively historically been a high volume but low spread business.

So now you have an SLR that basically gives you a fixed limit of how much asset you can own on the balance sheet. You don't want to do these high volume, low spread businesses. You want to do low volume, high spread business.

This basically incentivizes banks on margin to get out of traditional repo and into sponsored repo or into activities that have more favourable accounting treatment like FI swaps. These are similar to repo transactions. Its basically a collaterized loan by another currency. But FI swaps have favourable accounting compared to repo transactions. This basically leads to situations where banks have to choose b/w various kinds of activities. They are more likely to choose activities that have more favourable accounting treatment.

So this all leads to basically all sorts of problems where you have incentives which are not necessarily economic in nature. You have sort of regulatory incentives in the past, Basel 1 and 2 where you loan your $100 of mortgage to a subprime borrower where there's a $100 of mortgage on your balance sheet. If package this into MBS then its diversified and accounts only 50%. If you pair this with CDS then this accounts for only 20% against risk-weighted assets ( RWA)

So basically as a result of how these guidelines are stretched, you can have 5x more exposure essentially through different types of instrument. We can talk about whether this is justified or not because to some extent you know if you have CDS on subprime Mbs, it is safer than holding just subprime loans. So it all depends on what type of assets banks want to hold.

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets talk about the underrated driving force. The money multiplier.

Its a ratio of monetary base to amount of loans or deposits.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier#:\~:text=Money%20multiplier%20%3D%201%20%2F%20RR%2C,ratio%20set%20by%20the%20Fed.](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier#:~:text=Money%20multiplier%20%3D%201%20%2F%20RR%2C,ratio%20set%20by%20the%20Fed.)

&amp;#x200B;

Invisible money multiplier :

As these haircuts, collateral velocity or how SLR governs the counting treatment of different types of assets that base could hold. It changes the invisible money multiplier on different types of assets on how much banks can lever up on these assets, &amp; it changes the structure and the favourable accounting treatment for different types of assets in financial systems.

Meaning banks can add hundreds of dollars of long term-duration Treasury bonds viewed as risk-off hedges to their balance sheet &amp; it has nothing to do with deflation or depression coming. It could basically be due to a change in the SLR exemption ratio.

A lot of banks have to deal with regulatory concerns. Ex : Banks make loan to business. There are going to be capital changes under regulation that add to the cost that a bank incurs. But if banks were to buy the treasury, there'd be no capital changes. So there is leverage ratio but no risk-based measure so it could be cheaper for them to buy treasury and so that could be their part of consideration.

Not to mention, but they have a whole bunch of liquidity regulation. They kind of have to buy liquid assets like treasuries or cheap reserves. for ex : They could be holding on to these assets simply due to huge optimization problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary :  Regulation plays an important role in what banks can do or not. So we should not read into anything macro what they are doing with their asset book.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**9. We keep hearing ""Banks dont need reserves to make loan"" so why does it matter if the quality of reserves in the system decreases? Reserves are mostly in excess nowadays no?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Balance sheet of Banks](https://preview.redd.it/rltkfbxk40391.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7516e905077e516f42da07c366d40c816b877743)

Reserve requirements were eliminated in March April 2020. Whatever reserve requirements used to be, they don't exist anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11256.pdf](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11256.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

There was a research paper which called for some alternative monetary facts. They talk about this myth that money multipliers banks need reserves to make loans. They provide that in 2007 JPM had 0.1% of its its assets in actual reserves. Banks needed to have 10% at that time.

Banks need reserves in order to settle transactions with each other. They don't need reserves to make loans in the first place. But if deposits that are created by those loans were to be transferred to another bank, then they would need reserves to settle with that bank. So they would transfer deposit + reserves. So basically these reserves are lent to subtle transaction b/w banks. They are used to lend in both the repo and FX markets. So banks need reserves to settle inter bank transactions by both buying and selling as well as lending and borrowing. But they are not necessary to make loan.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Concept of money**

&amp;#x200B;

Basic :

[https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/24-1-what-is-money/](https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/24-1-what-is-money/)

&amp;#x200B;

Fed made rule : Treasuries would not count as assets and then banks loaded up on treasuries and people were like banks are betting on depression. Basically, they were giving free amounts of leverage to hold. Leverage is defined as assets/equity.

FX swaps &amp; interest swaps are money in some sense because these when you combine with loan and security, might allow you to hold more of these loan and securities, which basically allows you to have more purchasing power over these kind of assets.

&amp;#x200B;

Value at risk :

What kind of assets banks can hold. A certain type of risk measure which Hfs and different types of financial institutions use that basically tells them how volatile an asset is historically or with 30D look back period. Basically, how much velocity is acceptable for that asset.

Ex $100M portfolio of security at 10%. The max amount you should lose is 10% if the historical distribution holds.

So if $200M then its 5%

$400M then 2.5%

$1B then 1% mark.

A lot of these concepts are fungible. In all, money isn't bank deposits or reserves.

&amp;#x200B;

Balance sheet capacity :

1 unit of balance sheet space, however you define it to be, allows you to take 1 unit of additional risk exposure or 1 unit of additional purchasing power.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Volatility and its impacts on bonds+stock market**

&amp;#x200B;

If volatility goes up, many things become less money-like.

If volatility is low, you can trade your assets for bank deposits or something else.

If volatility is high + no liquidity then you will not be able to easily convert your assets into bank deposits.

There was an unprecedented volatility in US treasury market during march 2020.  We saw huge bids from treasuries and sell-offs. Hf's basis trade blowing up. You also had foreign institutions trying to sell treasuries and get into cash, but the US treasury market became frozen and unusable for a period of several days. This was not supposed to happen and be the most liquid market in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a blog post in NY: Fed.

[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/04/treasury-market-liquidity-during-the-covid-19-crisis/](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/04/treasury-market-liquidity-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)

&amp;#x200B;

They looked at dealer under SLR. During March 2020 they didn't behave differently, but the commentary is that it wasn't that they were bound by SLR except because volatility was too high.

just to protect themselves, dealers weren't able to prepare the market as they used to. If there is a wide bid ask spread treasuries are moving a lot, you dont know what the right price is. So you don't want to warehouse risk. So you pull back market activity and hence people can't sell.

Hence, treasuries became less money-like.

&amp;#x200B;

VIX at 16 with leverage 4x ( S&amp;P moves 1% in a day ) = VIX at 64 ( S&amp;P moves 4% in a day )

Volatility is high derisk, whereas low volatility means lever up and go crazy.

In 2020, no one could sell treasury when people wanted to basis harvesting by buying cash treasury and selling in futures. The spread kept widening before it converged. Hence, people were forced to add more collateral and eat losses.

Since 2008, the equity of banks is still growing, but their assets have actually declined because of restrictions in balance sheet capacity.

High volume with less tolerance for risk led to the collapse of leverage in the financial system.

Hence we wont drain $3T from balance sheet. Something is bound to break before that.

&amp;#x200B;

At last i will throw in charts of Fed rate projection and housing market. Be careful while analyzing them.

## 1. [EQT Corporation (EQT)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-EQT/)

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe‚Äôs gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

## 2. [General Motors (GM)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-GM/)

General Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

Point 1: Metaverse is still minor investment 

Meta is in the name, but that was to include the family of apps as equals - you don't think Alphabet is only going to teach kids the letters on Mr. Rogers. Get it together - 80% of cash is spent on the core business. 

The core business is displaying ads. The $30B capex investment is for just that purpose - showing higher converting ads.   


Point 2: Meta doesn't want to be cool

Meta is built for people who shop at Walmart and your grandma. The same way we waste our time on this site, every demographic has a platform, and the vast majority of those demographics use a Family of Apps product.

TikTok, Youtube, Twitter (with Elon) are going to be cooler. However, facebook/insta are replacing shit, not your trip to an underground Wes Anderson inspired photo exhibit in LA.

There are rumors that [CrowdStrike is targeting an Israeli firm for an acquisition](https://jewishbusinessnews.com/2022/07/27/crowdstrike-to-spend-2-billion-buying-israeli-firms-report/) that could approach $2 billion. Israel is a hotbed for cybersecurity startups, and CrowdStrike faces competition from Israeli-founded companies like SentinelOne (S).

There is precedent here: [CrowdStrike acquired Preempt Security](https://www.techzine.eu/news/security/50362/crowdstrike-acquires-preempt-security-for-96m/) in 2020 to boost Zero Trust. Alphabet has also dipped into these waters, recently acquiring Siemplify for around $500 million. CrowdStrike needs to stay on the cutting edge and acquiring innovative startups before competitors swallow them is essential.

Reporting on CrowdStrike's plan has been minimal, but there could be an announcement made on the earnings call or a hint from management if they are asked about the rumors.

**CrowdStrike Key Metrics**

As always, there are some key metrics to watch for CrowdStrike. They can indicate future catalysts or warn investors of dangerous trends. This is even more vital with a fast-growing, difficult-to-value software company.

**Subscription customers**

The first metric I look for in each earnings release is the number of subscription customers and the gains made in the quarter. CrowdStrike spends a tremendous amount on sales and marketing (S&amp;M) to attract new customers, and investors need to know they are getting terrific results. The chart below shows the company's revenue and S&amp;M expenses for the past several quarters.

https://i.imgur.com/XkmnaG2.png

As we can see, CrowdStrike spent 34% of revenue on sales last quarter on a non-GAAP basis and 40% on a GAAP basis. So far, it appears to be working.

The company has been phenomenal at luring customers, as shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/fBgI9TZ.png).

Customers reached 17,945 last quarter on 57% gains. The percentage growth will shrink as the numbers rise; however, the total number gained will hopefully accelerate. Look for CrowdStrike to report 19,300 on the low end and 20,000 if they have an absolute blockbuster.

**Dollar-based retention rates**

Dollar-based net retention (DBNR) rate measures the amount of revenue provided by existing clients from year to year. For instance, existing customers spend more with the company this year than last; the DBNR will be over 100%.

This is vitally important to CrowdStrike because of the massive investment in S&amp;M and because much of its success will hinge on convincing customers to adopt more modules. Organic sales growth is less expensive than attracting new customers and entrenches clients with the business.

CrowdStrike set a goal of 120% or above for the fiscal 2023 DBNR. They achieved this in Q1, and investors should look for this in Q2 as well. In fact, CrowdStrike has exceeded 120% each quarter since Q1 FY19. Anything less than 120% would be concerning.

**Free cash flow and annual recurring revenue**

Of course, we can't look at CrowdStrike's results without discussing the top-line revenue figure and annual recurring revenue (ARR). ARR is total subscription revenue annualized. ARR is an excellent leading indicator of sales growth.

CrowdStrike reported $1.9 billion ARR last quarter, 61% YOY growth. The company would need ARR to reach $2.16 billion this quarter to keep up this pace. Anything over this would be a terrific win. This quarter, look for ARR to hit $2.1 billion as a solid benchmark.

Free cash flow (FCF) has seen a dramatic improvement as CrowdStrike has grown. This is an indication that the business model will be profitable at scale. CrowdStrike reported $293 million in FCF in FY21 and $442 million in FY22. Last quarter saw a record $158 million, putting the company on pace to exceed $600 million this fiscal year. FCF can fluctuate for several one-off reasons, but investors should expect an FCF margin above 30%.

**The wrap-up**

Cybersecurity is a high-growth industry with the potential to accelerate. There is always a catalyst lurking. Cyberattacks and breaches are commonplace and becoming a standard during conflicts. This means that companies, organizations, and governments must protect against criminals looking to profit, state-sponsored attackers, and everything in between.

CrowdStrike continues to be a leader in the industry and may be seeking to add to its repertoire through acquisition. If the company does not announce, an analyst should ask the question during the earnings call, and the answer could provide clues.

The price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratios have come down this year but are still indicative of a company with massive growth ahead. Industry trends point to CrowdStrike beating estimates, so I think it would be smart to get calls. This is not investment advice obviously, but just my opinion. 

9/2 200c is only $5.50/share, so I'm going with those.","CrowdStrike's earnings are tonight, this is why I'm getting 9/2 calls on it",1.0,2022-08-30 16:48:27
792,1661453094,wxm27h,1," The outlook for $CMG appears to be bright. In fact, over the past several years, the estimates for the current- and following-year revenue have consistently risen with the small exception of the beginning of the covid outbreak.  Today $CMG is trading at about $1,650.00 per share, a cost that's far out of reach of many an average investor interested in buying a piece of the fast-food market. There are also its restaurant employees, who might want to invest as well but don't have a few grand to drop to do so. (They could, of course, buy fractional shares at many brokerages if they wanted to).  

Chipotle reported disappointing sales this quarter as price hikes helped boost profits but may have scared away some inflation-weary customers.

**Here's the juice:**  During the second quarter, Chipotle‚Äôs board approved an additional $300 million to repurchase shares of the company. 

This is just their initial approval and there are talks of more buybacks to come. When buybacks occur, stock prices go up. Chipotle is already trading at a price far too high for low income investors. Companies often choose to split their stock prior to buybacks to keep their stock attractive to investors. And that is what's about to happen. Stock splits have become somewhat of a trend the past two years as we've seen with Alphabet, Tesla, and Amazon. Chipotle is a strong company and knows what they're doing. Expect to see a split within the next month. Take it as you will.

796,1660688306,wq7ewx,1,"#####**Idea:**

Have a semi controlled, fully randomized way of picking individual stocks that all of WSB can start buying/hyping/trading and making $$$$ on which will cause the rest of the retail market to bandwagon onto causing multiple BBBY‚Äôs regularly. While causing headaches and head scratching for everyone else.

#####**How**

Either daily, monthly, quarterly or however WSB decides. Randomly pick 1 stock(or more) to jump onto. Then start buying (or shorting if you‚Äôre a mean ape) for a specific period of time. Obviously when you jump onto or off the rocket is up to you. And that‚Äôs the fun part!

But how as a community do we pick a stock truly randomly and do so in a trustworthy fashion‚Ä¶.? We don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. the lottery does. We use state lotteries(or other similar means) number drawing to pick the stocks for us.

EG‚Ä¶ Tie the alphabet to the mega millions drawing. #1 ball is letter A, #2 ball letter B,  etc, etc. You can have every number represent a letter more than once. Than the lottery is drawn. And the corresponding numbers equal the ticker of the month!(*toy story chosen one meme*). Drawing comes out‚Ä¶.  35, 64, 10, 12, 24 mega ball 15. BAM! ‚ÄòDOLE‚Äô is now the ticker of the quarter!!

This is very versatile. You could choose the first mega millions drawing of the month as the decider for the next ticker. People know when the date and time of the drawing is, it‚Äôs 100% transparent as far as WSB involvement goes. The drawing happens, the decoding is done and **BOOM**,  you‚Äôre off! Maybe you want to short it. Maybe everyone starts buying but everyone bails on day 3. Who‚Äôs left hodling the bags. Or maybe it goes hard into day 20, outside retail traders are getting in, now. The hype has spread to twitter‚Ä¶. Do you stay in longer? Do you jump ship? 

#####Why:

Cause why the fuck not? If GME pissed off congress/regulators this should be just as fun. Random as fuck stocks taking off 20% daily for ape reasons. I‚Äôm sure in a day or two you‚Äôll hear a blurb about BBBY on your local news. 

#####Further Ideas:

Incentives. You can make long competitions or short ones, mini ‚Äúprizes‚Äù for people who cleaned up the best. Or for that fool who lost the worse. Make a prize for those who make the first of the selected ticker a ticker drawing‚Ä¶. Think Bingo, bango, bongo. You can have daily ticker drawings, weekly, quartly, etc. The sky is the limit I think. I know the cryptards have their ‚Äúmoons‚Äù for rewards idk what could be done here. But I think this overall idea is very feasible and would really spice up our bananas.",WSB coordinated but randomized stock buying... Contest? Game? Ape shit?

DUBAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Public Investment Fund (PIF) bought shares in Alphabet¬†(GOOGL.O), Zoom Video¬†(ZM.O)¬†and Microsoft¬†(MSFT.O)¬†as part of a wider pick of U.S. stocks, bringing the market value of the sovereign wealth fund's investment portfolio to about $40.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.

The PIF acquired 213,000 class A shares in Alphabet, 4.7 million class A shares in Zoom and 1.8 million shares in Microsoft, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.

801,1659384531,wdr3vr,1,"So recently Gamestop has issued a 4:1 stock split **in form of a stock dividend**. In recent memory Tesla and Alphabet did the same with no hiccups.

[Press release](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-four-one-stock-split)

So the way it should work the transfer agent of Gamestop (Computershare) creates 3 new shares for every existing share. Then they give the dividend of 3 new shares per every old share to all the shares that are directly registered with them and give the remaining shares to the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) that should take care of distributing the shares to the brokers, who have the shares in the street name aka fugazis (no broker has any stock certificates, all US stock certifactes that are not directly registered with the company's transfer agent are held on behalf of the DTCC by Cede&amp;Co.).

The DTCC should have a record of the number of shares that belong to the depositories (subsidiary of the DTCC in the US, Clearstream in the EU), so they should distribute the stock dividend they got from Computershare to the Depositories, and the Depositories should to the same to Clearing Brokers, which should do the same to the Brokers.

&amp;#x200B;

We now have plenty of evidence that this is not what happened, and instead after receiving the stock dividend the DTCC just told all the depositories to treat it like a regular stock split (multiple all the fugazis by four).

It first came to light when the German clearing broker DWP Bank decided to reverse the stock split and correctly issue a stock dividend. This caused German shareholders to temporarily lose 3/4 of their shares. Some have it back already, some brokers using DWP Bank as their clearing broker still didn't issue the stock dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

[Statemnt from DKB Bank, a German broker using DWP Bank as their clearing broker](https://preview.redd.it/ia7u5gies5f91.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c64592f4bb897997bc7399dfdede128a996142b3)

Then the German Bank/Broker Comdirect that is AFAIK not associated with DWP Bank answered was answering questions about the Dividend on their forum, and after some initial confusion they came up with this answer:

&amp;#x200B;

[So I guess Gamestop is spreading rumors through their press release and SEC filings](https://preview.redd.it/kmuiys5qr5f91.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44d2b521410e0277a1fd32fe469180bf6bf3bf84)

After another probing questions from the apes the Comdirect team actually got an answer from the Depository (Clearstream)

&amp;#x200B;

So if this isn't the smoking gun I don't know what is. The DTCC received the Stock Dividend from Computershare and instead of distributing it they ignored it and told everyone to just make it a normal stock split.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For many people it is an important distinction because of:

1. Tax implications
2. People who registered their shares between the date of record and the ex-dividend date got no dividend or split, they're down 75%
3. MOASS theory

So firstly in most countries a stock dividend would be a taxable event, so for the shareholders it's good that it wasn't accounted as a stock dividend, but shouldn't various tax agencies around the world care?

Secondly, there's plenty of people who decided to DRS just before or after the date of record and their broker has send their shares to Computershare between the date of record and the ex-dividend date. That means that the broker should receive the Stock Dividend and forward it to Computershare. Instead all the brokers claim that the ex-dividend date doesn't matter, and since the shares were on Computershare on the ex-dividend date it's computershare that's responsible for the dividend (or rather multiplying the shares x4, IDK why the brokers called it a dividend here when DTCC says it's a stock split). Why the hell do we have a date of record at all then?? Both Computershare and brokers stand firm and those people are SOOL and lost 3/4 of their shares.

Thirdly, many people, me included, think that the whole debacle proves that the amount of synthetic shares from naked shorting, be it illegal naked shorting or market maker privilege, makes it impossible for the DTCC to distribute the stock dividend without trigerring MOASS (because there's not enough dividend shares for the synthetic shares, so that would trigger a mandatory buyback)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I think this is time for legal action. I think first in-line should be the people who did not receive their dividend and didn't get their shares split, because Computershare got their shares after the date of record. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know how should those people proceed. Should they all individually sue their broker? Should they pursue class-action suits against their respective brokers?

803,1659368552,wdkkpw,1," New highs in the stock market could arrive a lot sooner than investors expect, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.

He said the S&amp;P 500 could hit new highs before year-end as the 2022 bear market is over.

""When bad news doesn't take down markets, it is time for investors to assess,"" Lee said.

The stock market could be gearing up for new record highs before year-end as the 2022 bear market is over, Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Friday.

""The biggest takeaway for me on events of this week? Convincing and arguably decisive evidence the 'bottom is in' ‚Äî the 2022 bear market is over,"" he said.

Lee's confidence stems from the fact that between a negative GDP print, another 75-basis-point interest rate hike from the Fed, and more natural gas volatility due to Russia's Nord Stream pipeline drama, a lot of bad news occurred this week and yet the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 managed to stage a 3% rally.

""When bad news doesn't take down markets, it is time for investors to assess,"" Lee said.

On the earnings front, despite a strong US dollar and heightened economic uncertainty, companies are reporting better-than-feared results. With 52% of the S&amp;P 500 having reported second-quarter earnings already, 73% beat profit estimates by a median 7%.

Earnings matter because in the long term that's what drives stock prices.

Results from mega-cap tech behemoths Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all eased investor concerns about the resilience of their growth and their ability to manage inflation, which helped drive considerable gains in their stock prices this week.

Lee believes the economy has reached the pivot point where incoming data will be decisively less negative, and disinflation tailwinds are set to strengthen. Commodities from metals to oil to grains have been on the decline in recent weeks, which has already resulted in some price declines for consumers.

""On the other hand, if he says we're doing the triple-rate hike and then we're willing to keep tightening no matter what, including a possible inter-meeting hike if the CPI stays hot, then we are definitely going lower,"" he added, referring to June's hotter-than expected 9.1% inflation reading.

The Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and many analysts expect a 75 basis point rate hike. 

Cramer also previewed this week's slate of earnings. All earnings and revenue estimates are courtesy of FactSet.

809,1658846608,w8ll0v,1,"Ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech earnings later this week, Ed Yardeni has some words of comfort: the worst has passed for this bear market.

In the view of the Yardeni Research president, the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs plunge last month to a 3,666.77 low likely marked the trough of the 2022 equity rout. Underpinning the sanguine call is the resilience in corporate earnings and the still-healthy outlook for consumers and businesses even as the economy slows.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never easy to pick a bottom in the stock market, but I‚Äôm going to give it a try,‚Äù Yardeni said on Bloomberg TV. ‚ÄúThe real question is going to be the earnings season, and so far the earnings season is going reasonably well. It has not really thrashed the stock market, and the stock market‚Äôs held up quite well.‚Äù

The statement is a large one ahead of a decisive week -- the Fed looks all set for another supersized interest-rate hike on Wednesday, while most mega-cap technology companies, including Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon, Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, will release their earnings reports.

Yardeni appears to be in the minority. In Bank of America Corp.‚Äôs survey this month, money managers said they‚Äôve cut their equity exposure to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, a sign of no faith in recent market bounce. At the end of June, a Deutsche Bank AG poll showed 72% of respondents expected the S&amp;P 500 to fall to 3,300 first, rather than rallying to 4,500.

But if Yardeni‚Äôs track record is any indication, it‚Äôs worth heeding the view of a market veteran who coined terms like ‚ÄúFed Model‚Äù and ‚Äúbond vigilante.‚Äù The strategist, who worked at Oak Associates Ltd. and Deutsche Bank before founding his namesake research firm, called the equity bottom the same month when the 1982 bear market ended. He then repeated the success in March 2009 when the S&amp;P 500 reached an intraday low of 666.79 -- 3,000 points below this year‚Äôs trough in what he calls another ‚Äúdevilish number.‚Äù

813,1658518671,w5jbnz,1,"**Brief Bear Case for $META (tl;dr)**: 

After ER misses from $SNAP &amp; $TWTR, falling FB &amp; IG App Store metrics, and continued dominance from TikTok, $META puts into earnings look like a reasonable trade. However, with an IV rank of 94% (IV has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. If you don‚Äôt have time to read, that means I‚Äôm arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring July 29th ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings.

**First, some facts:**

* $META carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.

üì∑

* February 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% ‚Äî the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02B.
* $META shares recently reached a fresh &gt;2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.
   * Prior to that, $META reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20.¬†
      * How brief? The week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $META closed at $154.34 ‚Äî $0.09 above its most recent June low.¬†
      * The week following (beginning 3/23/20) $META closed at $156.79 ‚Äî $2.54 above its most recent low.
      * Outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $META has respected the $154 level since early 2019.

üì∑

* Since reporting earnings in February of 2022, shares of $META have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758.¬†
   * Despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in April of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.
   * The bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $META‚Äôs pandemic low of $137.10.

üì∑

* TikTok continues to dominate Facebook, Instagram and Messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.

üì∑

* On a list of the top grossing apps in the US, Tiktok places 3rd, Facebook places 84th. Instagram and Messenger are too low to feature.

üì∑

* Lastly, Zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of Meta.¬†
   * [Meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)
   * CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.

&gt;""If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&amp;A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.

**Conclusion**: 

BearishIn the wake of $SNAP and $TWTR missing earnings on the top and bottom line, Tiktok‚Äôs continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $META shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings this Thursday. 

However, with a 94% IV rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and IV crush to contend with, it‚Äôs critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.

**The Trade Structure**: Put Debit Spreads

**Safe**: Targeting the $155 support level.¬†

**Lotto**: Target the $137 support level if $META breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it‚Äôs downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.

For July 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** ‚Äî Risking $6.00 for a profit of $9.00, breakeven of $164 and maximum value of $15.00 if $META satisfies its 10.5% expected move.¬†

**OR** 

For July 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** ‚Äî Risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $META has another outsized earnings move like it did in February, targeted at the next area of support.

**Alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts ‚Äî Risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $META falls to it‚Äôs pandemic low.¬†

No matter which trade you pick, it‚Äôs important to collect at least *some* premium on this. Holding through earnings is risky business, IV crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, OTM options, which is why we want to target the ATM $170 strike for our long position.¬†

**Trade Headwinds**:¬†

* $META‚Äôs earnings report falls on July 27th, after market close ‚Äî directly in between the FOMC‚Äôs next rate hike meeting (July 26th) and directly before we get QoQ GDP data (July 28th, 8:30 AM EST). That means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $META earnings and GDP data. If the GDP reaction is bad, that‚Äôs a big tailwind. If the GDP reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can‚Äôt afford from a time basis.
* Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reports are due on July 26th ‚Äî right before $META. A positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.

Despite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $META ahead of earnings.¬†

**The Wrap Up**

Use $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings to target the current &gt;2 year low and an average move of 10.5% ‚Äî OR ‚Äî Target the $137 pandemic low if you‚Äôre looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).

Introduction:

Hello fellow degenerates, I am back after a brief hiatus. I got way too caught up in work, holiday shenanigans, and lots of other BS. However, I am finally back on my horse and I am ready to bring some more smooth-brained DD to you all. I have been on a bit of a cold streak lately with my positions but I‚Äôve got a feeling this is the Aaron Judge 450 foot homer I have been seeking. What I will be doing with this post is simply a general DD on the current state of the market. I am going to present topics and attempt to give as objective a take as one man can. Full disclosure however in that before even diving into any research, I myself am very bearish on the markets in the short term. What I will be taking a position in come market open tomorrow is the SPY ETF. For those of you who have consumed more crayons than myself, the SPY ETF refers to the S&amp;P 500 index and is weighted accordingly to the index fund itself. It is heaviest in technology stocks (24.66%) however it is very diverse also holding healthcare (15.08%), financial services (12.86%), consumer cyclical (10.66%), communication services (9.1%), industrials (8.14%), consumer defensive (7.28%), energy (4.18%), utilities (2.99%), real estate (2.86%), and basic materials (2.19%). Additionally, the top 10 individual holdings within SPY are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Nvidia. In total they make up 27.72% of SPY‚Äôs total assets. All that being said, let‚Äôs dive into this irrational cesspool that we currently call a market.

&amp;#x200B;

Consumer Price Index (June YoY &amp; MoM) \- Wednesday

The consumer price index is expected to come in at an annual rate of 8.8% year over year with month over month expected to come in at 0.6%. As everyone knows, inflation has been running rampant and crushing economists' expectations lately leading to the current falls in general markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

Well, if the CPI comes in at or under economists expectations I believe a massive market rally will ensue on the news that will unfortunately cause some damage to the puts that I plan on partaking in. The reason the market will rally is simply because that would show inflation has possibly peaked and therefore Jerome Powell and our central bank may consider not being as hawkish and utilizing a less aggressive rate hike at their next meeting in a few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

If the CPI comes in above already lofty expectations, I expect the market to take another dive back to previous lows set in June, quite possibly surpassing them in the coming weeks. This would be because in addition to the surprise in total nonfarm payrolls smashing expectations, this would show that the U.S. economy is still running hot currently and the 75 basis point rate hike discussed at the most recent FOMC Minutes would be more than justified. In an unbelievably red hot inflation scenario, word could spread of a possible full percent (100 bps) hike which would undoubtedly obliterate the SPY and cause puts to more than print. My evidence for this statement is to look at what the market did in June after ONE 75 basis point hike and high CPI data. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Retail Sales (MoM) - Friday 

Retail sales are expected to come in at 0.9% for the month of June. Previously, Retail sales came in at -0.3% which should in theory signal a possible coming recession due to the slower consumption of retail goods by Americans. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

If Retail Sales come in below expectations or especially if they come in negative this time yet again, this also will signal an incoming recession and again could trigger the Fed to lighten up on the rate hikes which could cause a bullish bounce of sorts or even a market rebound as investors come to expect the easy money to return to the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

If retail sales come in above expectations this will signal consumers still have money in which they are willing to spend on retail goods which will incline the Fed to be more hawkish, which again would cause the markets to dump. Should we get a high CPI in conjunction with high retail sales, a 75 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting has a much higher probability of occurring. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Michigan Consumer Sentiment

First, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment is a monthly survey of how consumers feel about the economy, personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. The University of Michigan conducts at least 500 phone calls and covers personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions over 50 questions with US consumers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

Ironically, if US consumer sentiment drops to new all time lows this will be bullish for the market as again it will try to lean the Fed into a more dovish position and perhaps only hike rates 50 bps instead of the discussed 75 bps. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

Consumer sentiment rallies, defying expectations and shows optimism among American consumers. Again, if this and the CPI both follow the bearish take or all 3 I personally believe that this will be too much for markets and puts on the SPY will be in for some tendies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My Personal Opinion

Much of this is crystal ball guesswork my friends. I cannot tell you what will occur and if I could I wouldn‚Äôt still be giving dandy handies behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster. However, I do believe that CPI will come in higher than expected. This is due to past CPI coming in hotter than expected and most importantly this data is for the month of June. Energy prices, especially oil went berserk for the entirety of June which should carry CPI above expectations alone. Not only that but literally anything I have bought has continued to go up in price on a literal monthly basis. While my Hoosier ass is by no means a proxy for the entirety of inflation and the economy it is still telling. 

Additionally, I believe that one of the two following economic indicators (retail sales or consumer sentiment) will also follow a path that makes the Fed have to raise interest rates by at least 75 bps at their meeting in a few weeks. It is this interest rate raise that I believe will crush markets at least in the very near future. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Exit Plan:

By all means get greedy if you guys would like but I figured I would post my own thoughts for how I plan to proceed. I am going to buy 3 SPY $380 8/19 Puts at market open tomorrow morning. This is to get ahead of the economic indicators occurring this week and quite possibly make a nice 25% on my investment before the market even closes Friday. Personally I believe these contracts could do so by then and I would be happy with a \~$750 gain in a few days on a \~$3,000 investment. 

If I am wrong though and these contracts lose value as the market decides to rally, I will be doubling down on my position, putting all of my capital in and scooping up as many contracts as I can. I will more than likely do so on Friday after Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment data to hopefully get the best price per contract. 

In a worst case scenario, I will sell at a loss, selling all of my contracts on August 1st before Theta begins to obliterate my sweet cheeks more than it already will have by that point. This would be done to save some capital and have a chance at recouping my losses. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 

Higher than forecasted inflation + Higher than forecasted Consumer sentiment + Higher than forecasted Retail Sales = JPow hiking rates and sending us full speed ahead into a recession, crushing equities and therefore making lots of money for bears. If you do not comprehend the above sentence, here is a one month SPY chart, I‚Äôm buying $380 strike puts, I‚Äôm not asking for the apocalypse, just a nice short term dip, who cares what happens after. (SPY bottomed out at $362.17).
