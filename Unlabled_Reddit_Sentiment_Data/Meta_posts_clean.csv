**1.) She's smart**

Don't let the out of context interview clips fool you. Caroline graduated from Stanford with a mathematics degree and has MIT professor parents. She's been winning math competitions since high school. You want Ivy League children? You want Caroline.

**2.) She's cute**

*""but she likes weird polyamorous sex cults""*

Don’t get me wrong Zuckerberg is running that company in the ground with Meta. However, eventually he’s going to take such a big financial hit he’s open to dropping Meta. “But he’s already lost hundreds of billions” you are probably saying. Here’s the thing though, he still has FUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKKK YOOOOOOUUUUUU MONEY. That’s put your dick on the table, and stare everyone straight in the eyes while you do it money. The money he’s left with at this point is still so high it’s imaginary. The one way that number becomes real is if keeps on with Meta. I don’t know at what point in Zuck’s psychology he cracks, but he will eventually when the money he has left becomes “real”. At that point he’ll drop META and get back to Facebook. As beaten up as this stock is, and even with the overall market down this much, FB would be up insane percentages in a quarter or two following this news. Do I think we have more push to the downside before we get there? Yes, of course but ultimately if I’m right in my thinking, that could be the drop that makes Zuckerberg pivot his stance, even if he still believes in Meta the reality of the economy and situation would force his hand. However, at some point after the big dump off we’re headed for, META is probably a good play in a 1-3 year span.

* The S&amp;P 500 will fall to 3,200 points before it hits a low in Q2 next year, UBS has forecast.
* US stocks won't recover until the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, the bank said.
* ""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" UBS strategists said.

The S&amp;P 500 US stock index could fall another 16%, before bottoming out in nine months' time once the Federal Reserve switches away from hiking interest rates, UBS has forecast.

The Swiss bank's strategists laid out this scenario in a Monday note: ""Weak growth and earnings drag the market lower before a fall in rates helps it bottom at 3,200 in Q2 '23 and lifts it to 3,900 by end '23.""

The S&amp;P 500 would have to fall 15.9% from its Monday close at 3,806 to reach that low level.

The benchmark index has already slumped 20.1% year-to-date, weighed down by the Fed's tightening campaign, recession fears, and poor third-quarter earnings performances by Big Techs like Amazon and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.

UBS expects a slowdown in economic growth to carry on dragging stocks down until the second quarter. It also projected year-on-year global GDP will rise just 2.1% in 2023 — which would be the third-lowest expansion in the past three decades.

""Our forecast approaches something akin to a 'global recession',"" a UBS team led by chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note to clients.

""For the US, we now expect near zero growth in both 2023 and 2024, and a recession to start in 2023,"" they added.

That economic slump would likely lead to a period of disinflation, they said. Given the US central bank has increased interest rates rapidly to try to tame inflation running at 40-year highs, that would give policymakers scope to switch to cutting rates to stimulate economic growth.

""Combined with inflation falling rapidly, the Fed would cut the federal funds rate down to 1.25% by early 2024,"" the strategists said. The rate is currently at 3.75%.

""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" they added.

Expectations of a Fed pivot could lift the S&amp;P 500 to 3,900 points — a 2.4% gain from its close Monday – by the end of 2023, according to UBS.

The bank also predicted that future rate cuts will lead to 10-year US Treasury yields slipping 155 basis points to 2.65% and the dollar slowly falling the ten most heavily-traded currencies as well as gold.

# Methodology

We will compare three growth model:

1. \-5.70% Earnings' based growth model, with not legalization projected to 2026, perpetual growth
2. Arbitrary growth rate of 5% counting in legalization in 2023, projected until 2026, perpetual growth
3. Arbitrary growth counting in legalization in 2023, projected until 2026, gradual growth of 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, with averge annual perpetual growth of 12%

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

# Evaluation Methods

In this post, **three evaluation methods are used** to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: all numbers are in thousands 

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of -5.70%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE from 2019 to 2022 of -5.70%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2022 reported Free Cash Flow and its WACC based discounted rate of 9.62% and its Growth Rate of \[*scenatio 1; scenario 2; scenario 3*\]% to determine a fair value of:

1. $0.10
2. $0.37
3. $0.77

Note: the Scenario 2 and 3 is computed by using the assumption that the company will have positive free cash flow by end of 2023 as the managment planned, we assume a FCF of 10 milion

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated in the three scenarios.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.17|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of

1. $0.45
2. $4.19
3. $6.63

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|611,402,300|

This model gives us a price tag of:

1. \-$3.22
2. $1.12
3. $4.97

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

||Fair Value|
|:-|:-|
|Scenario 1|\-0.89|
|Scenario 2|$1.89|
|Scenario 3|$4.12|
|**Average of the three scenarios**|**$1.70**|

* **Tilray Inc has a well-established IT system** that ensures efficiency in its internal and external operations.
* **Tilray Inc owns a number of intellectual property rights** that include trademarks and patents. These allow it exclusivity over its products and competitors cannot copy or reverse engineer them.
* **Tilray Inc is a brand that has been in the market for years**, and people are aware of it. This makes its brand awareness high.
* **Its products have maintained quality over the years** and are still valued by customers, who find it as good value for the amount of money that they pay.
* **Partnership**s: Strategic partnerships are established by Tilray Inc with its suppliers, dealers, retailers and other stakeholders. This allows it to leverage them if need be in the future.

## Weaknesses  

* **Research and Development**: Even though Tilray Inc is spending more than the average research and development expenditure within the industry, it is spending way less than a few players within the industry that have had a significant advantage as a result of their innovative products.
* **High Day Sales Inventory**: The time it takes for products to be purchased and sold are higher than the industry average, meaning that Tilray Inc builds up on inventory adding unnecessary costs to the business.
* **Rented Property**: A significant proportion of the property that Tilray Inc owns is rented rather than purchased. It has to pay large amounts of rent on these adding to its costs.
* **Low current ratio**: The current ratio that shows the company’s ability to meet its short term financial obligations, is lower than the industry average. This could mean that the company could have liquidity problems in the future.
* **The company has low levels of current assets compared to current liabilities**, and this can create liquidity problems for it in operations.
* **Cash flow problems**: There is a lack of proper financial planning at Tilray Inc regarding cash flows, leading to certain circumstances where there isn’t enough cash flow as required leading to unnecessary unplanned borrowing.
* **Integration**: Tilray Inc's current structure and culture have resulted in the failure of various mergers aimed at vertical integration.
* **Market Research**: Tilray Inc has not conducted market research within the market that is serves since the past 2 years. As a result, it is making decisions based on years old data, while customer needs may have evolved over time.
* **High employee turnover rates**: Tilray Inc has a higher employee turnover rate compared to competitors. This means that it has more people leaving the job, and as a result, it is spending more on training and development as employees keep leaving and joining.
* **Quality Control**: Tilray Inc has a lower budget for its quality control department than competitors. This leads to lack of consistency and the possibility of damage to quality across its various outlets.
* **Lack of legal experience** and legal department employees are not highly qualified.
* **A few products have a high market share**, while most of the products have a low market share. This reliance on a few products makes Tilray Inc vulnerable to external threats if these few products suffer for any reason.
* **The workload is a high per worker** as there are fewer workers than the actual work required. This puts workers under psychological stress and is likely to be less productive.
* **Worker morale is low due to company culture** and politics that have grown in recent years.
* **Competition and qualified employees have been leaving** the organisation in recent years, which could mean a shortage of good talent for the company in the upcoming years.
* **The decision making is highly centralized**, and decisions by teams need to be approved by certain officials. This reduces efficiency in operations by making them more time consuming. It also leads to reduced innovation.
* **The performance appraisal is not in a systematic manner**. People are often not appraised for their performance. This leads to lower work morale and lack of promotion opportunities for employees.

## Opportunities

* **Internet**: there has been an increase in the number of internet users all over the world. This means that there is an opportunity for Tilray Inc to expand their presence online; by using the internet to interact with its customers.
* **E-commerce**: There has been a new trend and a growth in sales of the e-commerce industry. This means that a lot of people are now making purchases online. Tilray Inc can earn revenue by opening online stores and making sales through these.
* **Social Media**: there has been an increase in the number of social media users worldwide. The three social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, have shown the greatest number of increase in monthly active users. Tilray Inc can use social media to promote its products, interact with customers and collect feedback from them.
* **Technological developments**: technology comes with numerous benefits among many departments. Operations can be automated to reduce costs. Technology enables better data to be collected on customers and improves on marketing efforts.
* **Population**: the population has been growing and is expected to grow at a positive rate for the upcoming years. This is beneficial for Tilray Inc as there will be an increase in the number of potential customers that it can target.
* **Green government drive**: this provides an opportunity for Tilray Inc for the sale of Tilray Inc's products to federal and state government contractors.
* **Transport Industry**: the transport industry has been flourishing in the past few years, and shows growth potential in the future. This has reduced the costs of transportation, which is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will lower its overall costs.
* **Tax policy:** the governments’ reduction in tax rate is beneficial for Tilray Inc as a lower amount would be expensed out as a tax.
* **Tourism:** growth in tourism is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will provide new potential customers that it can target in order to gain market share.
* **Skilled workers:** increase in education and training by numerous institutes has increased the amount of skilled labor available within the country. This means that if Tilray Inc is able to hire skilled labor, it would have to spend less on training and development, therefore, saving costs.
* **A number of new niche markets have opened up that are growing**. Tilray Inc can sell products in these markets and take advantage.
* **Globalisation**: Increased globalisation does not restrict Tilray Inc to its own country. It can extend its operations to other countries, entering into these markets and making use of the opportunities that lie in these markets.

* **Suppliers:** The bargaining power of suppliers has increased over the years with the decrease in the number of suppliers. This means that the costs of inputs could increase for Tilray Inc.
* **New entrants:** there have been numerous players that have entered the market and are gaining market share by gaining existing companies’ market share. This is a threat to Tilray Inc as it can lose its customers to these new entrants.
* **Increasing competition**: there has been an increase in competition within the industry putting downward pressure on prices. This could lead to reduced revenue for Tilray Inc if it adjusts to the price changes, or loss of market share if it doesn’t.
* **Exchange Rate:** the exchange rate keeps fluctuating and this affects a company like Tilray Inc that has sales internationally, while its suppliers are local.
* **Political uncertainties** in the country prove to be a barrier in business, hindering performance at times and making the business incur unnecessary costs.
* **The fluctuating interest rates** in the country do not provide a stable financial and economic environment. 
* **Consumer tastes are changing**, and this puts pressure on companies to constantly change their products to meet the needs of these customers.
* **Substitute products available are also increasing**, which is threat collectively for the whole industry as consumption of current products decrease.
* **The rise in prices of fuel** has increased in the input costs for Tilray Inc. These costs have also increased as other industries that provide inputs for this company also have suffered from increasing fuel prices, thereby charging more.
* **Increased promotions by competitors** have been a threat for Tilray Inc. On most media, there is more clutter than ever, and customers are bombarded with multiple messages. This reduces the effectiveness of promotional messages by Tilray Inc.
* **Constant technological developments require the workforce to be trained** accordingly as the inability to keep up with these changes can lead to loss of business for Tilray Inc.

# Final Considerations

**What is its future potentia?**

Without Legalization, the company is destined to fail. It is burning its cash at a 2.09 rate, leavimg it only 25 months of life expectancy (take in minf that this is an assumption cause obviously in those 25 months the company will have sales and other operations bringing in cash, the life expectancy is calculated on the assumption the company will not have further sales or other income of cash, so take this data as indicative).  If we assume a recover of macro data, consumption shall growth in other segments in which the company operates, cause marijuana is not its biggest nor main revenue stream. The company is well diversified of even without legalisation we shall expect to see it aroun in the next 5 years.

With Legalizaion, it is moon time baby. Its fundamentas, at the most conservative assumptions, prices it around 4$ but we all know that hype will push it further that price level bring it to be overvalued. Retailers and institution will surely try to cash in the hype so beware of speculative plays.

With the legalization scenarios, we can expect two outcomes:

1. The Management do not manage to contain costs and improve efficiency, making it growth slow
2. The Management manages to cut cost and boost efficiency, making Tilray grow

There is potential, but risk is very high

**What are the risks?**

Observing statistical data about Tilray's price movements, we can except a 7.72% risk rate. The Stock's return distribution is concentrated around negative numbers. If you want to invest for long time expect a miminum retuern rate of 0.12% and a 44% chancge of getting a daily price movement between -4% and 0%

**Is the company a Buy or a Sell?**

This is hard. It all depend on legalization in the USA, and if it happens, it depends on when it happens. If legalization comes in 5 years, welp, this company is going tits up, but if it come next week, well, you know the drill.

Personally this stock is a Gamble, cause its fate is determined heavily by politics.

Are you a Gamblerer?

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds — high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them — have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

These divisions will be: Cannabis, Branding and a 3rd to be named later (this division is being created from within). Our plan provides for each of these divisions to be generating revenue by the end of December 2023.

We estimate that we will file the Super 8-K and financial statements within days after receiving the audit for Consolidated Apparel, Inc (""Consolidated""), which is currently producing about $1.2 million in annual revenues and will remove the Company's Shell designation and add revenue to our books. Consolidated has identified several acquisition targets that complement the Consolidated operations, which if assimilated will potentially increase annual revenues. These transactions, if completed will be structured as Asset Purchases to expedite closings.

In July of 2022, the Company issued 598,800 shares of Series B Preferred for 49.9% of GCTR Management, LLC (""GCTR""), a management company in the cannabis sector in California with two clients. GCTR currently grosses revenues of approximately $300,000 per month. We have an option to purchase the remaining 50.1% percent but will look to extend that date until the end of 2023, so we can pursue other opportunities to increase our presence in the cannabis sector in California. We will continually seek new acquisitions to potentially increase our revenues and will look to lock down 49.9% of two other entities with options to acquire the remaining portion by the end of 2023.

We have agreed to work on new projects with our partners in California with each side owning 50%.

Our new division is being set up from within services of a sector our management has decades of experience in, which we are planning to roll out during the 4th quarter of 2022.

Additionally, in the 4th quarter, we plan to begin setting up operations in the Caribbean to expand both our Branding and Cannabis divisions. For our Branding division, we plan to manufacture products on the island to be sold on the island and export products back to the United States. For Cannabis, we plan to acquire the real estate and equipment needed to operate a manufacturing operation. We will not be involved in the day-to-day operations, but plan to receive a monthly fee for the building and use of the equipment equal to 25% of the monthly revenue.

The Company, in compliance with SEC regulations, will use social media outlets like Facebook or Twitter and its own website at [www.igpk.org](http://www.igpk.org/) to announce key information in compliance with Regulation FD.

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me. 

 :Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop. 

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms. 

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized 

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization 

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again. 

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1) U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets. 

2) A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back. 

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most. 

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up. 

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well.

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 17 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

* Amazon’s stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week’s disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts’ estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It’s the first time Amazon’s market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.  


For example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.

So then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for ""airbnb"" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.

But then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!

So then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in. 

https://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739

Once I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to ""pick up"" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.

Airbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to ""look into it"". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow AM.

WHY has Facebook/META thrown nearly 100 billion at this? (with a revenue of 27 billion per quarter, they have the money)

Facebook is the ONLY multi-modal social media company in the USA. It has a marketplace, local community groups, videos (50% of all facebook traffic is watching videos) not to mention Insta, whatsapp. You can do almost anything on it. Run a business. Chat with your mom. See what your friends are doing. Rent a boat. Harass women with pics of your extremely small penis. Whatever you want! (don't do the last one bro. Just don't.)

So WHY? 

It's a hardware platform, that you cannot access on a normal PC. Only on a META VR headset (potentially) 

You think the graphics look bad? That's like blaming youtube for 480p video. Don't blame youtube. Blame the creator for having a shitty camera. Metaverse is the platform. Not the video. It's a new platform that has tools to do whatever you want. AR or VR both in one.

Now just imagine this, if you can. Tell your wife to hop off her boyfriend's dick, pull both of them over, and try to imagine with me. 

Your favorite youtube/twitch livestreamer? Don't watch them anymore. VR with them. Walk in their room as they talk to you. Sit at their desk. You're not behind a screen anymore. You're in the room. Even a prerecorded youtube video can work this way. Or do it live.

You want to see that Ye redemption concert tour but the tickets are $5,000? Attend in VR. Walk around, live. The performer doesn't need a headset. Just you. Interact with other VR people at the concert (or not). See their facial expressions. Dance with them. Switch your headset over to AR, go to the fridge, get a drink, check your texts, reply to an email, and then head back into the concert. All using the headset. Buy merch at the shop, which has an AR eshop overlay. Easy. This can be done with 3d camera arrays. Even a basic iphone can LIDAR scan a bedroom in 5 minutes. Apple ahead of the game as always. A highly accurate (to the 1/16"" accuracy) venue model can be recreated in a single day using current technology, like the Leica BLK360 scanner. That's your metaverse. It's whatever you want. 

You can't attend your best friends wedding? Attend in VR metaverse platform. The normal attendees will just see you on a screen (or not at all), they don't need headsets. But you can walk around, see the moment, while not being too invasive. To them, you're just on an ipad somewhere. Maybe there's a few 360 cameras around. Some LIDAR scanners to record the venue (or the venue provides this). You're not intrusive, but you can experience it.

56,1666981669,yfwrlh,1,"I keep hearing the argument that Apple will be displaced because Nokia and Blackberry were.
That they haven’t innovated since Jobs.

I still think the stock is a great buy and they will continue to dominate.

Anyone who compares Apple to Nokia or Blackberry are foolish. 

It was extremely simple to go from Blackberry to Apple. It’s not easy for someone to exit Apple’s ecosystem.

Apple has a “walled garden” approach to their ecosystem. Easy and fun to enter … hard and impractical to exit.

Blackberry and Nokia didn’t have the same reasons to hook people onto their phones and platform for life. 

They made only phones. Apple surrounds your life with as many products as possible all seemingly working with each other.

If you want to switch it’d be time consuming and annoying. 

You’d have to figure out how to take all your years of photos from one device to another.

It’s got over ten years of my health info.
Tons of apps I’ve paid for and use daily that I’d have to rebuy and resetup on a new platform. Some of those apps don’t have a real alternative I like on android.

If I bought movies or tv shows on iTunes I’d lose access to them on any new platform. Or I have Apple services like Apple Card and Apple Wallet that wouldn’t transfer. 

I’ve got airpods that work solely with my apple products. Not to mention my Mac, Apple TV, Watch and iPad. They all work together. It’d be huge investment switching. Who can afford it.

No other platform is as seamlessly integrated and “walled off”. It was a risky idea for a
Apple to attempt it. Probably why no one else had tried it. After all it in some ways prevents people from adopting your product when you don’t play nice with other platforms. But, now that they pulled it off it’s perfect.

Is it possible for me to change? … sure but it’d be a pain (time wise) and costlier than just upgrading my iPhone.

If a revolutionary product comes out… iPhone users are patient enough for Apple to come out with their on spin on it. That’s what’s happened so far. Android gets a great new feature and sometimes it takes awhile but iPhone gets something similar.

People have sunken too much investment in terms of time(learning the ins and outs of it) and money into Apple products and services. They probably don’t want to start from scratch in a different ecosystem.

Apple has been milking that for years.

There’s always the chance I guess that some company tries to automate the process of switching by giving out free products and services… automating everything in terms of switching. Giving a customer something amazing to switch.

But, I don’t think it’s feasible. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have tried and failed to crack the nut of competing with the iPhone. It’d be way too costly.

If anyone could… maybe Tesla. But, no one is displacing Apple like they did to Blackberry.

Maybe I’m wrong

I don't normally write here, I don't care about the stock movement either way, but had to correct a few things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Point 1: Metaverse is still minor investment 

Meta is in the name, but that was to include the family of apps as equals - you don't think Alphabet is only going to teach kids the letters on Mr. Rogers. Get it together - 80% of cash is spent on the core business. 

The core business is displaying ads. The $30B capex investment is for just that purpose - showing higher converting ads.   


Point 2: Meta doesn't want to be cool

Meta is built for people who shop at Walmart and your grandma. The same way we waste our time on this site, every demographic has a platform, and the vast majority of those demographics use a Family of Apps product.

TikTok, Youtube, Twitter (with Elon) are going to be cooler. However, facebook/insta are replacing shit, not your trip to an underground Wes Anderson inspired photo exhibit in LA. 

&amp;#x200B;

Point 3: Headsets aren't for your porn 

Don't trade this stock thinking about how you'd use the headsets today. Today they are just for novelty gaming. Like early PCs, a few specific business use cases and a couple trivial games for nerds. Most tech starts with nerds and then in 5 year, or \*more\*, when your goth gf has a lifelike avatar in the metaverse you'll buy a headset to see her when your wife is away.

Investors in Meta stock wanted to hear one thing on the embattled company's earnings call late Wednesday: an acknowledgement by founder Mark Zuckerberg that leaner spending times were ahead as margins have been squeezed by an ill-timed metaverse build out and a slowing ad market.

They heard the opposite.

The social media platform outlined about 13% year-over-year expense growth for fiscal year 2023, well above the Street's forecast of 7%. Meta will clearly continue to spend aggressively — despite the prospects of a 2023 U.S. recession — on Instagram, the metaverse, and VR hardware.

""With a new CFO in place, some may argue the company is being overly conservative,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black wrote in a note to clients, ""and while Meta typically lowers \[operating expenditure\] guidance throughout the year (as they did so far year to date), the elevated expense outlook is the wrong number at the wrong time for investors. Perhaps just as importantly, growing Reality Labs (RL) expenses appear to be one source of the elevated expense guide as RL operating losses are expected to grow significantly year over year in 2023.""

Meta shares crashed more than 20% in pre-market trading on Thursday. The ticker was atop the ""[Top Trending](https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers)"" section on the Yahoo Finance platform.

Facebook parent Meta reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

**Earnings per share (EPS): $1.64 vs $1.89 expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Revenue: $27.71 billion vs. $27.38 billion expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Daily Active Users (DAUs): 1.98 billion vs 1.98 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Monthly Active Users (MAUs): 2.96 billion vs 2.94 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Average Revenue per User (ARPU): $9.41 vs. $9.83 expected, according to StreetAccount**

Facebook’s parent is contending with a broad slowdown in online ad spending, challenges from Apple’s

 iOS privacy update and increased competition from TikTok. Add it up, and Meta is expected to post its third straight quarter of declining sales for the year.

The company said revenue for the fourth quarter will be $30 billion to $32.5 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $32.2 billion.

Meta’s revenue declined 4% year over year to $27.7 billion in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the company’s costs and expenses rose 19% year over year to $22.1 billion. Operating income declined 46% from the previous year to $5.66 billion.

The Facebook parent’s operating margin, or the profits left after accounting for costs to run the business, sank to 20% from 36% a year earlier.

Revenue in the Reality Labs unit, which houses the company’s virtual reality headsets and its futuristic metaverse business, fell by almost half from a year earlier to $285 million. Its loss widened to $3.67 billion from $2.63 in the same quarter last year.

Reality Labs has lost $9.4 billion so far this year.

Meta said that it is “holding some teams flat in terms of headcount, shrinking others and investing headcount growth only in our highest priorities.”

“As a result, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 will be approximately in-line with third quarter 2022 levels,” the company added in a statement.

* The former Facebook executive and CEO of Social Capital has helped several companies go public via SPAC, including Virgin Galactic.
* Still, Palihapitiya pushed back on the idea that SPACs were hit harder than other assets.

Billionaire investor and so-called SPAC King Chamath Palihapitiya said the zero interest rates the Federal Reserve allowed to persist for years created the “perverted” market conditions he benefited from at the height of the pandemic.

Speaking with Axios’ Dan Primack at an event on Wednesday, Palihapitiya explained what he felt contributed to the rapid rise and collapse of the SPAC market, the shorthand for special purpose acquisition companies, which created a way for young companies to go public without some of the usual IPO hurdles. SPACs, which grew in popularity in the first two years of the pandemic, have seen a reset amid economic and regulatory headwinds. Still, there are more than 450 deals on the market for a merger target ahead of 2023 deadlines, according to SPAC Research.

The former Facebook executive and CEO of Social Capital has helped several companies go public via SPAC, including Virgin Galactic

, from which he later sold his personal stake before stepping down from the board. Earlier this month he closed two SPACs after failing to find merger targets in time.

“We are learning what went wrong, which is that we had a decade-plus of zero interest rates,” Palihapitiya said of the market. “That is what fundamentally was wrong. It perverted the market. It distorted reality. It allowed manias and asset bubbles to build in every single part of the economy.”

Low interest rates mean lower returns on savings accounts, which can encourage more spending in the economy, which can be a boon for high-growth assets.

Palihapitiya said the “free money” given by the central bank resulted in a “misallocation of risk,” which led many people to misprice the risk of their investments.

The disappearing stock price for Snap continues after another challenging quarter.

Shares of the social media platform crashed 25% in pre-market trading on Friday as third quarter sales marked the fifth straight quarterly deceleration. Profits were also lackluster as Snap continued to blame an advertising slowdown and Apple privacy changes for the execution missteps.

Here's a snapshot of Snap's dismal numbers:

* **Net Sales:** $1.13 billion vs. $1.14 billion estimate
* **Daily Active Users:** 363 million vs. 358 million estimate
* **Average Revenue Per User:** $3.11 vs. $3.17 estimate
* **Adjusted EPS:** $0.08 vs. estimated loss of $0.02
* **Guidance:** ""Flat"" revenue growth seen in the fourth quarter

The company warned sales trends in the fourth quarter would get worse.

Snap shares were tops on the Yahoo Finance '[Trending Ticker](https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers)' page through early morning.

EvercoreISI analyst [Mark Mahaney](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-is-a-broken-growth-story-top-tech-analyst-174325345.html) said Snap's Q3 results negatively surprised them. ""We had assumed that the August improvement Snap disclosed in early September would hold for the quarter. Instead, Snap's revenue trends were a very volatile 0% year over year in July, mid-teens % growth year over year in August, and low single-digit % growth year over year in September…even with comps easing from the Platform Policy Changes, which began in early Q3:21,"" he said.

""And we think it likely that the recent major personnel changes at SNAP – the loss of key ad execs to Netflix – has exacerbated the headwinds,"" Mahaney added.

 Analyst spotlight

Jefferies analyst [Brent Thill](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/facebook-move-metaverse-optical-illusion-143959906.html) sees three problems with the stock. He's sticking with a Buy rating on Snap in the wake of the disastrous third quarter. But the long-time tech analyst sees three problems ahead that may still not be priced into Snap's deeply discounted stock price:

* *""Q4 rev guidance implies significant growth deceleration. While Snap has seen its revenue growth accelerate to +9% year over year quarter to date, management is still only forecasting flat year over year growth for Q4. Weakness in brand advertising appears to be the main source of the steep deceleration, but we think there could also be conservatism embedded. In our view, Q1'23 may be the bottom for revenue growth, with gradual acceleration through 2023 on easing comparisons.*
* *It's difficult to parse out how many of Snap's issues are transitory. The weakening macro backdrop is partially to blame for soft results, but we question how much is due to the iOS privacy issues and competitive threats. We view the competitive threats as most concerning given the potential long-term implications for the platform.*
* *20% headcount reductions and executive departures could cause further disruptions. We worry that Snap's reorganization could lead advertisers to slow or even pause their spending. Given Snap had been growing headcount over 30% year over year for 4 straight quarters, we wonder if the company can execute on its lofty growth objectives with a 20% smaller employee base.""*

90,1665754993,y3uc7v,1,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg failed to anticipate a newer trend in social networking that contributed to the success of rival TikTok.

&amp;#x200B;

In an interview published Wednesday in analyst Ben Thompson’s Statechery newsletter, the Facebook founder said he “sort of missed” a newer way that people “interact with discovered content” via social networking services. People are increasingly using their social networking “feeds” to discover compelling content as opposed to viewing the media shared by the friends that they follow, he explained.

&amp;#x200B;

Although people still interact with content that their friends share in their feeds, the overall social networking trend has “by and large shifted to you use your feed to discover content, you find things that are interesting, you send them to your friends in messages and you interact there,” Zuckerberg said.

&amp;#x200B;

“So in that world, it is actually somewhat less important who produces the content that you’re finding, you just want the best content,” the Facebook founder said. (Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta last year.)

&amp;#x200B;

Analysts have attributed TikTok’s rapid rise in popularity to its algorithm, which can recommend compelling short videos to users based on their habits and viewing history. TikTok’s rise has posed a significant challenge to the company, which is experiencing a decline in North American Facebook users, and a stock price that’s lost more than 56% this year so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Zuckerberg referred to TikTok as a “very effective competitor” during the interview and acknowledged that the company was ″somewhat slow to this because it didn’t fit my pattern of a social thing, it felt more like a shorter version of YouTube to me,” he said.",Admitting a mistake doesn't mean the stock will go up: Mark Zuckerberg says he missed a huge shift in the social network,1.0,2022-10-14 13:43:13

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in [a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653?mod=article_inline)from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN).com Inc., [Meta Platforms](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META) Inc.’s Facebook, [Alphabet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG) Inc.’s Google, [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) Corp. and [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) Corp.

Key Excerpt:

AMONG THE JOURNAL’S FINDINGS:   

* While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon. com Inc. 
* More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.
* More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.
* At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies. 
* About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.  
* When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency’s work.",WSJ: Government Officials Invest in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,1.0,2022-10-11 15:15:18

A brand is a way of conveying who we are and what we represent. For many years, a good brand strategy has been the foundation from which you build more meaningful connections with customers. It is important for us, our employees, or any business partner to understand how we can have such a powerful impact. The brand strategy is one of the most crucial parts of marketing to get right, as people are becoming smarter about their buying choices. And brands are still at the heart of all that, whether they're small businesses looking for growth capital or large corporations seeking new ways to compete on a global level.

How do I do my branding?

To figure this out, consider the various approaches companies take in figuring out who they will be and what they want to say. We may think our products should appeal to individuals, but there's more than one way we can tell people we're here. There are so many things we can take into account: our values, beliefs, our approach to life and everything else we can do to make ourselves known. As long as you know how to talk to the audience, you can start telling them what you do. What's important to remember is that a great brand strategy starts by understanding yourself—that is, where you make yourself known—and finding your voice. You have to find ways to give your company personality as well. When we see someone looking out the window at dusk walking down an avenue, it helps us identify with them. Similarly, if you look around a room and spot several books on different continents, you can easily pick up the vibe that person is looking for. The brand is just defined as being what you want the public to believe you are, so when you see these two examples, you can draw upon your own personal history to define who you are. However, when you understand what a company represents, then we can really give our thoughts about why you should have them.

How does social media fit into your overall brand strategy?

Social media isn’t just something to post pictures of. Social media has actually become one of the strongest points of differentiation for most companies. Whether you're trying to reach a specific part of your target market or just want to try to stay relevant, social is often what helps you do it in a particular area. One example is Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.. and everything is constantly changing thanks to the innovations around technology, platforms like WhatsApp, Viber, Messenger and others. But all social media can also lead you to other places on the internet, so it doesn’t hurt to keep tabs on how it is evolving. You need to do all you can as a brand to maintain its relevance.

It is also important to keep in mind what kind of content you're posting. Think carefully about what you want your audience to see and how you want them to engage with your brand. This means having a social media team behind you, which you'll run through every day to update your followers and share relevant content. Then, they should take your posts and use them to promote themselves. Posting engaging videos and content related to your brand, such as newsletters, product descriptions, interviews, etc., is vital to building your brand image.

It doesn't matter if your company is just beginning, just having a solid digital presence is an excellent strategy. If you’re a local business struggling to grow, then that might mean launching an influencer marketing campaign. Nowadays, those strategies are not only effective but also very affordable. In fact, some small businesses use influencer marketing because they are easy to set up—you don't have to hire professionals or spend time on researching the competition. So many small businesses choose influencer agencies to help them build their networks and grow organically over time. Plus, you don't need to pay anyone to advertise your product. And finally, if you choose influencer campaigns, they charge less money per post—as compared to using traditional tactics.

What role can AI play in strategic branding?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere nowadays, and it’s one of the biggest topics that top tech companies are addressing. From helping you to analyze data to predicting future trends, to helping to discover new products based on previous purchases and buying patterns. They provide a lot of data which companies can use to innovate, improve their performance, and even gain a competitive edge. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning are essential for creating a strong customer experience by analyzing past feedback and trends. All of these are extremely useful since it will allow companies to better understand their audiences. This allows companies to serve their customers better, which improves their loyalty and trust.

How much automation do I need?

A lot of people don’t understand the importance of adding automation to their routine. Some believe that if nothing else, robots will eventually replace human jobs. To answer their fears, robots will need to perform a huge number of tasks and will have more attention than humans. Human tasks aren’t perfect—they’ll still make mistakes. Many employers believe that automating mundane tasks makes people more efficient. Automation keeps everyone busy without performing any manual labor. Here are three reasons why automating the boring stuff matters so much:

It saves time:: An employee can work fewer hours without spending time replying to emails and meetings. Companies who automate their processes save time but don’t pay extra for doing it, while the ones that rely on manual labor always regret this decision. So, automating will save time.

It gets more done: In addition, it prevents errors and ensures security. With AI-driven tools and techniques, you can reduce human error and ensure that your data is secure. Since you won’t need your workers to check data manually, they’ll be able to focus on higher-value tasks. Also, automation means your workforce doesn't need to hire additional people. Instead, they can choose among existing staff and start working on key projects such as investing in research, improving the service, optimizing sales, increasing productivity, or designing new products.

How do you build a loyal community to build your brand strategy?

When you learn how to build a successful brand strategy, first of all, you need to understand what kinds of communities you need to have. Do you want to have smaller groups or larger communities? Which type of users would you want to attract? And how will you connect with them? These questions will guide you to the best ways to do so. Secondly, you need to ask yourself what makes users feel welcomed. Does anyone ever leave your site feeling bad after interacting with you? How often do they come back and do anything else they haven’t completed in the last few minutes of viewing?

The third thing to consider is the value you have for your visitors. Would you go to a website with no information about your services, products, prices, or offers? Or are you going to offer high-quality services and a pleasant user experience? No matter your message, tone, or industry, your brand will stand out in front of your competitors, if you have clear communication channels and a cohesive brand strategy. You should know what type of messaging works and the right way to interact with your audience.

A brand should never stop being relevant. Keep a check on your strategy so that you can continuously evolve and stay on top. It takes a certain level of maturity or self-awareness to have such control, but if you take the time to understand who you are and how you can help people, it takes just a little effort and you’ll realize that you're not alone in your journey. Your brand is what sets your foot on the ground and gives your audience what they need. That’s when they become hooked. So make sure you stay on top of it.

Given the company’s future prospects, future profitability estimates, and the current price of risk, I estimated the intrinsic value of Facebook at $420b or $156 per share, with a 1-year price target at $171 per share, implying a 23% upside.

## The Metaverse is Coming, Later

Meta made a possibly rushed bet on the metaverse while getting slightly carried away in its peer campaign to offset public and regular attention from their business practices.

Staking the company on a big promise such as the metaverse isn’t a bad tactic to “get it done”, but it will likely require more time and effort than anyone has initially estimated. This strategy is in contrast to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL)’s approach where they have a diverse product portfolio, but end up discontinuing projects as no key executive has the steel to stake their reputation on them.

### Reinvesting Into the Business

Meta estimated a CapEx spend of [around $32b](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Meta-06.30.2022-Exhibit-99.1-Final.pdf) in 2022, but seems to be quietly trimming spending on headcount and likely internally freezing projects. In the future, I expect Meta to lower the focus on the metaverse project, and move to improving key advertising features of its platform (\*cough\* that buggy mess), providing new content creation features, and incentives for people and professionals to create content.

### More or Better Content

As a maturing tech business, I believe that the company will have to reinvest more into existing features to make them fun (not engaging), and profitable for people.

Regarding content creation, I imagine the business will engage in something like the following projects:

* Hybrid-AI programs - content created by [AI](https://beta.openai.com/), but enriched by a content creator.
* AI program - short AI created content snips.
* Engaging in contractor services - reinvesting in strategic content creation, such as high search volume content, content for groups and assistance, etc.

## Valuation

I expect a slowdown of revenue growth in the coming year with a growth of 2% in 2023 and 7% in the 4 years thereafter, with a decay function converging to the riskfree rate at year 10.

As a maturing company, I expect Meta to start slightly declining in profitability and allocating more resources to improving the quality of existing features, this may result in a future adjusted EBIT margin of 28% down from the adj. EBIT margin of 47.5% in the last 12 months. I adjust EBIT by capitalizing R&amp;D, as this is a key investment for a tech company like Meta. The cost of capital used at the start of the valuation is 9.75%.

[Finally, here is the resulting model for Meta:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660)

Here is the table if you want to dig into the details:

[NASDAQ:META Valuation Table, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/i88xxjzh5ds91.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1119f6a004da3815047985cd408a50297b4b489b)

You can use this general model to fine-tune your view of the company’s future, as well as an explainer of why the market price has dropped for Facebook.

### Risks

Meta’s key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. YouTube may become more engaging with its “shorts” feature, and the platform is set up to produce more costly content via its revenue sharing program with creators. This is opposed to Meta, which produces “cheaper” content that can only be monetized by advertisers and influencers, while people have little incentive to be creative on the platform. This may slowly shift the platform to a low-value content aggregator. *Think about it, which of your favorite figures are on Meta, and how many are there exclusively?*

Meta’s decision-making hierarchy seems to be structured top-down. While this allows for efficient execution of projects, the trade-off is that the administration is deaf to consumer feedback.

The metaverse project may be a large cash drain for investors, and nobody has the power to say “no” to the voting rights of the CEO. The best investors can do is leave - like Peter Theil, and that is a weak feedback mechanism which is starting to show its downside.

## Conclusion

The market seems to be pricing the company at or even slightly below intrinsic value.

Meta will have a rough period ahead, but can create additional value if it balances the business between focusing on internal quality and returning capital to investors.

* Check out the competitor dashboard, that tells you where Meta ranks amongst key peers. You can also find your next research candidates there. I would move to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL) next, as a higher quality stock.
* If you are thinking of Meta in terms of trading, try the market sentiment analysis. This can help you better assess the short-term market disposition towards the stock.
* Intrinsic analysis isn’t always the best option, so try comparing it with the multiple analysis in the sheet. Pay attention to the implied EV/Sales ratio, which is based on a regression model that tries to find out if the market is underpricing the stock. It has its flaws, but it may help.
* Take a look at the decision tree at the bottom. It runs a few checks to see which strategies are appropriate for the stock.","Not Great, Not Terrible: Why I Valued Meta at $420 Billion",1.0,2022-10-07 10:54:02

1)  First of all, it most likely will no longer be a publicly traded company and will become a private company. This will be a major change for the social media giant as private status reduces regulation requirements, increases flexibility, limits liability and allows for faster decisions-making, etc.

2)  I wouldn’t be surprised if the name Twitter changed similar to what Facebook did.

3)  Musk might allow controversial individuals to return or he might kick more people off the site, only time will tell.

4)  Musk could even shut it down for an extended period of time as he revamps its’ path forward.

Below is my rationale behind these companies and my decision to purchase their stocks exclusively and heavily these next 15 months, please let me know your thoughts!

-Diversification from USD. These companies are renown worldwide and bring in 65% of their revenue, give or take, from other currencies - a possible windfall in the future.

-Google has 125 billion dollars in cash. This is about 10% of their market capitalization &amp; they’re planning on conducting substantial share buybacks now and next year, and possibly buying Pinterest.

-If you type in ‘how sheryl sandberg changed the digital advertising business’ on google images you will see a graph that shows the global ad spend by mediums and companies, it is astonishing. Meta and Google are also known to be extremely profitable companies.

-Looking at 2021 free cash flow of Meta - 39.3b, and their market cap presently - 372.5b, they produce approximately 10.6% of their market cap in free cash flow. Say in 5-10 years, buying the shares at this valuation, and if the metaverse is a complete dud and they abandon associated capital expenditures, I reckon they will be able to afford a 15% dividend from today’s value.

-The digital advertising market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 17.6% from 2021-2026.

-Their valuations are extremely appealing.

-They are not associated with China, so potential future conflicts will be less impactful.

119,1664547030,xs2cwk,1,"Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it will freeze hiring and restructure some teams in an effort to cut costs and shift priorities.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced the social networking company’s freeze during a weekly Q&amp;A session with employees, according to a person in attendance. He added that the company would reduce budgets across most teams, even teams that are growing, and that individual teams will sort out how to handle headcount changes—whether that means not filling roles that employees depart, shifting people to other teams, or working to “manage out people who aren’t succeeding,” according to remarks reviewed by Bloomberg.

“I had hoped the economy would have more clearly stabilized by now, but from what we’re seeing it doesn’t yet seem like it has, so we want to plan somewhat conservatively,” Zuckerberg said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta’s further cost cuts and hiring freeze are its starkest admission that advertising revenue growth is slowing, amid mounting competition for users’ attention. Meta said earlier this year that it was planning to slow hiring for some management roles, and had postponed handing out full-time jobs to summer interns. The freeze was necessary because “we want to make sure we’re not adding people to teams where we don’t expect to have roles next year,” Zuckerberg explained.

Zuckerberg had warned in July that that Meta would “steadily reduce headcount growth,” and that “many teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas.” Priorities internally include Reels, Meta’s TikTok competitor, and Zuckerberg’s futuristic plan for the internet, known as the metaverse. Meta had more than 83,500 employees as of June 30, and added 5,700 new hires in the second quarter. Zuckerberg said the company would be “somewhat smaller” by the end of 2023.

“For the first 18 years of the company, we basically grew quickly basically every year, and then more recently our revenue has been flat to slightly down for the first time,” he told staff Thursday.

During its first-quarter earnings call, the company said annual expenses would be roughly $3 billion lower than initially projected, trimming an estimated range that had been as high as $95 billion. In prior moves to reduce spending, a dual-camera watch the company was building to compete with the Apple Watch was shuttered.

Russell Brand with 5.9 million followers has signed a deal for an exclusive live show on the platform.

Glen Greenwald the founder of The Intercept and a Pulitzer-Prize-winning investigative journalist who leaked the Snowden files is also starting an exclusive live TV news show.

Impressive Growth Story:

On par with Twitter in million monthly active users last reported @ 69 million and that company is presently valued at around $44bn, in comparison Rumble is currently deeply discounted at a value of only $2bn-$3bn.

## Growth Story:

(**Excerpt from CEO on SEC filing**) Before this explosion of growth, we were doing roughly 1, 1.5 million monthly active users. In our first major leg of growth, we posted 21 million monthly active users in Q4 of 2020. By the summer, of Q3 of 2021, Rumble hit another leg of growth, hitting an average of 36 million monthly active users on the platform.

Rumble saw another massive leg of growth happen, averaging an average of 44 million monthly active users in Q2 of 2022. Then that takes us to now, and what we’ve seen now is probably one of the most exciting times that I’ve ever seen in running this business. We are now transcending politics. This has nothing to do with politics anymore. We hit 78 million monthly active users globally in August of 2022, with 63 million alone in just US and Canada.

# What makes them different:

Censorship has become a major problem on the YouTube platform for content providers and they are starting to take notice. I believe it’s about to reach a tipping point on its way to juggernaut status. Mainstream media and tech companies continue to ignore alternate viewpoints or actively try to suppress information.

Information suppression is likely to get worse after the midterm elections go badly for the democrats, with platforms likely to double down on their idea censorship. Rumble is a bootstrapped company whose main tenet is to resist censorship which will eventually cause a shift in the most popular names to move platforms to regain their freedom.

## Notable Investors:

May 19, 2021 - Peter Thiel and venture capital firm, Narya Capital, which was co-founded by author J.D. Vance. Narya’s Ethan Fallang will be joining Rumble’s board of directors.

Peter Thiel isn’t in the habit of losing money!

David Sacks - another member of the famed Paypal mafia was recently complaining that an episode of his popular podcast had been removed from YouTube without explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

## Nimble and actively recruiting

After Truth Social went live in February with a rocky start users couldn’t sign up because of glitches Rumble stepped in and migrated the platform to its cloud infrastructure in April.

It's planning on offering its cloud web hosting service with guarantees to uphold freedom of speech and plans to make it available to all users in 2023. [According to Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/), the $178 billion cloud services market, which grew by 37% in 2021, is dominated by the tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Google who all have questionable records on censorship.

The company is also quick to react to calls for content creators' cancelations one recent example is Joe Rogan’s who the media called to cancel before any decisions were made Rumble quickly stepped in with a $100 million contract offer.

# Conclusion

Take this lesson from the past as to why you should support free speech platforms even if you are not currently in need or personally affected:

*First, they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.*

*Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.*

*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.*

*Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.*

This has all the hallmarks of the [Digg Exodus of 2010](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=reddit,digg) where a platform ignored the needs of its users and they quickly moved on to the site you are reading this on today!

130,1663169348,xe4whv,1,"U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been oft-critical of social media companies, said he wants to regulate and maybe license the companies, including big names like Meta’s Facebook or Twitter, Reuters wrote.

Graham said he’s working on a measure with Sens. Elizabeth Warren  and Josh Hawley. 

Graham, speaking at a hearing to discuss security lapses at Twitter, said companies had been able to become “internationally powerful” without much restrictions on what they were allowed to do.

He also said he had concerns that there were few tools the Federal Trade Commission could use to rein them in — he said they’re not licensed and “you can’t sue them.” He added that “if you drive a car, you need a license, if you sell real estate, you need a license.”

The plan he has might involve regulations with limits on what speech the companies could take down and regulating them to be tougher about criminal use of the networks and foreign interference.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have critiqued the big tech companies, with some of the concerns being antitrust and the lack of oversight.

Criticism of big tech is nothing new and isn’t restricted to Congress. Recently, more than a dozen tech companies offering alternatives to the big tech firms have come out in favor of more regulation against the big tech companies.

“Massive tech platforms can exert influence over society and the digital economy because they ultimately have the power to collect, analyze, and monetize exorbitant amounts of personal information,” the companies, and others, wrote in a letter to Congress together. “This is not by accident, as some of the tech giants have intentionally abused their gatekeeper positions to lock users into perpetual surveillance while simultaneously making it difficult to switch to privacy-protective alternatives.”

132,1663078383,xd8o1i,1,"Mark Zuckerberg’s poor leadership skills are slowly dragging Meta toward failure, a Harvard expert says.

Zuckerberg’s shortcomings as CEO are “continuing to derail” the tech giant formerly known as Facebook, according to Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former CEO of medical technology company Medtronic.

“I think Facebook is not going to do well as long as he’s there,” George tells CNBC Make It. “He’s likely one of the reasons so many people are turning away from the company. He’s really lost his way.”

George has spent the past 20 years studying leadership failures in the workplace, recently compiling those findings into a new book called, “True North: Leading Authentically in Today’s Workplace, Emerging Leader Edition.”

In short, George says bosses that lose sight of their most deeply held beliefs, values and purpose as a leader — especially in the name of money, fame or power — are doomed to fail. And after decades of researching high-profile corporate collapses, he says he sees striking similarities to Zuckerberg and Meta today.

Zuckerberg and Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It’s request for comment. The Meta CEO is largely responsible for his company’s meteoric growth to this point, transforming the company he co-founded in 2004 into a tech giant with a $450.46 billion market cap, as of Monday morning.

In doing so, he helped create the modern-day social media industry — a move he’s attempting to replicate now by repositioning his company into the metaverse space. Given his past success, it might be unwise to bet against him, as CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on “Squawk Box” in February.

“I know that this is probably out of fashion, I have total faith in Mark Zuckerberg. I think Zuckerberg’s going to be able to pull off ... the metaverse,” Cramer said, adding that Meta has a track record of rebounding after stock dips, scandal and controversy. “There’s some people you have to bet on. And if you go back to 2018 to that horrible summer breakdown ... no one thought these guys could come back.”

Still, George says Meta is bound to fail as long as Zuckerberg remains at the helm. Here’s why:

The bonus shares for each price target need to hold for 20 days within a 30 day window (straight), to be paid out.

Rumble is experiencing MASSIVE month-month / yearly growth. (currently 78M monthly average users for the month of August)

As more and more creators look for safe haven from being YouTube banned (because of politics/science/etc), they take shelter at Rumble, the ONLY free-speech platform, that is professional and lets you speak openly (within the boundaries of the law). 

Andrew Tate was recently banned off essentially ALL media platforms, (they all banded together and cancelled him), so he joined Rumble, and expressed why Rumble is important, and that everyone needs a company like Rumble to fight against Big-tech, so people can have their own opinions without being cancelled. He has asked everyone to rally together and Join Rumble, and create accounts there.

This has opened up the doors to entirely new demographic of user starting to join, and now with hints of Stevewilldoit/Nelk/Fullsend Being next up to join, due to cancellation.

More and more creators will start cross-posting their YouTube channels to Rumble, as just another source of revenue, whether they're cancelled or not. This will in turn spike the Monthly average users and ad revenue through the roof, and open the doors to more channels being cross-posted.

The company has a host of investors behind it, the most notable is Peter Thiel. This is his first media investment since Facebook. 

Rumble will be entering the cloud service space in the next year or so, they're already expanding what they currently have. (Truth Social from TMTG) is currently running on their cloud service infrastructure, and in the next year or so Rumble will open the doors to be commercially available. They also have a payment processor that is free of big-tech, and are in talks of a web browser.

They are advertising as being the ONLY free-speech, anti-censorship media platform AND hosting infrastructure on the markets. which IMO will be MASSIVE. These niche companies will always be a standout, especially if they have non-stop rolling catalysts from big youtube creators joining the platform in the process.

Rumble is a real pillar in the free-speech sector. They're even suing Google currently for 2B+ in damages, for google routing search results to YouTube, rather then other (smaller) video platforms like Rumble. You can search for a Rumble video SPECIFICALLY on google and it will bring up a YouTube video. Which is illegally favoring their own businesses. Rumble has now entered a stage in the lawsuit where Google will have to provide how their algorithms work when searching for things, to ensure they aren't favoring their own businesses (which they clearly are).. This could be a MASSIVE discovery.

Rumble plans on taking Marketshare from:

YouTube/google, AWS, Azure, and they're releasing tiktok format videos. 

With Trump, Andrew Tate, and a host of other notable creators likely to join, all backed by a free-speech driven CEO, this just screams ""meme"" status, but with real sentimental value.

A group of Reddit-based retail investors on the Wall Street Bets page boosted shares of GameStop in 2021 in an effort to hammer short-selling hedge funds.

The ensuing meme-stock-mania resulted in sharp swings in the company’s share price, worrying Wall Street and recently impacting other retailers like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Activist investor and meme stock king Ryan Cohen is chairman of GameStop and had bought more than 10% of Bed Bath’s stock before cashing out of the troubled home-good retailer.

“Dumb Money” is based on Ben Mezrich’s nonfiction book “The Antisocial Network,” which was published in September 2021. Previous Mezrich works include “The Accidental Billionaires,” which was adapted into the Oscar-winning Facebook movie “The Social Network,” and the MIT blackjack scandal book “Bringing Down the House,” which was adapted into the Kevin Spacey movie “21.”

A rights sale for “Dumb Money” is set to kick off this month at this year’s Toronto Film Festival, according to Variety.

“Dumb Money” will be directed by Craig Gillespie, who previously collaborated with Stan on his 2017 film “I, Tonya” and the Hulu series “Pam &amp; Tommy.” Like “Dumb Money,” both of those projects focused on real-life events involving disgraced figure skating Olympian Tonya Harding, actress and model Pamela Anderson and Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee.

Filming on “Dumb Money” is set to begin this month.

I made 100 euros in a day without selling anything but only doing a job that a publisher would do before a written book is published. And I found it on Facebook in those groups for writers and authors.

Who wrote or wrote a story came to these groups to look for the so-called ""Beta readers"" that is, those who read a story and make a kind of review. I did and still do the beta reader. He usually doesn't get paid to do it.

It is something that is done voluntarily with the certainty that in the event that you write your own story, you will be returned the favor. But there are people who prefer to pay. And so there was this American lady who had written a children's story and was looking for reviews before publishing it.

I offered and we exchanged some emails and she sent me the file. I read the story and sent my review. After a couple of hours she writes to me saying that she liked my review and that she wanted me to help her improve the story, correct grammar errors and so on.

We agreed on a price which eventually came to 100 euros. She immediately paid me the money, giving me a week for delivery.

After a week I did everything and even added comments on various parts of the story. The lady was satisfied because, as she said, with the comments I wrote she was able to understand the story well.

Here's how I made 100 euros in one day. Of course it doesn't happen often but when it does, it's nice.","You are locked in a room with a computer and you have to make 100 euros in a day, how do you do it there?",1.0,2022-08-31 14:40:02

I know some of you struggle to find motivation with your loss porn.

But owning AMD will give you a reaction stronger than viagra.

AMD beat both on top and bottom lines, achieving 8 **record quarters of revenues**, hitting $6.6bn, with yearly **growth of 70%**.

As of today, both Intel and Nvidia have **MISSED** their Q2 earnings.

**Intel**: reported their **first quarterly loss since 2017**. Investors are **horrified**, as Pat's ""rearview mirror"" statement is haunting him. Their discrete GPU (ARC) is a **FAILURE**. Their Sapphire Rapids server chip for the datacenter are a no-show, while they keep losing share to EPYC.

[EVERYTHING IS DOWN... except taxes and R&amp;D expenditures](https://preview.redd.it/t3xrfh8cvtj91.jpg?width=1774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8132dee859292de04e93d2b901068b386c54a562)

**Nvidia**: just reported revenues of to $6.7bn, a  reduction of over $1bn from initial expectations. They can't get rid of their RTX 3000 over production. Next quarter guidance is $5.9 billion a HUGE drop from the $8.3bn last quarter and **LESS THAN AMD's revenue**.

[EVERYTHING DOWN... except Operating Expenses](https://preview.redd.it/c3mfoiu6wtj91.jpg?width=1704&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afae7ccda8dc43ff271f3db33ef2943518ed92dc)

**AMD PASSED NVIDIA IN SALES THIS QUARTER**

Not only AMD's revenues up by 70% thanks to the Xilinx integration, but AMD  is also entering the telecommunications and automotive industries. AMD is the ONLY semiconductor company that reiterated its 2022 guidance, while the competition is revising downwards.

[Data Center Growth of 83&amp;#37; year over year!!!](https://preview.redd.it/qjgha03mutj91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd82832d651c07aa2fa13f7ed6ee8a45f7265c0e)

**This year belongs to AMD.**

**Breaking down AMD by markets:**

**Client:**  Consumer PC's have dropped as we head into the second half of 2022. The exceptional demand created by COVID-19 is gone, as consumers have the equipment they need. AMD expects the rest of 2022 to have a mid-teen drop in sales, but still record and better than last year's.

**Gaming:**  which includes GPUs and gaming consoles, is getting hit from the GPU  side, as demand drops from mining drops and new GPUs coming out in the next 3 months (consumers hold their purchases  before new generation launches). However, expect the drop to be offset by console chips (Xbox, Playstation, Steam Deck, Aya, etc.), which have a sales spike in Q3.

**Embedded:**  Entirely comprised of Xilinx products is a door opener for AMD, as it  will increase its offering and TAM. Expect this business to continue growing at double digits.

**Datacenter:** the jewel of the crown, growing 83% year over year, is **VERY STRONG**  and continues to take market from Intel. Genoa, Genoa-X and Bergamo  Epyc chips will continue taking market from Intel. This market is bound  to become AMD's largest business next year.

SAMSUNG, TESLA, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent... all major tech companies are buying AMD chips for their products and infrastructure.

To summarize, AMD's execution has been **ROCK SOLID**.

You now have a chance to buy the stock at double digits.... CALL NOW!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**AMD's Stock Price Target: ($120 for Q3, $150 for Q4, all time high in 2023).**

**Remember:** AMD launches Zen 4 Ryzen chips next month (September), as well as its RDNA3 Radeon High-end gaming GPUs in November, and the Genoa Epyc chips in Q4.

**This is AMD's BEST YEAR in terms of product launches.**

I expect AMD to hit its all time high in 2023, likely in the first half of the year.

It is heading to the moon, leaving the competition behind. All aboard!!!

Zoom Video Communications Inc. is struggling to convince people to pay for its videoconferencing service in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a trimmed forecast and falling stock price Monday.

Zoom ZM, -2.07% executives reduced their earnings and revenue guidance for the fiscal year Monday afternoon, and Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg blamed a stronger U.S. dollar — a problem many global tech companies have called out in recent earnings reports — but also a decline in “the online business,” or the more casual Zoom user.

“Our revenue was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, performance of the online business, and to a lesser extent sales weighted to the back end of the quarter,” Steckelberg said in a statement included with the results.

In an interview with MarketWatch and a conference call Monday afternoon, Steckelberg acknowledged that individuals and small businesses have changed their habits. Many aren’t flocking to the service as often or for as long as they did during the peak of the pandemic, when many Americans were working almost exclusively from home and socializing with friends over the service. An increase in one-on-one meetups, vacations and hybrid work schedules have altered the post-pandemic business cycle for Zoom, executives acknowledge, and getting users to pay is harder.

“The big challenge is new customer additions,” she said.

Zoom recently installed a 40-minute limit on users with a Basic, or free, subscription, which Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said could be a way to push more users to become paying subscribers. Steckelberg told MarketWatch that the time cap has had a “significantly positive impact” so far, but admitted in the conference call it was “not enough to overcome the macro dynamics.”

The news wasn’t all bad — Zoom’s enterprise business, which sells subscriptions to larger organizations, grew 27% to $599 million. Enterprise customers improved 18% to 204,100 over the past year through contracts with UCLA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -7.43% and others, as well as longer deals. Zoom Phone licenses hit a record of nearly 4 million, up more than 100% year-over-year.

“It was a mixed quarter, with enterprise proving to be strong,” Steckelberg told MarketWatch.

The ongoing friction between employees who wish to continue to work from home and employers like Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.30%, Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -2.53% GOOG, -2.58% Google and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META, -2.92% — all of whom are sitting on acres of unused commercial real estate and asking workers to come in at least twice a week — could have a profound impact on Zoom. A group of Apple employees on Monday launched a petition asking CEO Tim Cook for a more flexible work policy.

The company also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.94%, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -2.03%, Google and many other corners.

M Science’s software analyst Charles Rogers believes users aren’t jumping to other platforms, but cutting the service because of inflation and more relaxed pandemic guidelines. He also saw more worrisome results internationally than in the U.S., with a second consecutive quarterly decline in the European region and sequentially flat sales in the Asia Pacific quadrant.

Zoom posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $45.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, up from $1.02 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Zoom reported earnings of $1.05 a share, down from $1.36 a share last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 94 cents a share on revenue of $1.12 billion.

Zoom executives said they now expect full-year adjusted earnings of $3.66 to $3.69 a share on revenue of roughly $4.39 billion, down from $3.70 to $3.77 a share on sales of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion. For the third quarter, they expect 82 to 83 cents a share on revenue of about $1.1 billion, while analysts on average had been projecting 92 cents a share on sales of $1.15 billion, according to FactSet.

Zoom shares declined nearly 9% in after-hours trading following release of the results, after closing with a 2.1% decline at $97.44. Zoom’s stock is down 47% so far in 2022. The broader S&amp;P 500 index  SPX, -2.14%  has slid 13% this year.","Zoom is struggling to convince consumers to pay, and the stock is sliding",1.0,2022-08-23 01:48:45

Elon Musk being the king troll may have a very interesting claim during the October lawsuit.  

His Twitter bot is created just to create crazy tweets and consists of over 10% of his Twitter community engagements.

Elon is just sitting back waiting for Twitter to produce evidence that the bots are significant below Elon’s estimates.  Either way, it is going to reveal a lot about their algorithms and potentially other social media platforms too.  This lawsuit could create potential catalysts on how investors view social media and monetization.

If this is indeed the case, Elon is going to let Twitter hang themselves by dropping the truth bomb during the trial.  Not only Twitter, the other platforms could be vulnerable for class action lawsuits.  Many digital campaigns had issues of advertising to the wrong crowd and inability to weed out misinformation ([most recent issues with Facebook here)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/facebook-misses-misinformation-in-brazilian-election-ads)

TL:DR during the Twitter vs Yi-Long Ma trial, Yi-Long is going to reveal that he wrote a Twitter bot that posted over 10% of all of his tweets.  However, this bomb will not drop until Twitter is forced to leak some major corporate secrets to the public.",Heard it here first.

&amp;#x200B;

When a stock has reached its maximum FUD is when you should be buying, not after the hype has been spread, and all the groupies jump on the ship.....

&amp;#x200B;

What we have seen is maximum FUD with many of the stocks, but one in particular, that being Blackberry. Evern on Reddit, they will not allow any upvoting to support what seems to me as a hostile take over actions of Blackberry, by who I am going to guess is Musk, as how can we know the true short position without a decentralized blockchain? As the endless selling and the manipulation from the insiders prove nothing here adds up.

When the run up came last year, why did the CEo jump out of the closet and scream - ""I have no idea why the share price has gone up""? And did he not dump a large amount of shares during this time (this I can not testify to though I am sure someone can verify this)? The next question why is he still hiding the facebook settlement? It has been 6 quarters and he is no longer collecting revenue which he was prior to the settlement, of say $50 million a quarter, and you can find anything on the quarterly reports, yet, he does wonderful in decimating the EPS. Another question, with all the partnerships and the IVY self driving software [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy) why has no revenue been declared for the 200 million vehicles it currently is installed in? And dont forget the 500 million on the backlog for installation, as we can all be aware these vehicles wont be driving themselves for free...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we review the patents the hold for cryptagraphy - [https://blackberry.certicom.com/en](https://blackberry.certicom.com/en) and the utility of blockchain security, as we can review any crypt project such IOTA with an $800 Million plus Market Cap, with no sustainable revenue or path forward, such is the greater fool theory. [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/)

&amp;#x200B;

Then of course comes the Cylance Security [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security) which has proven profitable, and now with former *McAfee* president John Giamatteo as president of its cyber security business unit, what amount of revenue will this generate... 

Now taking into account the partnerships throughout, for example, Microsoft, Amazon, (Meta as I am sure they are hiding the NDA as currently Meta is testing Blackberry End to End point Cryptagraphy for the messenger app throughout - WhatsApp, Instagram and FB - and their will be a large dollar figure paid to Blackberry quarterly on completion of the testing and implementation), and these are just a few players in the game..... 

Now reviewing the next item, how many EV manufactures has BB captured through out the global stage, with their self driving software? From my limited understanding I have been told all of them, excluding one, that being Tesla. And what did Tesla just do? Did they just not shutdown their auto pilot department? [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut) now why would they do such a thing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now then we come to the next item of concern, the Apple Killer, the Tesla PI Phone, now is this reliable or not?? Who am I to guess, though it makes sense,  [https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/](https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/) \- and where does this lead us, well Blackberry sure did create a great deal of despair when the legacy patent deal did not come through, though if you believe that deal was ever anymore than a jab to blind the investors, so they would give into more FUD, as the inside players are feasting on the insider knowledge, and the retail players are just being decimated, as i am sure if you do a bit of research it becomes clear very quickly the moral characters you are dealing with when you review the board members (one in particular who disgraces Warren buffet by referring to himself as the CDN one). 

And of course this post will get slaughtered by the reddit bots, who are against anyone doing anything other than holding bags, but for some reason, I would like to speak out and tell those who are having hard times to take a look at this, as the calls are cheap the SP is in the gutter, though all the fundamentals are in place, and it is evident management has been burning the books to ensure profitability is not seen, though what do I know I am just some guy who wishes he lived in his mom basement, though I am not that blessed...

169,1660658623,wpv6qq,1,"First, as part of any great DD, I looked at BBBY’s stock price in June, around $6 per share. Then I used the internet to check what web traffic BBBY had in July compared to June. About 41M visitors to their webpage, up from 38M in June. That’s an 8% increase. More web traffic = More customers = More revenue = Higher stock price. Makes sense.

Then I looked at how many people that downloads BBBY’s mobile app (because converting app users to real clients that spend money is tight). Up from around 1,800 daily downloads in June to 3,000 in July. That’s an 72% increase!

Then I looked at how many followers BBBY has on Facebook. Towel-buying people loves Facebook and guess what!? 8,000 new followers since June, a modest increase of 0.3%.

And last but not least, and this is when it gets really advanced, I compared the number of mentions on Reddit in June to the start of August. Because reddit mentions = higher stock price. BBBY was mentioned around 50 times per day in June BUT 3,000 times per day in the last week. That’s an increase of 5900%.

Now, if I know anything about percentages, it is that you add them all up. So 8% + 72% + 0.3% + 5900%. That’s an increase in 5980.3%!!

So you take the percentage increase of 5980.3% \* $6 and you get what the stock is really worth - $365!

172,1660530769,wonv8n,1,"I recently commented some dumb shit about my fucked up life in the daily thread and it gave me a great idea. WSB needs more community made ETFs to profit off of fucked up real world situations. BECKY is not enough, I honestly don't even think it scratches the surface. Divorce, though sad, is a massive opportunity to turn other peoples pain and confusion into profit. Bottom line, I'm pissed at my Mom and I want my money back, so this is how I plan on getting it. 

Fellas and girl, I present to you, MOMWHY: The Divorce ETF.

Google says that most divorces are caused by these 5 things:
-infidelity
-addiction
-lack of Intimacy 
-money
-communication 

I will look at each of these causes using my own personal experience as a child that grew up in a divorced household, and curate a list of 5 stocks that I consider to be leaders in profiting off of the pain and confusion of a family being torn apart. 



INFIDELITY. Classic. When your wife turns out to be batshit insane, you might be more inclined to say fuck it and go on that deep sea fishing trip in Costa Rica. While you're down there, you may find yourself surprised that Costa Rican hookers can be quite attractive and affordable, especially if you're a white upper middle class banker wearing a polo and a visor. But when you return to your miserable wife in the states and realize that your dick has a rash, you're going to panic and throw money at anything that will make the rash disappear before your wife feels guilty for not being around much and decides to blow you for 30 miserable seconds. 

The infidelity pick was obvious. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ). Rest assured that when your dick itches and marriage falls apart, Johnson &amp; Johnson will be there with every oil, creme, soap, shampoo, and ointment for your infidelity needs.





ADDICTION. Too easy. Constellation Brands (STZ) is balls deep in alcohol and weed. You'll drink and smoke away the pain and confusion, and so will your kids when they realize that Dad wasn't an alcoholic boogeyman, he was just sad, And then Mom took the house he bought. 




LACK OF INTIMACY. This one is tricky. It's easy to profit off of Intimacy, but a LACK of it? When Dad comes home from his miserable job, all he wants is to get trashed and watch the game. When Mom comes home from her miserable job, all she wants to do is offload her toxic negativity onto her kids and husband. The kids are either covering their ears while Dad is yelling at the TV, or covering their ears while Mom is yelling at them. 

💡💡💡BUT WHAT'S THE DOG DOING?????
Enjoying the FUCK out of that overpriced Greenie Dental Chew. 
Chewy Inc. (CHWY)
next.




MONEY. If you had enough money, you wouldn't have to work 9-5 Monday thru Friday and completely miss out on your kid's childhoods and then overcompensate for it in their late teens by making them do a bunch of stupid shit outside with you that neither you nor them actually want to do. If you had money, you might actually have a chance at being a competent parent and a  contributing member of society. 

But the reality is that you don't have money so everything is fucked. You know who knows you don't have money and figured out a way to charge you for it? Wells Fargo (WFC).

Did you know that the CEO of Wells Fargo once had a yacht named ""Overdraft"" ?🚣‍♂️🚣‍♂️🚣‍♂️




COMMUNICATION. You might think that communication is lowest between the husband and wife in a divorce. In reality, communication is lowest between the parents and kids in a divorce. The parents don't regard their kids as human beings. They regard them as slightly higher than the dog on the totem pole, but really not that much higher. By age 7, the kids will totally give up on trying to communicate with their parents as well. Instead, the kids will use their fat stacks of cash gifted by parents and grandparents that feel guilty during the holidays and use it to buy:

Video games. Why deal with the bullshit when you can ignore it? Why live in reality when you can strap on a pair of goggles and live in a different reality? 
This pick might not be popular among some of you, but there's a clear winner for denying reality out there. Facebook/Meta whateverthefuck (FB).


There we have it folks🤮💩



 
MOMWHY: A DIVORCE ETF

- Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) because your Johnson itches ✅

- Constellation Brands (STZ) because your kids will get crossfaded ✅

- Chewy Inc. (CHWY) because the dog is fuckin CHILLIN regardless✅

- Wells Fargo (WFC) because if you had enough money, you wouldn't be getting a divorce ✅

185,1659642772,wgaiq6,1,"Block, Inc., formerly Square, Inc., is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.

Consider the fact that the company's stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&amp;P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.

**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**

https://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq

Square on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. 

In its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.

Cash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.

**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**

At the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.

Square is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square's gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.

Square and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.

**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**

In a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.

""Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term,"" he wrote.

Announced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging ""[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)"" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM).

Square stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.

**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**

For merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there's still a risk of defaults.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App's direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.

Square is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.

The Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company's subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.

To broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma's tax business for $50 million in cash. It's a free service for consumers.

**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**

With roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved ""upmarket,"" targeting larger businesses.

SQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).

In addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.

Square recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.

**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**

The company's Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.

Meanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.

Square on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.

In trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.

One key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume — total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers — also known as GPV. It's a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.

**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Square earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.

Square said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.

Financial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.

Gross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.

In a letter to shareholders, management said: ""Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square.""

Excluding Afterpay, the company said ""gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year.""

**Block Stock Technical Analysis**

After its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.

That soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google in stature.

Following its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019.

I think Meta is still on a downward spiral, and it's not the bottom yet. These are my thoughts only, and not extensive DD...not much science, lots of intuition and anecdotal perspectives. I wanted to post here for you to challenge and see what others might think.

Meta's main business is advertisement - and these ads are not selling nearly as well as they used to. With Apple's significant changes to iOS and Safari, this cripples advertisers ability to target users as well as before. This is resulting in fewer ads being sold as advertisers are moving to other channels and overall putting less value into FB/IG ads.Some anecdotal evidence that might be the tip of the iceberg for Meta ads business continuing to decline. Amex just put up an offer for advertisers to spend $350 and get $150 back. That's over 40% off! Almost always, these offers are funded by the actual company, not Amex - and Amex in fact sometimes charge the company to show these offers to their members. So we're likely looking at a \~10% fee that brings up the total cost to \~50% to Meta.

So if Meta is trying to buy revenue at 50% margin, that's pretty bad.Meta doesn't have that great margin already, and has been on a serious decline, down below 25% in the latest quarter. A year ago, it was 35% - that's a 28% drop in one year. And their debt is climbing every quarter as they continue to invest in metaverse (whatever that is) - with no realistic path to sustainable profitability in that new space (pun intended).

Reminder that the past quarters have been pretty grim too:

Doesn't help that TikTok is set to overtake Facebook on influencer spend despite having far fewer users. IG is still holding strong but I can see this declining as more and more influencers (and users) use TikTok instead of IG. IG is trying desperately to copy TikTok features, and it really only causes two things:

1. Validate user wants that TikTok is the preferred platform, train users to get used to the TikTok UI (migratory: shifts user / market share to TikTok)
2. Alienate users who DO NOT like the TikTok UI and they spend less overall time on social media (destructive: reduces the overall social media pie, and share for FB/IG)

191,1659452204,wedu0w,1," Meta Platforms Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told staffers the world's biggest social media company had planned for growth too optimistically, mistakenly expecting that a bump in usage and revenue growth during COVID-19 lockdowns would be sustained.

Zuckerberg, responding to an employee question at a company-wide meeting on Thursday, said he had hired too aggressively and failed to account for the possibility of an economic downturn, according to a person who heard the remarks.

The employee had asked about mistakes Zuckerberg had made, the person said.

Meta declined to comment.

The comments were more pointed than those Zuckerberg had delivered during an investor call the prior day, after Facebook-owner Meta recorded its first ever quarterly drop in revenue and forecast another fall to come in the third quarter.

On the investor call, Zuckerberg said he believed the economy was entering a downturn that would have a ""broad impact"" on the digital advertising business.

""It's always hard to predict how deep or how long these cycles will be, but I'd say that the situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago,"" he said.

He told investors the company planned to ""steadily reduce headcount growth"" over the next year.

At the company meeting on Thursday, another employee asked Zuckerberg if senior managers at Meta had been ""coasting,"" referencing an ongoing debate over the term since an executive this month told managers to ""move to exit"" any employees who were ""coasting"" or performing poorly.

Zuckerberg responded by discussing Meta's performance reviews generally, according to the person who heard him speak, as well as another briefed on the response.

The employee who raised the question then took to the comments section of an internal discussion board, writing that in his view Zuckerberg had not answered his question.

## “Get ready for war!” read a message posted by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) 80th Group over the US visit to Taiwan, as reported on Friday, July 29.

China’s Army’s war message over the potential US visit to Taiwan reportedly generated over 300,000 thumbs-up in just 12 hours, creating “high morale among Chinese soldiers” according to [Global Times.](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202207/1271742.shtml)

The message was posted on China’s social network Weibo, with pictures of the post since circulating on Twitter:

The post on China readying for war, comes after Nancy Pelosi, speaker for the United States House of Representatives, has enraged China after talks of a possible US visit to Taiwan, a move that would potentially recognise Taiwan as an independent sovereign state, and not as the Republic of China.

However, many politicians are concerned that now that the news of the hypothetical visit has spread, if the US does not send Pelosi, it will look like the nation has backed down in front of China.

# Facebook Parent Meta Loses $2.8B on Metaverse Division in Q2

  

By Nelson Wang

(CoinDesk)

Meta Platforms (FB) posted a second-quarter loss of $2.81 billion in its Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations, according to its earnings report released Wednesday. That was down slightly from its loss of $2.96 billion in the first quarter and better than analyst estimates for a loss of $3.67 billion for the division for the quarter, according to FactSet.

* FRL generated revenue of $452 million in the second quarter, down from revenues of $695 million in the first quarter. That was a small fraction of the $28.4 billion generated in the quarter from Meta’s family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
* The company said it expected Reality Labs revenue to be lower in the third quarter compared to Q2.
* Meta announced in last year’s fourth quarter that it would be breaking out results for the division to show the performance and investments in a group that it considers key to the next generation of online social experiences.
* For 2021, Meta reported a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion for FRL. The company has said it is committed to spending even more on the division for the next several years.
* On the company’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company's metaverse arm is currently ""laying the groundwork for a very successful 2030s.""
* Overall, Meta’s adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $2.46 missed analysts' average estimate of $2.54, according to FactSet, while its overall revenue of $28.8 billion fell just short of estimates of $28.9 billion.
* Meta's shares fell close to 4% to $163.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday on the results. Shares of Facebook are down more than 50% this year.

204,1658667181,w6uyfr,1,"Get into Congress.

The minimum salary for a member of congress is $174,000 a year.  

Now, that might seem like a lot of money.  Maybe, even a life-changing amount After all, the average American makes about three times less. 

But, in reality, that numbepr means very little to many of our politicians. That six-figure check is pretty insignificant when you compare it to the wealth of someone like nancy Pelosi, whose net worth is somewhere upward of $115 million. 

For reference, that ridiculous amount of money puts her in the top 0.1% of Americans and makes her one of the wealthiest politicians in this country. 

If she had made all that through her salary alone, never spending a penny, and only ever cashing in her current all-time high house speaker salary of $239,000 she would have had to work for over 500 years. 

Now, Pelosi is not a vampire despite what some very convincing Facebook posts say.  So, where did all this money come from?  Where do any of our politicians make their money? 

As it turns out, Nancy's situation isn't all that unique. Many congress people see their wealth grow by thousands of percentage points after they're elected and the majority of our federal lawmakers are full-on millionaires. 

For reference, and I can't believe I feel the need to say this, most Americans not millionaires! So, where does all this money come from? 

Let's stick with Pelosi for a bit. There are a few ways she and other politicians make their money but the first one we obviously have to talk about is investment using Nancy's public records. 

Researchers at Open Secrets found that in 2018 she invested $46.5 million in real estate, another $15.8 million in electronics manufacturing, and a cool $15 million into just Apple, admittedly this doesn't tell us where the spending money first comes from, we'll get to that later but this information still matters a lot that's because, as it turns out, Nancy Pelosi is an investment genius. 

Investing and doing a bang-up job at it has been one of the big ways she and her husband paul have been able to multiply their fortunes during her tenure as a politician between 2020 and 2021. 

The Pelosi's traded over $50 million  in assets for an annualized return of 69%, nice! 

Now, that number doesn't mean anything to me except the obvious thing. So, I googled it and this is about six to seven times higher than the average stock market return, making her a better investor than Warren  Buffett, George Soros, and Kathy Wood, whose whole deal is investing! 

They don't spend any time holding elected office or anything.  The point is that these returns are incredibly lucrative, while millions of Americans fell into poverty because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pelosi's wealth grew by an eye-watering $16.7 million! 

So, of course, when a reporter asks her the question, ""Should members of Congress and their spouses be banned from tradingindividual stocks while serving in congress?""

She said, ""No!"" 

Okay, Pelosi is an incredibly ""talented""  investor and it might be tempting to single her out, but none of this is all that unusual. It turns out, Congress  people have always been surprisingly good at investing! 

You might remember these four from the start of the pandemic in February. This  one wrote this article where he says, ""The  U.S. is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats,"" but then a week later he did this. 

Weird. 

Well, not really before the rest of us knew how bad COVID-19 would get, but after internal briefings by the CDC and Fauci on the severity of the upcoming Pandemic. 

These four senators dumped a whole bunch of money they held in the stock market right as it was about to crash. They all made hundreds of thousands of dollars presumably using information not disclosed to the public. 

But, hey now, maybe they're just really good investors? 

The DOJ certainly seems to think so, since all the investigations into what they did have since been closed. 

Seems reasonable. 

Here again, I want to be clear that what these senators did is not special. I had led with the people with names and faces, but this trend is bigger than four senators and the Pelosi's. 

Congress people have always been surprisingly good at investing! 

A five-month-long business insider investigation found that at least 49 members of congress and 182 high-ranking congressional staffers engage in insider trading. 

Multiple successive academic reports that looked into senatorial stock returns have consistently found that, overall, senators are just really good at beating the market!

Why? Well, if you look at a 2017 report by Public Citizen about senators and stock trading, you'll find that many individual senators often trade stocks in businesses that they oversee in their official capacity. 

I'm no expert but this might be a problem, no? 

What do I know? I should just listen to people like Pelosi who always know what to say and have the best explanations for why this isn't a problem. 

Truly airtight arguments because this is a free market. 

Makes sense to me. Everybody say thank you to Mrs. Pelosi for that valuable lesson in economics but fine what if investments and abuses of information couldn't explain any of the astonishing wealth of our politicians? 

Another good place to look is lobbying. Lobbying is a very very well-funded industry. In 2021, $3.7 billion were spent on federal lobbying alone. 

As you can see from this list the top spenders are almost exclusively businesses large industries and the firms that represent them. 

You can put that info on a graph and it looks like this, Labor and Citizen special interests represent almost nothing. If lobbying were a bag of Chex mix, you'd be getting like one rye chip per 50 handfuls of pretzels. 

But, the thing with lobbying is that it doesn't work like an outright bribe. There's a lot of money in lobbying but in the grand scheme of things, the amounts that are actually spent mean very little to the politicians. 

While I can tell you that Nancy Pelosi got $180k from officially registered lobbyists,  she's not really getting that money for herself. That money mainly goes into campaign financing and then there's all sorts of amounts not on this list that go into things like, extravagant dinners. 

In any case, it's not where the millions of dollars in the Pelosi bank account are coming from, lobbying gets money into political hands in a much more indirect way that's sustained by a mutually beneficial relationship to get the wheels turning on this relationship. 

Lobbies will get close to politicians using a business's wealth to build rapport that can be translated into favorable legislation or outright subsidies essentially. 

They'll pay for ways to sit at the same table at a nice restaurant or get an hour in the right office. 

Why? 

Well, one study estimates that every dollar spent on lobbying returns an average of $760. 

If that number seems a little high to you, and it might very well be, regardless of what the actual amount is, it will always be more than what's put in. 

Businesses wouldn't lobby if it didn't serve them. 

But, that's just what businesses get from lobbying, what about politicians? 

Well, for politicians, the benefits of lobbying are split between long-term and short-term benefits. 

In the long term, politicians know that two-thirds of them will leave politics to enter the lobbying industry once their years in government will have made them very valuable assets to lobbyists and therefore come with a nice big bag of money with a dollar sign on it. 

That means that politicians spend years in office greasing the revolving door that'll let them leave government with lucrative jobs in the industries they cozied up to during their tenure. 

But, that's for the long term. In the short term, cozying up to lobbyists can come with other more immediate benefits. 

For example, in 2008, after VISA made a few small contributions to Pelosi's campaign, her husband paul was granted privileged access to a VISA IPO, where he was able to invest a large sum of money before stock prices went up and all Nancy had to do was stall the passage of a law that would cut into VISA'S PROFITS. 

Which she did. 

But fine, let's keep going and assume investment and lobbying mean absolutely nothing to these people's wallets. 

The reality is a lot of our politicians are just exceptionally wealthy right off the bat. While a lot of politicians use their office as an elevator into the upper strata, many others come in fully formed using government only to exaggerate their already impressive wealth. 

That's the case for the Pelosi's whose shared

finances are built on the venture capital firm that Paul founded. The company with probably the least googlable name in the world:  

***FINANCIAL LEASING SERVICES***

I know I focused on the Pelosi's a lot in this video but this applies to like half our politicians and there's a reason for that. 

Being wealthy opens up a corridor to political life that being an average American just doesn't. 

At the personal level, being wealthy means you don't have to worry about keeping a full-time job while you run or making sure you have food on the table and a roof over your head. 

That's huge but that's not where the biggest benefits come from. The main reason the wealthy have such an easy time taking over politics comes from the fact that their incentives align with those of established parties. 

Political parties have an incentive to promote wealthier candidates and support them more because wealth begets wealth. 

Wealthy candidates come with wealthy connections that can be used to fundraise and finance ever more expensive campaigns. 

Wealthy candidates have a lot of friends who would all benefit from them winning and who will, therefore, be willing to raise money that parties can use to beat their opponents. 

Wealthy candidates also do not pose a threat to this model in a way that less wealthy more normal representatives do. 

If the only way you can get people into office is with generous checks from the wealthy, and that truly is the only reliable way to do it, then a candidate who opposes wealth of this kind threatens your party's whole electoral strategy. 

The wealthy do not want to finance a party that will take their dominant position in society away from them. 

People who do not look like you and me, who do not live the same lives, who do not face the same living conditions, make it into politics way more often just because it's easier for them than it is for a genuine representative of a country's citizens. 

Hence, this is why most Congress people are millionaires and most Americans aren't. 

And the thing is, there are real consequences. Our politics aredramatically influenced by all these different relationships to the capitalist class whether it's because of its disproportionate amount of seats at the table, its powerful use of lobbying, or the fact that it's in the best interest of politicians invested in the stock market to cater to capital. 

#These people are not like you, they do not represent you, and they don't act in your interest. 

This doesn't mean that not a single law gets passed that protects those who work for a living, those laws just aren't the priority they get artificially delayed, pared down to the bare minimum, and written carefully to only sacrifice the short-term interest of capital for the long-term survival of the capitalist economy. 

What matters is not the individual battles, it's that the overall outcome doesn't threaten profitability, the balance of power is on their side.

Wrestling it away and putting that power back in the hands of the people is the. first priority.","How to become a better investor than Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Kathy Wood",1.0,2022-07-24 12:53:01

 **Amazon, Earnings announcement Jul 28, 2022, after the market close:**

Amazon has been on a streak recently. The wrong kind of streak, though. Disappointing investors. Revenues are expected to grow 6% to reach $119.5 billion. EPS is expected to get crushed due to inflationary pressures. Of course, AWS will be on focus.

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on ten analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.51. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $3.61. Revenue is also forecast to dip 0.2% to $29.0 billion due to weaker advertiser demand and lower ad prices on Facebook and Instagram.

Daily active users and monthly active users numbers will be in focus. Market participants will also pay attention to how much money Facebook is willing to spend on its reality labs segment.

**2. Macro Economic indicators**:

First, let’s start by saying that the macro picture is not looking good.

**A. PMI:**

Flash US PMI Composite Output Index registered 47.5 in July, down notably from 52.3 in June, to signal a solid contraction in private sector output. The rate of decline was the sharpest since the initial stages of the pandemic in May 2020, as both manufacturers and service providers reported subdued demand conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/lixfejanbgd91.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a73b97a69767e3104933250b492ef4a1bf896120

**B. Philly Fed New Orders:**

Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is based on The Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in the Third Federal Reserve District. Participants report the direction of change in overall business activity and the various measures of activity at their plants: employment, working hours, new and unfilled orders, shipments, inventories, delivery times, prices paid, and prices received.

Philadelphia Fed said Thursday [its gauge of regional business activity](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/manufacturing-business-outlook-survey) dropped to negative 12.3 in July from negative 3.3 in the prior month.

Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal expected a 1.6 reading.

Any reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions in the manufacturing sector. This is the second straight month in contraction territory.

https://preview.redd.it/bd2pp4bqbgd91.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7409ed29e70c2ff987955877777902e535cc2aa9

**C. Dr. Copper**:

Copper (The commodity) predicts turning points in global economic cycles. The reason for that is because Copper is used in almost every sector. Demand for Copper is a reliable leading indicator of economic health. How do you gauge the demand? By looking at the price of Copper. Rising Copper prices indicate that demand for the commodity is strong, hence, a growing global economy. A decline in prices suggests the opposite. Copper had fallen into a bear market in the run-up to each of the last four recessions dating back to 1990, as the chart below shows. Copper fell into a bear market from its peak (-24%) in May 2021.

 **D. Inverted Yield Curve** 

The yield curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the San Francisco Fed. And yes, the yield curve is inverted. 

 **3. Federal Reserve Rate hikes, inflation, and expectations:**

Currently, it seems like the Fed will stick to a 75 bps rate hike in July. In June inflation print was 9.1%, hitting 40 year high. Expectations were that the Fed would become more aggressive and hike rates by 100 bps (1%). Hawkish Fed members are supporting a 75 bps hike and not 100 bps.

 **4. GDP Release:**

Gross Domestic Product will be released Thursday, July 28, 2022. Economists were expecting the U.S. economy to fall into recession somewhere in 2023. On July 1st, the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker showed that the U.S. economy might already be in a recession. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow gauge sees the second quarter at a negative 2.1%. Coupled with the first quarter’s decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession.",The most important week of 2022.,1.0,2022-07-24 05:29:12

208,1658518671,w5jbnz,1,"**Brief Bear Case for $META (tl;dr)**: 

After ER misses from $SNAP &amp; $TWTR, falling FB &amp; IG App Store metrics, and continued dominance from TikTok, $META puts into earnings look like a reasonable trade. However, with an IV rank of 94% (IV has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. If you don’t have time to read, that means I’m arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring July 29th ahead of $META’s earnings.

**First, some facts:**

* $META carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.

📷

* February 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% — the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02B.
* $META shares recently reached a fresh &gt;2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.
   * Prior to that, $META reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20. 
      * How brief? The week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $META closed at $154.34 — $0.09 above its most recent June low. 
      * The week following (beginning 3/23/20) $META closed at $156.79 — $2.54 above its most recent low.
      * Outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $META has respected the $154 level since early 2019.

📷

* Since reporting earnings in February of 2022, shares of $META have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758. 
   * Despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in April of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.
   * The bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $META’s pandemic low of $137.10.

📷

* TikTok continues to dominate Facebook, Instagram and Messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.

📷

* On a list of the top grossing apps in the US, Tiktok places 3rd, Facebook places 84th. Instagram and Messenger are too low to feature.

📷

* Lastly, Zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of Meta. 
   * [Meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)
   * CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.

&gt;""If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&amp;A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.

**Conclusion**: 

BearishIn the wake of $SNAP and $TWTR missing earnings on the top and bottom line, Tiktok’s continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $META shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $META’s earnings this Thursday. 

However, with a 94% IV rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and IV crush to contend with, it’s critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.

**The Trade Structure**: Put Debit Spreads

**Safe**: Targeting the $155 support level. 

**Lotto**: Target the $137 support level if $META breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it’s downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.

For July 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** — Risking $6.00 for a profit of $9.00, breakeven of $164 and maximum value of $15.00 if $META satisfies its 10.5% expected move. 

**OR** 

For July 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** — Risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $META has another outsized earnings move like it did in February, targeted at the next area of support.

**Alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts — Risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $META falls to it’s pandemic low. 

No matter which trade you pick, it’s important to collect at least *some* premium on this. Holding through earnings is risky business, IV crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, OTM options, which is why we want to target the ATM $170 strike for our long position. 

**Trade Headwinds**: 

* $META’s earnings report falls on July 27th, after market close — directly in between the FOMC’s next rate hike meeting (July 26th) and directly before we get QoQ GDP data (July 28th, 8:30 AM EST). That means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $META earnings and GDP data. If the GDP reaction is bad, that’s a big tailwind. If the GDP reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can’t afford from a time basis.
* Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reports are due on July 26th — right before $META. A positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.

Despite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $META ahead of earnings. 

**The Wrap Up**

Use $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $META’s earnings to target the current &gt;2 year low and an average move of 10.5% — OR — Target the $137 pandemic low if you’re looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).

Facebook parent Meta said on Wednesday that the privacy change Apple made to its iOS operating system last year will decrease the social media company's sales this year by about $10 billion. META stock is going to dive in the next quarter report. Zuckerberg is desperate, and has fired a lot of people to minimize losses.

The company's metaverse business, Reality Labs, continued to struggle in the first three months of the year, losing $2.96 billion. The most recent losses follow an over $10 billion spending spree by the metaverse unit in 2021.

Mark Zuckerberg said he plans to invest heavily in his company’s metaverse ambitions and that will mean losing “significant” amounts of money on the project in the next three to five years.

219,1657188905,vtf90s,1,"Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has recently been a staple of “investing meme” space since early 2022. Throughout social media, she is both famous and infamous for her lucrative investments in the stock market. TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit - throughout various channels of social media, you will find investing influencers publicizing and discussing the congresswoman’s latest stock trades as a proxy to get ahead in the stock market.

According to the STOCK (stop trading on congressional knowledge) act, all members of Congress must disclose any financial transaction of stocks within 45 days of purchase, and the trades they make are accessible to the public. Discussion of these trades has especially been active on “r/wallstreetbets”, a subreddit forum where retail investors discuss current stock market trends; the same subreddit in which retail investors banded together to influence the market through the GameStop short squeeze back in January 2021.

Part of the reason why Nancy Pelosi has garnered so much social media attention is due to her successes – one after another…after another. In July 2021, she made $5.3 million by exercising call options to buy 4000 shares of google, moments before the House Judiciary Committee voted on antitrust regulation. Other very profitable stock picks like Tesla, CrowdStrike, and Apple have drawn the eyes of retail investors, even causing a debate about whether Congress members should be allowed to dabble in the stock market or not.

The multi-millionaire congresswoman has done quite well in the stock market - but she has a competitive advantage: her husband. Paul Pelosi, who was recently arrested and charged with a DUI, runs a venture capital firm and is responsible for all the trades that Pelosi files. According to the New York Post, Pelosi has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by nearly 15% in 2020 - Paul seems to be more responsible with his wife's investments than he is behind the wheel. In light of her success, young retail investors are attempting to copy her stock moves to identify long-term winners.

235,1655493281,venpo1,1,"So I've been thinking about the Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI).  In case you don't know, in Jan Microsoft announced an all cash purchase of ATVI for $68.7B ($95/share) at the time it was trading around $65 / share and promptly shot up to the mid 80s before settling back down mid $70s.   The only reason the stock was down in the 60s is that it got dragged down by allegations of sexual impropriatey by key people in the company.  The Microsoft news turned it around, but as I noted it quickly came back down.  Why?  Because there's talk that this merger could be blocked by antitrust enforcement.   

I honestly don't buy it:  

EA acquired Codemasters, Playdemic, Glu Mobile

Facebook acquired Oculus

Sony acquired Bungie

Activision acquired King

Take-Two acquired Zynga

An article on Bloomberg dated April 28 says that the $95 per share offer (24% premium) represents risk buyout won't close.  WAIT A MINUTE THOUGH - it's only 24% premium because the stock got hammered leading up to the deal announcement.  I'm guessing MSFT didn't wake up in Jan and decide to buy.  Exactly 1 year prior ATVI was trading mid 90s and only started slumping on sexual allegation issues. 

I don't believe antitrust will factor, I think the deal is happening - and it has 1 year to happen  (Jun 23).  So, here was my approach.  I bought 100 shares of ATVI \~74.98.  I sold a covered call for $1,165 @ 75 strike for Dec 20, 2024.  I can hear your thought process: ""That's 31 months... that's only 15.5% return... that's like 6% per year... that SUCKS!!!""

\^ Yes it does.  But that's \[one of\] the *worst* case scenarios.  

Let's say the acquisition goes through in June 2023... my shares are gone, and my premium now earned me 14.4% annually.  

Let's say it goes south, and the deal falls through.  The sexual impropriety stuff was just cleared by investigation, but if the stock tanks below my strike, I can easily buy back my call at a fraction, or hang onto it as additional downside protection.  

Last, let's say it goes south, and stock just flounders around or slowly climbs... well then you're right I earned 6% per year and missed out gains.  Oh well. 

There's lots of other strike prices that could include intrinsic value if you want less downside protection and a potentially higher return.  Anyhow, something to think about.

And as a free add-on teach the greedy corporates a lesson in macro economics.

Let's team up and let the below message go viral - fire on all social media cylinders.

*Inflation needs two to play: greedy corporates and* ***consumers to accept higher prices****.*

*Join the viral experiment of the century and* ***reverse the trend****. Spread the word and* ***follow below inflation-killers between 1st July to 30th September****:*

1. *Postpone any spending that is not absolutely necessary right today.*
2. *Food, drinks: Spend the minimum you can, only buy the necessary, less premium products, less meat, less brand, more local stuff, don’t stock up. Buy at the lowest price chains.*
3. *Rent, property, large investments, cars: offer 15% below ask - walk away if you don‘t get 10% below ask; don‘t flip if you don‘t have to.*
4. *Purchases few $100s to 1’000s: negotiate prices, walk away if they don‘t concurr.*
5. *Online shopping: stop for 2 months unless absolutely necessary. You have already most you need.*
6. *Leisure: spend less, do more at home or outside, avoid commerce, cancel subscriptions.*
7. *Transport: it‘s all about using less fuel, i.e. use car pool, bus, train, e-bike, walk instead of own car and airplane.*
8. *Holidays: no airplane, stay local, couch surf, camping, hostel, local B&amp;B instead of hotel or AirBnB; call and negotiate rates down.*
9. *Food in restaurants: do it less, chose the ones with less inflated prices, let them know you reduce tips or order less by the amount they increased the price.*
10. *Utilities: increase AC by a few degrees; decrease heating by a few degrees; shower shorter, colder.*

*Share this message on all channels – if just a few % of the population act on this, this will make a real impact.* ***It will get you personally more money in the bank – and in the best case make a dent in inflation!***

*Why should it work? Best example is energy: during Covid oil demand crashed by 30%, prices went below 0. If we get the world to rduce oil demand by 5% we can achieve a significant balance towards over supply - that will bring prices down. Other examples: air travel: if planes won‘t get filled they will reduce prices. If rent ask prices are not met they will accept lower bids.*

*And remember: the only ones really with an interest to stop inflation is you, the consumer (mid- and lower class). Anyone else is happy with inflation, in particular the rich, corporates, politics, and governments.*

*This will work if we can make it a global, viral movement. So distribute and fire on all cylinders - reddit, facebook, twitter, Insta, tiktok, LinkedIn, 9gag, etc.*

I lived through the blackout in 2003, and old-timers here still talk about the absolute chaos that reigned during the 1977 blackout (anybody reading this remember that?).

* Small syphon for extracting gasoline from cars (junkyards use these)

* Canned fish

* Honey

It’s quite expensive ($3 an oz), addictive, and has a plethora of uses, from digestive health, to the highest quality hair and beauty products. My theory here was that I could buy nature’s most nutrient-dense food (expiration dated 2027), which is a guilty pleasure I enjoy at even the best of times, and if I didn’t need it because *homo sovieticus* ended his Ukraine incursion, it’s easy to sell—and would keep pace with inflation.

This is where Zuck’s legacy business is at its finest IMO, where finally it's taken on the look of what it is, and there’s no reason for all the smooth skin and color grading of that weird metaverse shit. Because right now, people need to offset their losses at the pump and prices elsewhere which have put a green candle through heaven’s floorboards. Anyway, I joined Zuck’s Silk Road Marketplace--this was back in late March this year, listing a single unit of 8.8 oz Manuka honey. No deals, no bogo, listing it 5% higher than the current retail price. And I said this:

*“When someone actually buys this, we’ll know we’re either at, or very near the mid-term market bottom.”*

On June 9th, contact was made with a buyer.

Messenger sounded from across the room and my eyes met Ira’s. We were getting ready to fish in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Ira had a Yeti cooler filled with that Sierra Nevada Torpedo, an IPA so sour you might as well fill a growler with rainbow-slicked water from an East River tributary. I cautiously approached my phone. I don’t use Facebook/Messenger for anything other than Marketplace window shopping by the way, checking in anytime ABC7 airs surveillance footage of a group running not from a teen making good on his 4chan manifesto, but fleeing to the safety of Meta Marketplace with armfuls of Veblen goods, purloined from the racks, displays, and mannequins of luxury stores.

*“Is this still available?”* The message innocently read. 

*“Ira!”* I called, but he was already wide-eyed staring over my shoulder, past my phone screen unimpeded, and into that ultimate secret place, which we all know is called the *portfolio*.

*“Yes,”* I wrote back, visibly shaking. 

Ira had me pull up the price of oil while he was there. WTI was trading at $122 bbl. He hissed. 

What I didn’t tell you is that I made a promise to myself in March to go long when that honey got sold. But was it an outlier? Was my tickler into the future the result of something else? Ira back then squared his shoulders and boasted he’d lever up if it sold. So here we find ourselves Ira and I small figures in a curious situation. Because this honey sale coincides closely with $280 QQQ. That’s my line in the sand. 

We’re only 2.5% away from that. That was the bottom last month and it held. Will it be a double-bottom? If it doesn’t hold, I’ll go on record here, in the presence of this hardened audience and say, we’ll have a 1929 moment this summer, and it will be a Japanese financial implosion. I’m am telling you now, they can't withstand the lows that come after a break of $280 QQQ and what that decollateralizes. And since Japan is the happy buyer of the majority of our debt (China has been offloading Treasuries since 2010), such an event should set the USD like a marble ready to get fired into the parabola of hyperinflation, which I posit, China’s naval blockade of Taiwan will force. Two Decisions we’ll have to make as I talked about in a previous post China will force with their 2023 blockade:

* Go to war and go hyper
* Don’t go to war and lose the 21st century

For the prudent trader, it would seem $280 QQQ is made for the option play known as a *straddle*, whereby an equal amount of calls and puts are bought at the same strike price with the same expiration date. 

If $280 breaks, then I’d assume a 50% drawdown is logical. Bear markets last an average of 289 days. A bear market is defined as a drawdown of more than 20% in any 4Q period. On the other side of this bear however, I don’t know what money or collateral will look like. More on that momentarily. 

If $280 holds, then I’d expect horn gore. Complete bullish horn gore. Whatever alleles on WSB genes exist for greed will be fully expressed. We’ll challenge the ATH (not in real terms of course because of inflation) before the famine comes destabilizing the Middle-East and North Africa, before the Turkish Lira’s hyperinflation to nada and destabilization, before the resulting EU immigration crisis, Japan’s implosion, and the Taiwan blockade in early 2023. It’ll be a World War sure, it just won’t resemble any of the ones from your grade-school text book photographs. It’ll be a war of currencies, commodities, supply chains, and infrastructure. China has an enormous amount of silver. They have possibly 20x more gold than we know. Russia has a large amount of gold. China is hellbent on percolating their digital Yuan. 

All of this is partly why I’m hyper-bullish on **digital** gold—**₿**, my theory being: 

A REVERSE 6102 STYLE ATTACK

Yes, goldbugs will take it from the other end this time. If things get out of control (really out of control), then the West could presumably defund their enemy’s ambitions by coordinating and dumping their gold on the open market. Protection would be too expensive as derivative premiums reprice upwards. It would obliterate the price of gold—permanently—and they could embrace **₿**, which the West has all the **efficient** mining and most of the hashpower for (59% renewable energy and growing rapidly), most of the nodes which actually control consensus, all the top programmers, and all of the libertarian anti-authoritarian culture. **₿**’s smallest unit could reprice, then a credit market develop around it, and it would emerge as universal collateral, whereby every discrete payment network switches to using its L2, and I’m not certain most people would know the difference in their day-to-day lives.

I like it in any setting. But what I like about it in a wartime setting is that it’s universal, impairment resistant, and unconstrained by borders, with the only thing required to get started being a free mobile app. It can be THE capital flight release valve anywhere for anyone and no government can stop their citizens from saving themselves or loved ones. 

Centralized money targets a stable price. This is a terrible system, but it must happen because it’s inflationary and centralized. So in order to maintain that stable price, you must have overwhelming intervention, tools, manipulation, collusion, and organizations to coordinate it. In many cases you need a military esp a global navy to enforce it. Even then boom &amp; bust cycles come. And eventually:

https://preview.redd.it/ziko3ey0y2591.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13bbd66b7aae680cb99d9ecc3abd9b50f4a54efb

And in the blue corner you the deflationary system. **₿** doesn’t target a stable price. It targets a variable price. It can control its ledger and issuance with the one-directional entropy of energy, and the free market sets the price. When it’s absorbed enough trust (value) its confidence curve (volatility) will flatten. That’s not something humans have ever seen, and it’s probably why after it absorbs enough trust, it’ll be man’s final money. It’ll be a transparent and honest base layer. Right now our base layer is fiat and debt. This is a dishonest base layer. Nothing built over it can ever be honest. Does distortion in money equal distortion in information? Maybe that’s what this transition period will be about, getting rid of that distortion, reigning in governments. Otherwise things that work get built in layers: a human body, an atom, planet, or pizza.

In the meantime I’m going long equities. Not levered, but long. It’s at odds with much of the data I’m looking at, and doesn’t feel natural at all. If $280 breaks then I’ll help Zuck heat up and subsidize my street-faring brethren in Marketplace.

We didn’t catch anything fishing but the Torpedo made the time pass pleasantly, under a clear blue sky unwrinkled and still. I asked Ira:

*“What’s American Exceptionalism if you have to put it into a short example.”*

He cast his line again and said something that bothered me as a NYC liberal, *“Probably the fact that in all fifty states you can legally carry a gun around in your waistband and its licensed by the state itself. Freedom is a package deal, amendment one is BS without amendment two.”* 

I sold the honey a couple hours later. 

But no, if $280 QQQ breaks American Exceptionalism is not going down with it.","I sent a feeler out into the future, and it just got back to me. Having a hard time interpreting its data. But if $280 QQQ breaks, will American Exceptionalism go down with it?",1.0,2022-06-12 00:00:42

“They’re  tired of the San Francisco workforce, which they think is full of  spoiled nitwits who are there one day and gone the next,” Cramer added.

Look at you. You’re a male and probably single. You use [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) for your social interactions because you don’t go anywhere on the weekends and wait for market open to gamble your life savings away since you have no wife or even kids to care for. 

So now enter Reddit in 2022. How is Reddit going to compete with the metaverse and keep your cucked eyeballs on here instead of VR? Now while we all may think the metaverse and VR is stupid, it’s where our worlds heading. 

So how does Reddit fit in to the [metaverse?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/07/virtual-reality-check-when-will-the-metaverse-vision-become-a-reality/amp/) Imagine Reddit right now. You open it, and see a series of threads or questions on a server. You read and reply. 

Now imagine being in a VR Reddit open world. There will be a central lobby where everyone starts out. Ever play COD WW2? Similar to that type of [lobby](https://youtu.be/JrU-aT5TNBM) where everyone chills until they go into a certain game. You essentially choose a “sub” to go into and you can talk to people in real time about the thread. So let’s say someone starts a conversation on wsb about how $KO is a buy, you’d basically be in a huge room with everyone else in the thread talking about it in real time. Reddit will eventually serve as the ultimate social server in the metaverse. The Redditverse! You’ll also be able to watch past threads and talk to them in “real time” because it’s all VR. 

The sad reality of this is if you think escapism is bad now? Oh boy, wait until everyone just meets people on the Redditverse and they never have any friends in real life. Wait until your wife finds her boyfriend in the Redditverse and he’s jacked online but some balding 40 year old virgin cuck in real life.

**THE MARKET**

My guess is Reddit will IPO sometime this year. It may go down like $HOOD at first. This will be the best time to yolo. Now, my guess is Reddit will be bought out by Meta. Now most people will be confused by this, but Facebook knows it will be making the Redditverse. More people like Reddit than Facebook, so it’s perfect.

In “King Richard,” the 2021 drama depicting the budding tennis careers of the Williams sisters, Will Smith’s character Richard Williams turns down so many huge opportunities for his daughter Venus that it makes your jaw drop. That worked out pretty well for her and her sister, Serena, in the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

If only social-media platform Reddit—co-founded by Serena Williams’s now husband, Alexis Ohanian —had that kind of nerve and timing. Redditors took the market by storm last year, fueling a retail frenzy in meme stocks such as GameStop that turned investing fundamentals [on their head](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-is-looking-to-reddit-for-investment-advice-11630056648?mod=article_inline), briefly making the WallStreetBets forum the center of the financial universe. Founded in 2005 in a dorm room, much like Facebook had been a year earlier, Reddit today is one of the most visited websites in the world with more than 50 million daily active unique users as of January.

But, financially at least, that is where the similarities end. In an era of tech hubris, Reddit is a rare case of underreach and founders who didn’t know when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em.

The company was sold in 2006 to media company Condé Nast for a mere $10 million. As of last August, it was privately valued at $10 billion. In late 2020, Mr. Ohanian tweeted that, at the time of the sale, he thought he was “getting away with something” after what amounted to just 16 months of work and more than his parents had made in their entire lives. He wrote that, back then, there were a lot of things he “desperately” needed to learn such as management, team building and leadership. A better sense of timing would have been handy, too.

Co-founder Steve Huffman, who now serves as chief executive officer, presumably has the management part down, and it looked as if he had learned to strike while the financial iron is hot. Reddit doubled its value in a private transaction just days after GameStop mania, also launching its first-ever Super Bowl ad. But the [plans to raise capital](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-seeking-more-individual-investors-to-participate-in-its-share-offering-11634589541?mod=article_inline) were made before the episode.

Less auspicious was Reddit’s waiting to [file confidentially](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddit-files-paperwork-for-initial-public-offering-11639625013?mod=article_inline) to go public until late last year, just as tech-stock valuations began to turn. An expected offering in the first quarter led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley never happened. Sentiment has since gone sharply downhill for the ad-based social-media business.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is down 23% this year. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Fidelity Investments had slashed Reddit’s valuation in April, marking down its stake by more than a third from the preceding month. And since then, Snap Inc., parent of ads-based social-media platform Snapchat, lowered its guidance, citing an unfavorable macroeconomic environment that has deteriorated “further and faster” than it had anticipated. That declaration led to a single-day drop in Snap’s stock of 43%, dragging the entire social-media sector [down with it](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oh-snap-there-goes-socials-online-ad-biz-11653386581?mod=article_inline).

When Reddit’s WallStreetBets became a place that critics said helped separate fools from their money, including having “diamond hands”—holding on during a speculative frenzy—it earned Mr. Huffman an audience with Congress. He testified that investing advice on the forum was “probably among the best” because it has to be embraced by a crowd. Next time, he probably should just embrace whatever WallStreetBanks tell him.

* **Google employees say there’s growing anxiety internally that layoffs may be coming.**
* **A recent change in performance reviews along with increased chatter about cuts to travel budgets and swag is contributing to the concern.**
* **Google is coming off its weakest quarter for revenue growth since 2013, other than one period during the pandemic.**

 As industry-wide layoffs hit bigger tech names, some Google workers worry they’re next.

While Google has so far avoided the widespread job cuts that have hit tech companies, particularly those supported by a slumping ad market, internal anxiety is on the rise, according to documents viewed by CNBC and employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Alphabet executives have stressed the need to sharpen “focus,” bring down costs of projects and make the company 20% more efficient. There’s also been a recent change in performance reviews, and some employees point to declining travel budgets and less swag as signs that something bigger may be on the horizon.

In July, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai launched the “Simplicity Sprint” in an effort to bolster efficiency during an uncertain economic environment. Just a few miles up the road, Meta told employees this month that it’s laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, as the company reckons with declining ad revenue. Snap announced a 20% cut in August, and Twitter just slashed about half its workforce under the leadership of new owner Elon Musk. Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, HP said on Tuesday it plans to lay off 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next three years.

Google’s business hasn’t been hit as hard as many of its peers, but the combination of a potential recession, soaring inflation and rising interest rates is having a clear impact. Last month, the company said YouTube’s ad revenue shrank from a year earlier as Google generated its weakest period of growth since 2013, other than one quarter during the pandemic. Google said at the time that it would significantly reduce headcount growth in the fourth quarter.

The crypto market, which put a dent in Google’s latest results, has fallen even further with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, leading to increased concerns about industry contagion.

**Is $ZM a fading company?**

$ZM stock is now at its lowest since Jan 2020. 

The company was issued in April 2019 at the price of **62$** a stock in **NASDAQ**, reached its highest during COVID in 2020 at a stock price of **588$**, and since then made a decline to its current price of **77$.**

$ZM was founded in 2011 and launched in 2013 by Eric Yuan, a former Cisco engineer and executive. The company offers Zoom meetings via video, voice, and chats. The company makes working through a call or chat easy and accessible through the app’s special features, enabling sharing of images, videos, audio files, and content on a desktop or a laptop. 

$ZM started to accelerate when COVID hit, providing an effective and accessible way to continue working, studying, and hosting events online through lockdowns. 

The company also provides Zoom Contact Centre, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Developer platform. 

**So what happened to $ZM?** 

Maybe it’s the company struggling to adapt to a non-pandemic reality. Or maybe there are competitors with greater name recognition that gives them an advantage in the field.

With $ZM growth many competitors entered the game like Google meets and even META. These are huge companies with a large user base community.

&amp;#x200B;

* $ZM has a market cap of 23.89B
* $ ZM revenue in the last year increased by 5% from a year earlier in a compartment to a year earlier that had a 35% growth, and in 2020 that had 366% growth 
* Debt /Equity ratio 1.36 which is high for an asset-light company.
* Price to free cash flow is 17.95

Taking into account her competitors, her decline, and her statistics I would not recommend purchasing $ZM.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  
In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays. 

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014  
**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, im currently have

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so its pull the account value down, i got alot of time on most these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on. 

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much. 

# Major Economic Events

**Wednesday 11/09**

8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct  
9:45 AM S&amp;P PMI Flash Nov  
2:00 PM FOMC Minutes

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

# Earnings

# Monday 21 Nov

**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 &amp; Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.

# Tue 22 Nov

**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.032 &amp; Revenue $10.3B
* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings
* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell

# Wed 22 Nov

**Before Open - Deere &amp; Company ($DE)**

* Industrial
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $7.12 &amp; Revenue $13.5B
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.

Other notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE 

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

https://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c67c9f39558996148549530fec9a8ca90d2fbb

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

On Nov 15, the three major U.S. stock indexes closed in positive territory Tuesday, with the Dow up 0.17%, the NASDAQ up 1.45%, and the S&amp;P 500 up 0.87%. All three indexes pared gains in midday trading, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow briefly turning negative after a sudden missile attack in Poland and a surge in risk aversion.

The US producer price index (PPI) rose less than expected in October, both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis, clearly showing the broader trend of slowing inflation growth in the US and increasing the likelihood that the Fed will slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

Tencent Music rose 30.56 percent as overall results solidly beat expectations, with paying online music users growing 19.8 percent year on year to a record 85.3 million.

I won't lie after how good the last two seasons were, I was a little worried about this one continuing to deliver, but boy was I wrong. Powell's decision to kill off the word ""Transitory"" near the end of the 2021 season was a really interesting choice but has really been paying off throughout this season.

Although most of us could see it coming, the Red Wedding of tech/growth stocks has been one of my favorite themes. for some of us, watching Meta fall 70% has been as satisfying as watching Joffery die in GOT.

Skipping forward a bit to another one of my favorite bits was the Ryan Cohen towel store arc. This part of the season was very strong and brought in a ton of new viewers. Imo it was very clever of the writers to start RC out as a robinhood type character only for the twist to come, revealing that he's just another shitty billionaire who ended up using his cult following as exit liquidity.

And of course, there was the invasion of Ukraine, Elon buying Twitter, and the latest shocking episodes surrounding FTX, among many other things I'm too high to remember right now.

Would love to hear from you guys, what has been your favorite part, and where do you hope to see the writers take it into the end of this season and into the next?","The 2022 season of ""Stock Market""",1.0,2022-11-15 20:21:12

I want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.

I'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event.

298,1668450428,yv839x,1,"Amazon is planning to lay off approximately 10,000 employees in corporate and technology roles beginning this week, according to a report from The New York Times.

Shares of Amazon were down about 2.5% on Monday.

The cuts would be the largest in the company’s history and would primarily impact Amazon’s devices organization, retail division and human resources, according to the report. The reported layoffs would represent less than 1% of Amazon’s global workforce and 3% of its corporate employees.

The report follows headcount reductions at other tech firms. Meta announced last week that it’s laying off more than 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, and Twitter laid off approximately half its workforce in the days following Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of the company.

Amazon reported 798,000 employees at the end of 2019 but had 1.6 million full- and part-time employees as of Dec. 31, 2021, a 102% increase. The New York Times said the total number of layoffs “remains fluid” and could change.

A representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The holiday shopping season is critical for Amazon, and usually, one where the company has increased its headcount to meet demand. But Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO in July 2021, has been in cost-cutting mode to preserve cash as the company confronts slowing sales and a gloomy global economy.

The company has already announced plans to freeze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business. In recent months, Amazon shut down its telehealth service, discontinued a quirky, video-calling projector for kids, closed all but one of its U.S. call centers, axed its roving delivery robot, shuttered underperforming brick-and-mortar chains, and is closing, canceling or delaying some new warehouse locations.

Amazon reported disappointing third-quarter earnings in October that spooked investors and caused shares to sink more than 13%. It marked the first time Amazon’s market cap fell below $1 trillion since April 2020, and the report was the second time this year that Amazon’s results have been enough to spark a double-digit percentage sell-off. The sell-off continued for days after the report and erased almost all of the stock’s pandemic surge.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the change in the selling price of goods and services sold by producers. The PPI measures price change from the perspective of the seller. When producers pay more for goods and services, they are more likely to pass the higher costs to the consumer, so PPI is thought to be a leading indicator of consumer inflation.

I was thinking that it might be a good time to start looking for opportunities in the market. I see you guys posting some serious gains a lot of the time and wanted to know what everyone thinks. I was reading an article this morning about META being at a historically low price in terms of value. I just want to know, do you guys think its time to start looking to deploy capital into some of these great stocks that are down 80-90%? Or do you think that things will keep on falling. 

I'm making this post to try and have a ""civil"" discussion on where we think the overall market is headed in the near term. Lets say one years time. Is it too early to start looking for these potential great opportunities in the market or is the time now. I know last week the inflation report came out lower then expected, but Its still very high compared to the historic average. That got me wondering if it was just a rally because we havent seen any form of good news in so long that even half good half bad news is enough to cause a significant rally? Anyways when im talking about opportunities, im referring to stuff like they outlined in this article I read this morning, basically it was showing that some stocks are at ridiculously low levels compared to value. The example used was META, its trading at the same price as in 2015 but now its doing $27B in revenue compared to $4B and the EPS in like 5X or 6X higher.

SPY

SPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday’s low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday’s low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.

QQQ

QQQ held Tuesday’s low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.

DIA also held Tuesday’s low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA’s weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders’ attitude towards the market.

The financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.

XLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium.

337,1668068021,yr90ly,1,"Here is the full text of the letter Meta Platforms Inc. (Nasdaq:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent to employees Wednesday:

&amp;#x200B;

Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history. I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.

I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.

How did we get here?

At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I’d expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.

In this new environment, we need to become more capital efficient. We’ve shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas — like our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse. We’ve cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We’re restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won’t bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I’ve also made the hard decision to let people go.

How will this work?

There is no good way to do a layoff, but we hope to get all the relevant information to you as quickly as possible and then do whatever we can to support you through this.

Everyone will get an email soon letting you know what this layoff means for you. After that, every affected employee will have the opportunity to speak with someone to get their questions answered and join information sessions.

Some of the details in the US include:

\* Severance. We will pay 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap.

\* PTO. We’ll pay for all remaining PTO time.

\* RSU vesting. Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022 vesting.

\* Health insurance. We’ll cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months.

\* Career services. We’ll provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.

\* Immigration support. I know this is especially difficult if you’re here on a visa. There’s a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need. 

Outside the US, support will be similar, and we’ll follow up soon with separate processes that take into account local employment laws.

We made the decision to remove access to most Meta systems for people leaving today given the amount of access to sensitive information. But we’re keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell.

While we’re making reductions in every organization across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs, some teams will be affected more than others. Recruiting will be disproportionately affected since we’re planning to hire fewer people next year. We’re also restructuring our business teams more substantially. This is not a reflection of the great work these groups have done, but what we need going forward. The leaders of each group will schedule time to discuss what this means for your team over the next couple of days.

&amp;#x200B;

The teammates who will be leaving us are talented and passionate, and have made an important impact on our company and community. Each of you have helped make Meta a success, and I’m grateful for it. I’m sure you’ll go on to do great work at other places.

What other changes are we making?

I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate. For example, as we shrink our real estate footprint, we’re transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office. We’ll roll out more cost-cutting changes like this in the coming months. 

We’re also extending our hiring freeze through Q1 with a small number of exceptions. I’m going to watch our business performance, operational efficiency, and other macroeconomic factors to determine whether and how much we should resume hiring at that point. This will give us the ability to control our cost structure in the event of a continued economic downturn. It will also put us on a path to achieve a more efficient cost structure than we outlined to investors recently.

I’m currently in the middle of a thorough review of our infrastructure spending. As we build our AI infrastructure, we’re focused on becoming even more efficient with our capacity. Our infrastructure will continue to be an important advantage for Meta, and I believe we can achieve this while spending less.

Fundamentally, we’re making all these changes for two reasons: our revenue outlook is lower than we expected at the beginning of this year, and we want to make sure we’re operating efficiently across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs. 

How do we move forward?

This is a sad moment, and there’s no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you’ve put into this place. We would not be where we are today without your hard work, and I’m grateful for your contributions.

&amp;#x200B;

To those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. Not only are we saying goodbye to people we’ve worked closely with, but many of you also feel uncertainty about the future. I want you to know that we’re making these decisions to make sure our future is strong.

I believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today. Billions of people use our services to connect, and our communities keep growing. Our core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we’re leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform. We do historically important work. I’m confident that if we work efficiently, we’ll come out of this downturn stronger and more resilient than ever.

We’ll share more on how we’ll operate as a streamlined organization to achieve our priorities in the weeks ahead. For now, I’ll say one more time how thankful I am to those of you who are leaving for everything you’ve done to advance our mission.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p3p3o5ouvzy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ab7689530bb557aef5035d3c01549d12acad2c8

Here is my forecast based on historical CPI data and analysis. There is a chance based on Cleveland fed all miss besides CPI Yoy though. It will be a very spicy open. But something interesting to keep in mind is that this is the reddest pre-CPI day we have had since June. And for those of you who remember pretty much before July we used to get an almost standard and expected 2% intraday sell off on SPY the day before CPI… it appears we just started that trend again. Tomorrow will be interesting to watch. 

Will keep todays TA brief as we will have a massive move either way and the dust will settle and we can decide where we could be headed next. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zga5b13vvzy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96386cc3861d45a5883f81dc7af19dd9471bd9f4

We did break through that 378 key level support which has held up and we also broke through the rising wedge on the daily that we have been trading within since the last CPI. Based on my calculations bull case puts SPY somewhere between 385.3 to 389.1 tomorrow and bear case puts us near 362.9 to 359.2. 

Key daily supports around this range is 365 -&gt; 360 

Key daily resistance around this range is 384 -&gt; 388.6

Regardless of what reading is we are about to see the next big move and direction for markets. If CPI beats and JPOW truly can say next meeting that “inflation has slowed” and “we see reason finally to slow rate hikes” then we are going to see a push toward 400-420 by next CPI and FOMC (December 12/13th). However, if CPI misses (especially core and or MoM) then what JPOW said about not having inflation tamed and that it is pre-mature to even consider slowing hikes right now is about to be sang on every new outlet. If we miss I think we head down towards 320-340 before the next CPI/ FOMC in December.

Apple just closed below its last CPI candle body low of 134.9. Today tech as a whole (besides meta) looked probably the worst it has looked In a very long time. This further tells me that a CPI miss is not price in and that tech especially will get absolutely slaughtered. 

Looking at previous CPIs 5-6% movement is possible on Apple that gives us a possible 127.8 to 126.5 tomorrow which would be a new 52 week low for Apple… actually Apple right here is 4.4% from its 52 week low at close of market today. This is the first close below 138.4 support level since June of this year.

Zoomed out on tesla is beyond ugly and I feel like this thing is just going to get driven down until it closes under $100/ share. Currently 172.2 support is the 2022 bear channel on Tesla if that level breaks then there is just the massive weekly bear channel left as you can see. This also potentially will be the first close under the weekly 200ema since October 2019. 

Key supports- 167.6 -&gt; 150.9 -&gt; 129.3

Key resistance- 188.1 -&gt; 204.8

The VIX remains hella underwhelming putting in a mild 2.15% green day on the eve of CPI. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the VIX somewhere between 27 and 28.3 at open tomorrow and we could breach 30 if CPI misses that big. 

Daily log- 

Honestly I struggled today with the technical. A lot of oversold indicators then pushing $1-$2 through that level to then reverse then push further. I got stopped out a few times only for it to go green and I didn’t close green for it to reverse on me too. Overall ended green thanks to a few scalps but tough day for me. 

See what tomorrow brings with CPI.

***Respected Traders and Investors,***

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you are having a fantastic day. I wasn’t gonna post anything on Sunday but then i realized i have been slacking a lot recently. So today I am gonna bore y’all guys again with another one of my newsletter. It’s highly recommended you read this letter while you’re sober. Now wherever you read it, that’s not my place to say. You can read it in a stripclub or the toilet seat in a bar. I don’t mind at all but what I do mind is you read it, throw it away, forget about it and then later rekt yourself in a trade and then cry about how the market is manipulated and start blaming the people who fed you the narrative be it on Main-Street or Wall Street media. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Remember it’s always advisable to “Do your own research” “This is not financial advice”. So if you rekt yourself it’s your fault not anyone else.*

&amp;#x200B;

So today we are gonna talk about and not only just talk we are gonna visualize the past Santa Claus rally coinciding with the midterms election rally and draw meaningful conclusions from it. This post shall be based on manual interpretation and then finally we are gonna use the analysis what we have drawn to check whether it fits our theory called “The Great Financial Crisis in 99 days” For those who don’t know we released our most anticipated newsletter in a very long while. But unfortunately due to some technical issues with the Turing bot the post cannot be seen on Wsb. So you are advisable to go check my pinned tweet or you can hop on discord to get the letter. It’s completely free of charge but you have to work for it. I’m not gonna share the link here because some of you may find it inappropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

Without any further delay let us begin and dive into the visual analysis. An analysis you might have rarely seen on Wall Street.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Mid term x Santa Claus Analysis***

&amp;#x200B;

**Hypothesis :** 

\- Since we are in a bear market then all the analysis should be taking into account a bear market.

\- We have taken into account that post midterms we are gonna crash till March 2023 so we are gonna look for till December end and the next yr end cases. I know it sounds confusing but you will see later on what I mean.

&amp;#x200B;

**Procedure :** 

We will be using the Dow Jones Industrial average since 1896 coz we are the only guys who do every analysis based on the past 120 yr. The vertical will be either in red ( Republicans Presidents ) , blue ( Democratic Presidents )  and gray ( Mid terms elections ). The gray line will have two variables i.e. H suggesting “House” and S suggesting “Senate”. + ve , -ve , = will be seats added, subtracted , or remained the same after election conclusion.

Note : I forgot to remove = later on. So it will be either = +ve or = -ve or = =.

We also have a 4 points table of Santa, Evil Santa giving info about period b/w mid terms and yr end. And then there is Dragon King and Bull Market giving us info about period after mid terms till next yr end.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experiment :**

1. 1896 - 1904 : 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmztjs8yxiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed1c1ce2799f71f90c2dc74493d6e36a12f9dd4

Since we know we are not in a bull market so it makes sense to take bear market analysis. As you can see this contradicts our theory and says it’s after Feb first week you start crashing that means Santa Claus rally is coming but you can also see the power was under Republicans and not Democrats.

**Result : Okay fine. Santa 1 , Evil Santa 0 , Dragon King : 1, Bull mkt : 0**   

&amp;#x200B;

2 ) 1904 - 1912 : 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vd19gvs4yiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f96549f294e37e930185102f8d299fe35e8b5b8

Look at these times. I wonder what was going on here that markets decided to for a lost decade. As you can see markets peaked in 1906 and then it was only until 1916 we went for a bull market. But we don’t care about the lost decade right now. All we care about is Santa. So as you can see our first condition i.e. be in a bear market is fulfilled. So we can do an analysis on this and observe with your own eyes that markets fell either -42% in next yr or just stagnated and went -14% by next yr. No Santa Claus rally here.

**Result : Santa 2, Evil Santa 1, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 0**

&amp;#x200B;

3) 1912 - 1920

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/koqvhaq8yiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1efc09817a2c7253227a5458468fcbf0f4afc9

“I hate you i don’t wanna be a bear. I wanna go long with Dems in town” This is the analysis you get after you studying this period. I mean look at that midterms. Even if Biden loses both houses or just one by a -ve seats then the stock market would absolutely rip apart every bear in town. This is the hopium my friend “Tom lee” is smoking. Plus you get the added benefits of being in ⅓ inflationary period of all time. But bears will be like “I wanna exclude the first case because of its bull market”. No we cannot, we were in a bear market but midterms got us out of the bear market. And in the other case, there is no Santa Claus rally but there is a 2023 rally we cannot ignore. Also this election was special because it was the first time since the civil war that Democrats had total control of both houses plus President Wilson became two time serving Democrat since Andrew Jackson in 1828 - 1836.

**Result : Santa 3, Evil Santa 2, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**

&amp;#x200B;

4) 1920 - 1932

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/avkvw9tdyiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1701543d422083b9791c1fc2406738bef17c9c76

Look guys, I respect both parties and I have to be neutral. So Republican Presidents were you all asleep during 1920-30. Some of the news guys over here on Wsb who do not know their history would be like hey i wanna see how high that chart went up. Respectfully to those people quit trading and investing. So enough bad jokes. Let’s do this analysis. We are gonna exclude this bull market. You all know why by now. As for bear markets it is what it is even though i don’t want to give a single points to Santa rally but i have to give at-least one. As for dragon king in 2023 it clearly deserves 2 pts.

**Result : Santa 4, Evil Santa 3, Dragon King 5, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**

&amp;#x200B;

5) 1932 - 1944

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wa080oipyiy91.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2477219fb481929d0ba78a54f5ffb890dfdc1587

The most loved Democratic President having total control of both houses did not have it easy where clowns at the Federal Reserve were running a freak show over 15 yrs of span. But i guess who can blame them when they had to face world war 2. Btw those who don’t know Ben Bernanke won the Nobel prize for understanding the great depression by making crayon drawings like me. Now since I made bears angry in my President Wilson analysis its time to make some bulls angry by calling the first midterms in the bull market. “No you cannot do that. That’s wrong we were in a bear market of depression” You see for me 1936 is the top that will be broken yrs later in the 1940’s decade. If i start taking the Great depression as peak my god we wouldn’t break even till 1954. So it does not make sense. That leaves us with two markets for midterms. The first one kinda fits our previous newsletter analysis where we do three touches and boom. So evil santa and dragon will receive the points here. As for the other depressing market it’s pretty obvious. Also key thing to note is half of inflationary ⅔ 1940-50 decade midterms was the driving force with Democratic president. I feel sad for Republicans being the most hated but they had it coming by sleeping on the wheels.

**Result : Santa 5, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 3. Hmm interesting everyone got a step up.**

&amp;#x200B;

6) 1944 - 1960

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zxuuwlyyiy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b29b9730bf68b5347c6c757a19164240c08ef2c3

This if you remember from last analysis is the second half of ⅔ inflationary period i.e. 1940-1950 high inflation. And then I have also added further mid terms. But to be honest I am just gonna  disregard them completely. I mean look at those raging bull markets in mid terms. I am seriously not gonna take the Post World War 2 boom market of 266% of 86 months into consideration engulfing two midterms and the last midterms coninciding b/w the Cold war bull market. Just not happening here. So that leaves us with this complicated puzzle of 1946-1948. We talked about this extensively in the last newsletter. Just look at the Democratic President stuck in a midterms where he will have -ve seats in both house and senate for sure. So I think even though this analysis is suggesting a Wyckoff accumulation beginning from the post midterms till the entire year 2023 with moves like up +14% then down -12% I believe first a -20% capitulation will come ( highlighted in yellow ) since three touches are complete. Seriously if you do your other macro analysis with your ML and AI algorithms you will always find yourself getting caught in this inflationary decade with high debt/gdp ratio. But since i have to adhere to the principles i constructed hence santa and bull market takes the point. Also no lower lows were formed.

**Result : Santa 6, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 4.**

&amp;#x200B;

7) 1960 - 1980

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2f9j03myyiy91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28599239b6be9e009eb06448bf0dac01a06e12c8

This is the most interesting mid term analysis I have come across. You can also call this 3/3 inflationary high decade. Anybody out there who calls the current market stagflation should do statistical analysis on this and other charts. It’s a slap on the face of everyone who compares 2022 with 1970’s stagflation. In every post midterms rally the market has already bottomed and it continues to go higher by the following year end. Santa Claus rally came in every single post midterms. I also did the average analysis for you guys coz i love you all so much. The answer is +21.66% by December end. And if you do oil and gold analysis the results are gonna be shocking. Btw for bears who are complaining no you cannot take that one or that one. Sorry guys i have to coz we were falling more than 25% in every two yrs creating multiple bear markets. As for why I took the first one. Did you forget about kick starting the bull markets part?

**Result : Santa 11, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 9.**

A freaking 5pt leap by the bull and Santa. Bears bend over now. Tbh guys now you are starting to see why the markets are holding too strong. I think they believe more in the post mid terms rally aka santa claus rally than they believe in Fed pivot. This is what must have caused such bullish returns on post mid terms statistical analysis which is being fed to us in the wall street media.

&amp;#x200B;

8 )  1980 - 1996

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ytt733j6ziy91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1248c7966db3df66f30dba953f76e8588a31c8e

Why was I with bears again? Lol. I mean look at those monstrous next year returns. I mean this is what you really call a booming economy. Joe beans i didn’t mean to offend you if you’re reading this. A monstrous 4pt leap again. Hmm i dont think so. Two of those are in the bull market. The 1990 ( kick started the bull mkt ) and 1994 are the only ones in -20% bear market. Now you’re starting to understand guys why the data is statistically favouring the bulls over bears. But I gotta roll with the analysis. Can’t make unnecessary changes. Sorry bears bend over again to bulls in front of these crazy returns.

Average return : +25.62% as opposed to +34.45% taking into account Aug 1987 (Those two overlapped returns )

**Result : Santa 13, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 11.**

Now you guys should understand how hard it is to actually be short in the market. Your thesis should be inch precise otherwise you will be caught up in bear hopium and totally forget about riding the bull market.

&amp;#x200B;

9) 1996 - 2012

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3u5o15j6ziy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3daf658f3b40170eb7776ff303a61296b7026c

Finally some slow down. Not your monstrous crazy return now from post midterms to next yr end. So you can clearly see two midterms are in the bull market. Remember this is Dow Jones so maybe for Nasdaq this wont hold true coz Nasdaq peaked in 2000 so it was at bear market in 2008 as well. But yk that in Great depression i cancelled out the high bubble part similarly i might have given a pass to dotcom peak as well. Since we know that we cannot take the bull market part so hence we will take bear market and in that one midterms had santa but other one did not. But still bulls get pts as mkt averaged +ve return yet again for next yr end. No points to dragon king in a long time. 

**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13.**

&amp;#x200B;

10) 2012 - 2022 part 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8jm7dzi6ziy91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29567d21788a581824dc125124bdb88858e97dcf

Channeling my inner bear : 

Market should fall by -89% in all indices. Seriously, I had enough. We had globalization because of Reganomics. Hence the market should go to Regan levels. I am just kidding guys. I thought I might find something useful by doing this analysis but instead I found hopium here. It’s hard to be a bear and if anyone on the Internet professes “it’s so easy to be bearish”  “ohh the market will fall -20% for sure” Tell these guys to show them their calculation otherwise everything is priced in. And if these guys cannot show their calculation they really don’t know anything about markets and hence i call them “Born out of dotcom bubble investors”

Oh i totally forgot gotta do these stupid analysis. So as you can see we have never been in a bear market coz we didnt went -20% in Dow Jones. We broke 2008 all time high just after my favorite president of the US got reelected. This 2022 perhaps will be in a long time where we fell more than -20% in Dow indices.

**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13. No points added.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion :**

As you can see Santa Claus rally is coming and we will have bull market returns by next yr end from current levels i.e. markets will be higher than $3700 SPX by December 31, 2023. Tbh i don’t believe in this but this was the analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Result :**

Just long guys. F these bears. They don’t know anything. Powell will pivot in December fomc 2022 -&gt; market will rip higher with 50bps till when powell keeps rate flat or starts cutting. Disinflation trade will come soon. Cpi makes LL stock mkt will make HH &amp; HL. Tbh i dont believe in this but this was the analysis result. I am not joining the Tom Lee camp period. You guys can join him. And if youre thinking of joining me, well think again about this analysis coz me and “Michael Burry “ will march to hell and has a probability of (6/19)\* 100% of winning. I think I have forgotten how to calculate probability.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw i totally forgot to solve

Q. Where are we in regards to this Mid terms X Santa X 2023?

Ans. Well for that. Lets take our first initial condition i.e. a bear market. Second condition would be a Democrats and third condition will be high inflation. These all high inflationary bear markets say we have bottomed and the only move is to the upside till Jan end 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***Final Thoughts***

Some of you might question if this guy is even human. Who does this kind of analysis rather just write some Python + ML code and then just extrapolate the data. You see guys first of all yes i am human but the thing is I haven’t talked to people like in ages. I just sit in my room and either talk to you or I am just watching an anime, tv show, movie, sports from all across the globe. In short you can say I don’t have a life. My souls are scattered over the Internet and soon it will be on Metaverse. Hence i am bullish on Meta i guess. I am also an old fashioned investor like Gann and Wyckoff who loves crayon drawings over the stock market. I can write code since I was a developer  but I like manual and visual calculations over coding. That goes for my technical analysis as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy your weekend guys. I hope you guys live your lives to the fullest.

Stay safe! Eat healthy and just keep having discussions with your friends and family.

**That’s all I have to say right now.**

***With lots of love***

**Thank you**

399,1667778783,yo6uyy,1,"Intro: The Trade Desk (TTD) is an American multinational technology company that specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users. All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.

1). Massive competition 

As stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.


2). The premium is too high

They have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can’t produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can’t produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.

3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads

We are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.
 
4). The guidance nail in the coffin

Guidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.

5). Bull thesis

This is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind 

7) TL;DR

$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.

8). Position.

I have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday. Yolo, food stamps or Ferraris lol.

I am sure we all heard of Jeremy from the YouTube channel “Financial Education” has now lost $3 million dollars so far this year.  Most of the losses came from his holdings in growth tech companies like many here.  But his losses are a bit more as he holds large positions in:

Tattoo Chef 

Meta

Honest company 

Corsair Gaming 

Jeremy is a great guy and done well over the years.  Recently he bought is dream home in Arizona and Las Vegas.  I remember years back he lost a lot on GoPro and said he would never invest in a unprofitable company, seems like he didn’t take his own advice.

Ok apes,

I want excuse me for my English but I'm an Italian APE.

I'm reading so much post that show how the people have no confidence in financial system. Yes we are year since Jan 2021 but we have to believe in our ""weapon"".

We have XXX AMC and (at least) the same number of APE's shares. On 21.11.22 will be the T+90. I'm not saying that we will see an epic run in this date. I trust in Adam Aron and he create APE to have a dilution to help him to pay the debts.

So we have a bomb of three digits potential at 1.5$ at the moment. It's the moment to BUY like 28Jan21 with GME in order to force all short sellers to close their positions. Remember what GME caused to Melvin Capital.

Look at the actual financial situation:

\- CS is in trouble and last week announced to the people to sell their AMC's shares.

\- AMZN, META and other blue chip stocks have bad earnings and hedge funds like Citadel are trying to find money to survive.

I think that there is so much disappointed people that saw their money decrease due to a fraud of Wall Street. I'm here to remind you this message:

I've been using equity Options for a couple years to boost yield. Not Robinhood, not even based on WSB, but legitimate income boosting from my own individual research. It started with simple covered Calls, and then I made a few quick bucks with cash-covered Puts. It was some of the easiest money I ever made.

Jim Cramer says that pigs get slaughtered. Unfortunately, I started getting piggish. Jim does have his moments from time to time.

I got a little looser with my Puts, by not having cash to cover in my brokerage account. I have the cash, but it's in Savings. I started making riskier Puts because they had nice premiums. Had to roll a few, even took a few debits, but was overall positive in taking free cash in exchange for a little risk.

My usual tactic was to watch for a symbol to lose 10-20% in a day, wait a day to stabilize, and then sell a Put for another 20% discount. And I'd get 5% annualized yield. They almost always expire harmlessly OTM. Money for nothing. Easy, right?

Some dipped too close for comfort, or even went ITM. No problem, I can roll. Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?

Well, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.

Rolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.

Please learn these lessons:

1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.
2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.
3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.
4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.
5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.
6. Don't be greedy.

Fortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.

**Zuck the cuck has majority of the companies vote so there's no way he'll leave the new project.**

And quite honestly I like the project, VR is awesome more immersive and funnier. There's games that are much better with VR than they were released, VR has a lot of momentum with younger generations you bunch of new boomers.

Yes it's expensive and can cause headaches but so did phones and computers in it's earlier stages some even till recently. And there's room for improvement in this technology

Listen, Zuck MIGHT be an absolute regard and Meta MIGHT be the downfall of his company, but I hardly believe that’s the case. Take VR-chat for example, I have seen lots of people compare meta with vr-chat pointing out that there already is an existing product that currently, beats meta in regards to graphics and so on. But meta was and isnt meant to be like vr-chat. Vr-chat didnt change gaming or gaming trends in basically any shape or form. We still use our systems and most of us would never switch to vr when we have pc and other standard gaming consoles. So why would meta try to create an already existing product, which has proven to not be very successfull? Well I think the answer is simple, they’re not doing that. The massive spending everyone is constantly reffering to is obviously not spent on the graphics or how it ”looks”, but the engine and the software, that currently (as shown by vr-chat), is very underdeveloped. The product isnt and was never meant to be operational or used right now, but everyone seems to think that because of the massive spending, bad graphics and an unfinished product, meta is DOOMED. I believe that there is profound potential in the metaverse because of the massive spendings, not the other way around. People want groundbreaking technology that potentially could represent reality, but act suprised when it turns out the cost of such a system to be built, is massive. Regarded sheep mindset.

* The comments do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.
* The Treasury and Justice Departments are the ones leading a review and negotiations with the company.

Shares of U.S. social media companies Snap and Meta spiked on the news that a Federal Communications Commissioner said the U.S. government should ban TikTok.

“I don’t believe there is a path forward for anything other than a ban,” Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr told Axios in an interview.

Snap shares were up 6% and Meta shares were up 4% Tuesday afternoon.

The comments from Carr, one of four current commissioners at the Democrat-led agency, do not necessarily signal any pending actions against TikTok.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) in the Treasury Department is reviewing the company’s potential national security implications, given its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And the Department of Justice is the one leading negotiations over a security deal, The New York Times reported in September.

Concerns over TikTok’s potential security risks are generally bipartisan. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have expressed concerns and reviewed the company’s relationship with its Chinese owner. TikTok has maintained that it stores U.S. user data outside of China so that it would not have to turn over that information to the government, but U.S. officials have maintained their skepticism.

“Commissioner Carr has no role in the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to TikTok and appears to be expressing views independent of his role as an FCC commissioner,” a TikTok spokesperson said a statement.

470,1667322045,yje80q,1,"Some of Meta’s biggest shareholders have lined up to vent their anger at the social media company’s management after it stunned Wall Street with plans to ramp up its lossmaking effort to build the metaverse.

Even after a slide that has wiped 74 per cent from Meta’s stock price in little over a year, however, investors and boardroom experts said there was little outsiders could do to prevent chief executive Mark Zuckerberg using his majority control to plough ahead with a bet that has lost the confidence of Wall Street.

Meta’s shares tumbled 25 per cent on Thursday after the company revealed that losses from Reality Labs, its division that is building the metaverse, would grow “significantly” in 2023, after reaching $9.4bn in the first nine months of this year. Investors were also startled by another jump in capital spending that Meta said would consume as much as $39bn next year, more than double the level of 2021.

“If any other company had done this you’d have activist investors writing letters, proposing alternative slates of directors, demanding change,” said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer for US growth at AllianceBernstein, a Meta shareholder. “I think Mark heard crystal clear what investors wanted. He’s made his decision.”

The anger has spilled over into meetings with management, some of which Zuckerberg has attended personally since Meta shocked Wall Street with its spending plans late on Wednesday.

“It does seem like there’s a sense of frustration” among investors over the company’s ballooning costs, said one person familiar with the discussions.

Referring to the series of informal follow-up calls with investors after the company announced earnings late on Wednesday, Tierney said: “When people had callbacks with the company they got more disgusted, not less disgusted.”

“Zuckerberg was tone-deaf to the investment community, doubling down on everything,” said David Older, head of equities at €33.2bn asset manager Carmignac, which has holdings in Amazon, Microsoft and Google but not Meta. “The timeline for the metaverse is very stretched. I don’t think you’re going to know if it is the right move for five or 10 years.”

EQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the ""best"" among its peers heading into the winter this year.

As Europe’s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.

## 2. [General Motors (GM)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-GM/)

General Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.

I have plotted the last 9 periods (quarters) so you can see the trend and then we will compare with the chart of Meta share price where you will see clearly why/how the market is concerned. 

Take 1 minute to read properly and understand the trend:

[Yes, FCF my friends. The FCF!!!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/e8n65aywxsw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a4451bb8606c90e5ebc61359f7a8730f7234d7)

So what is the problem with the above chart?

The FCF has been ERASED! The only big tech that has decided to smash its cash flow generation capacity. Zuck doesn't care. He is all in into the METAVERSE. F\* you shareholders. Investment returns? You should have bought APPLE.

That's why you see the following QoQ share price action in the same period (I have plotted 99$ in Sep 30, but it should be 27 Oct):

But hold on, what is all that cash burn rate? What is Zuckerberg doing with our cash?

Well he anounced the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|In Billions $|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Expenses|86|100|

100 F\*ing Billion per year! Hey Regards, he could be buying your entire GME company 12 times each of these 2 years. 

But... was this a SHHURPRISE? Mmm... no! This is what he already anounced last year, and the stock did a rally from 320$ to the 340$ after releasing this:

&amp;#x200B;

[So still spending 10 Billiones below what he told us for FY2022](https://preview.redd.it/82o77zt30tw91.jpg?width=1560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97950cce7dfe04df98895f0b8e0ebf757d69e4ef)

The capital he will allocate in CAPEX will be 33-34 Bn$ each year, in 2022 and 2023. This is basically data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. As he says, ""increase in AI capacity""

So...

how is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.

The share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. 

OCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?

[Meta analysis 1](https://imgur.com/CRnf0I4)

Meta revenue came in -4.5% lower than the sept 2021 same quarter. As you can see, in 2021, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 64 cents was going to costs. In 2022, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 80 cents is going to cost. We're seeing a 45.66% decline in operating income. Also they are paying 21.18% in taxes which we will use later in our picture 4 calculation.

[Meta analysis 2](https://imgur.com/Qk325WQ)

In the 2021 quarter, eps came in at 3.22 and in the 2022 quarter, eps came in at 1.64. That is essentially a 49% drop. If we're looking at diluted shares outstanding, the number declined by 6% meaning they are outpacing stock based compensation with their buyback program. Their total share based comp expense has increased 31.74% which is understandable given they are growing a new revenue segment

[Meta Analysis 3](https://imgur.com/IUKfISN)

The information here shows the revenue segments and as we can see, from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter, reality labs revenue dropped by 48.92% and the family of apps revenue dropped by 3.6%. Given that reality labs is the segment they are pouring money into, this is highly unwelcoming news. This quarters loss on the reality labs segment also came in significantly higher and compared to 2021 quarter, was 39.57% higher.

[Meta Analysis 4](https://imgur.com/GAb3pG9)

Now if we remove reality labs, EPS would come in around 2.71 versus the 1.64 we got.  That is a 65.24% increase on EPS. Keep in mind that there are shared expenses and getting rid of a segment may not be as oversimplified as I have shown here.

564,1666926216,yfc0op,1," EU raises rates AND continues QE:

The euro tumbled below parity against the dollar on Thursday night after the European Central Bank (ECB) vowed to continue its money printing programme despite surging inflation.

The ECB increased interest rates by 0.75pc in an effort to limit sharply rising prices, with inflation hitting 9.9pc across the eurozone last month.

But it also said that it would continue the quantitative easing (QE) programme where new money is created to buy bonds.

The euro dropped around 1pc against the dollar to lows of $0.9976 on fears that inflation will remain higher for longer, with the rise in interest rates serving to make a looming recession worse.

Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, said: “Inflation remains far too high and will stay above the target for an extended period.”

The second straight 0.75-point rise in rates lifts the benchmark deposit rate to 1.5pc, bringing it to its highest level since early 2009. Inflation in the euro area reached 9.9pc in September, five times the ECB’s target.

The large increase in borrowing costs was already expected by markets. More surprisingly, the ECB announced it would only take very limited measures to start shrinking its €8.8 trillion (£7.6 trillion) balance sheet.

The ECB vowed to continue creating money by reinvesting the principal payments from maturing bonds bought in the aftermath of the eurozone crisis and during Covid.

Bonds bought in the years after the eurozone crisis would be reinvested for “as long as necessary”, it said. The ECB also extended the life of its Covid debt purchases “until at least the end of 2024”.

The cautious approach marks a divergence from the UK and the US. The Federal Reserve has already started to sell bonds back into the market, reversing QE, while the Bank of England will follow next week.

Unlike at the last rate announcement, Christine Lagarde was tight-lipped about how many more rate increases were yet to come and acknowledged that the economy was already showing signs of a downturn.

 She said: “Economic activity in the euro area is likely to have slowed significantly in the third quarter.""

While the central bank has moved more slowly than in the US and the UK, its decision to make borrowing more costly will prove unpopular in several eurozone countries.

Leaders in Italy, France and Finland have all expressed doubts about whether aggressive rate hikes are the right approach.

So last week I was up 4k on TSLA calls right before earnings held into after hours and lost a total of 18k. Had I sold before market closed I would have been up 4k. Then again this week had Intel puts for 24 and was up 3k going into earnings. Tomorrow I’ll lose majority of it unless something happens but my advice to anyone new playing options on earnings is to sell before market closes if the earnings report is after hours. You’ll make money regardless provided you bought a couple days before the earnings call leading up to the day before earnings. I made most of my losses on TSLA back from meta puts and yea I’ll lose my initial 1k in puts on Intel but will makeup for it on my other plays in GILD, Xom, and spy.

Which turned into a beyond choppy and untradeable day. I wasn’t able to really trade a lot today as I had to learn before 10am to go pick my kid up who had a fever and was puking and was in and out most of the day with her being home sick. 

After hours is looking brutal on SPY right now sitting down -1.2%. Havent seen that level of drop after hours in a long time!

Highlighted this yesterday on futures but im highlighting it today on SPY to make it even more clear. The blue arrows show what looks like a possible top on SPY which should lead to a sell off. I will be looking for an interaction with SPY at 378 support (now resistance after hours). This is the key level that separates the green and grey channels. A breakdown under this support and back into the green channel would signal to me a retest of 360s is coming before we reach 390 resistance. 

This will be the key pivot level to watch tomorrow. If we reject there in the morning or close back below that support of 378 (at this point we do have a gap to fill) then I will be looking for a further sell off next week leading into FOMC and with FOMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/siz07crkwew91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e192f0dd3fbbc96eb2a878a0d727f14768d0d3f3

I will touch on this more tomorrow in the weekly TA but overall SPY, Futures and Apple weekly charts are setting up for a massive failed breakout gravestone doji which should lead to a pretty nice sell off next week. The one caveat with this is that FOMC is next week and that can be a wild card for sure. If it wasn’t for FOMC id play puts for sure but I will sit cash most likely unless something looks really good. 

Key support- 378.8 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3 -&gt; 370.5

Key resistance- 380 -&gt; 383.1

&amp;#x200B;

If you read last nights TA I said that futes most likely would go up and touch 3870 before it rejected just like happened back first week of October. That would then lead to a sell off and we would see a further sell off intraday. Well with this drop after hours its setting up perfectly to see the next leg down leading into FOMC next week. 

With that 3870 rejection and now sitting back under key 3805 support I would look for the 3600s before I look for 3900 again. 

Key support -3770 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3675

Key resistance- 3805 -&gt; 3840

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 9720pjolwew91...*

Well there it is… Apple missed on pretty much everything but china rev lol. So that’s not very good.. currently only down 4% after hours though. The golden boy lives! The call will be interesting for sure especially since they never give guidance anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest though earnings is a whole none issue for me. Apple today broke through key red bull channel support. This is the same channel that SPY and Futures are holding so far. I will look regardless of what happens for further downside next week. This could be the fuel that markets need to see Apple retest its 52week low finally. If and when that happens I will believe that the temporary bottom is in. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 142.8 -&gt; 141.1

Key resistance- 148

And then there was tesla! So this is one that I am actually most excited about tomorrow at open. I think Tesla is poised for a really nice sell off tomorrow and next week. Tesla went on pretty much a 4 day bounce rally this week and established a super impressive rising wedge and bull channel. However, we say today that we broke out at open touching and rejecting key 234 resistance and then it dumped from there. If you caught that move it was one heck of nice win (granted not as nice as the call win yesterday). With this rising wedge broken I am looking to short tesla at open tomorrow most likely. I think if market remains are red as it is right now and Apple drops tomorrow and the rest of tech including SPY finally then we will see Tesla test that bull channel support. 

Tesla has established a really nice 230 to 205 consolidation channel. I am using the 230 area as a nice opportunity for puts and the 205 area for a nice opportunity for calls. 

Support- 219.2 -&gt; 215.6

Resistance- 225 -&gt; 230 -&gt; 234

Besides the VIX being detached from reality the one thing I am looking at is that we bounced off that previous support of 27 today and closed with a dragonfly doji. This should result in a nice retracement tomorrow which should also result in a nice dump of SPY tomorrow. 

10% challenge- 

Well after an all around fucky day… just found out my daughter who I had to go pick up this morning during opening hours actually has the VID… my son who I picked up from school at normal time walked out with an ice pack on his head cause he fell off the swing and probs has a concussion… our household be falling apart I tell ya. 

But I played Meta overnight for a decent win…

Intraday today didn’t get to play much. I ended up closing my level to level spy play EOD during PH cause I was supposed to leave to take my kid to the doctor… had I held that 1.6% win it would had hit 80% profits during that 15 minute drop after hours…

The analysts' rating of AAPL is trash. Only .58% returns in a year? What a rookie! Taking a deeper dive into their ratings and predictions, most of these gards put buy ratings at the top of a spike and right before the gay bears came to town!

667,1666862344,yen8jc,1," After [$GOOG (Alphabet)](https://www.etoro.com/markets/goog) even [$META (Meta Platforms Inc)](https://www.etoro.com/markets/meta) releases yet another disappointing figure that shows a drop in profits equal to 52% compared to a year ago.

In after hours it even drops 20%, taking to the prices it traded in January 2016. According to data from GuruFocus, the company is considered significantly undervalued as can be seen from the graph below. 

In general, growth companies at this time suffer greatly from both a lack of liquidity and the fact that they are priced in relation to future cash flows. 

With bond yields skyrocketing, it's more profitable to pocket the coupon of a bond than invest in a stock that hardly pays dividends. On the macro front, GDP data will be released today: hopefully the umpteenth bad news is that the GDP is worse than expected to avoid further tightening by the FED. 90% of analysts expect a 75 basis point hike in rates at the next meeting

From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a “level to level” play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren’t stopping out too soon (this is why I didn’t chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key support- 381.6 -&gt; 378.9 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3

Key resistance- 385 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple…. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a little excerpt to kinda help explain it. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0bowchjn68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c39316cd1e6b2cdd678135245fa4cb5de0f3b7

You know those little maps that say “you are here” when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak… apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover… its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3770

Key resistance- 3875 -&gt; 3925

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khdd3q1o68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=294783afc532d3880c7fbea998d610a3294c2acc

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn’t very bullish… 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing… technically Tesla beat but missed revenue… its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before… But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don’t know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 145.5

Key resistance- 150.9 -&gt; 152.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today… So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -&gt; 214.4 -&gt; 209.9 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234

&amp;#x200B;

As if the VIX couldn’t become anymore detached from reality… we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers… however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That’s really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn’t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it’s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

As the world's largest digital advertising company in terms of market share, Google’s revenue and profits both fell short of expectations, underscoring how the macroeconomic slowdown has hit demand for digital advertising industry.

Google's shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading, dragging down shares of other tech giants with related advertising businesses. Meta, Amazon and Pinterest all fell more than 4%.

Broken down by business, revenue and profit from Google's services business -- its core advertising and search, Android and Chrome browsers, hardware, Google Maps, Google Pay, the Play app store and YouTube video platform -- were weaker than expected

Other Bets, the former tech innovation division that includes self-driving startup Waymo, AI DeepMind, smart healthcare Verily and others, also missed revenue estimates and lost more than expected, with only the cloud business beating both revenue and loss estimates in the third quarter.

Specifically, revenue from search and other related businesses was $39.54 billion, compared with $37.926 billion a year ago, below analysts' expectations of $40.87 billion. YouTube posted $7.071 billion in AD sales, below expectations of $7.47 billion and even lower than $7.205 billion in the same period last year.

Alphabet

shares dropped about 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for the third quarter and said it would significantly decrease headcount growth.

    Earnings per share (EPS): $1.06 vs. $1.25 expected, according to Refinitiv estimates.
    Revenue: $69.09 billion vs. $70.58 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates.
    YouTube advertising revenue: $7.07 billion vs $7.42 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.
    Google Cloud revenue: $6.9 billion vs $6.69 billion expected, according to StreetAccount estimates
    Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $11.83 vs $12.38 expected, according to StreetAccount estimates

Revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41% a year earlier as the company contends with a continued downdraft in online ad spending. Other than one period early in the pandemic, it’s the weakest period for growth since 2013.

YouTube ad revenue slid about 2% to $7.07 billion from $7.21 billion a year ago. Analysts were expecting an increase of about 3%. Alphabet reported overall advertising revenue of $54.48 billion during the quarter, up slightly from the prior year.

Philipp Schindler, chief business officer for Google, said the company saw a pullback in spend on search ads from certain areas such as insurance, loans, mortgage and cryptocurrencies.

The report marks an ominous start to Big Tech earnings week for investors focused on the digital ad market. Last week, Snap issued disappointing results and said it was unable to provide a forecast given the volatility in spending and concerns about the economy. Snap plummeted 28% on Friday following the numbers. Meta
is scheduled to report results on Wednesday, and analysts are expecting a second straight quarter of declining revenue.

Alphabet’s stock fell below $97 after hours. Its lowest close for the year was $95.65 on Sept. 30. Prior to the after-hours drop, Alphabet shares are down 28% over the past year, slightly underperforming the Nasdaq.

Meta shares fell 4% in extended trading on Tuesday after rallying 6% during the day.

Alphabet’s top executives referenced the challenges the company faces at the top of Tuesday’s earnings release. CEO Sundar Pichai said in the statement that the company is “sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities,” while Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said “we’re working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities.”

During the quarter, Google Cloud brought in $6.9 billion — more than analysts expected. That’s a notable increase from $5 billion the year prior. Losses in Google Cloud widened to $699 million from $644 million the year prior.

Pichai enacted some cost-cutting measures across the company, citing economic challenges, including a potential recession, soaring inflation, rising interest rates and tempered ad spending. In September, Pichai said he wanted to make the company 20% more efficient, which could include slashing jobs and product cuts.

Google also canceled the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and cut funding to its Area 120 in-house incubator. And last month, Google said it would be shuttering its digital gaming service Stadia.

The company said it has a total full-time worker headcount of 186,779 — up from 150,028 last year. Pichai said on Tuesday’s call that the fourth-quarter headcount additions will be “significantly lower” than the third quarter as the company becomes “focused on moderating operating expense growth.”

“Our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023,” Pichai said, reiterating comments from the second-quarter call. “Talent is the most precious resource,” he said.

Porat said that in the fourth quarter, “headcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3.”",Alphabet misses on earnings as YouTube shrinks; company will cut headcount growth by half in Q4,1.0,2022-10-26 08:14:06

Its Monday cocksuckers.. And lady cocksuckers. And boy do I have a spicy one for you today...   Lasers BITCH!
 
April 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB and all the hype of a potential MSFT buyout, we all know how that went, but fuck you that's not the point. Fast forward 18 months and it’s clear that the price action in April 2021 was just an amuse bouchée for what will happen next.

Developments since April 2021 include:
Mavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It’s getting worse by the week as daily we are seeing trading largely Algo driven as with a lot of the market, liquidity is drying up and shorts are passing blocks between themselves to drive the price down. Some wrinkle brains with actual knowledge of how the market works have counts in the range of 100million shares short total on MVIS, a big difference from the 24% currently reported. Average short volume for the past 30 days is a whopping 70.36% with off exchange volume for the past 30 days touching 34.08%. Given many stocks are highly shorted right now I don't want to hear any slabbering, I know this shit man, but with a product as delicious as MAVIN Dr just being trademarked, and the fact they provided the light engine which made the Hololens 2 possible, and lets face it, if MSFT are using MVIS for the Hololens 2 they sure as hell are using it for the IVAS which secured MSFT that ball tingling $22bili contract with the US military. This is a ticking time bomb ready to fuck any short brave enough to touch it. Hiya Kenny.
 
MVIS have a cash runway for 2 years. They have negligible debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. Which given the state of the world right now is a golden arrow in their quiver, many of these competitors aren't likely to make it to production without seriously diluting their shareholders... I'm looking at you Omer(INVZ CEO for those unaware) who on the 29th of September announced Mixed shelf registration for up to $200million... CEO claims they don't need it but have done so for ""good business practices"".... Check his twitter comments stating such. I call bullshit, enough said.

MVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. 
MVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an “OEM friendly” white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor. Which the company has filed trademark registration for on 10/11/2022 https://uspto.report/TM/97628161 notice the smaller form factor compared to the original postings on linkedIn 
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/microvision_autosens-automotivelidar-activity-6975685318729490432-Hy3B?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop

Now the company has stated the form factor will get smaller when ASIC is completed... Is this the final smaller form or will we see another size decrease... We can only speculate for now..

Mavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. This has been tested and demonstrated to Some OEM (it hasn't been declared who) in Germany where the company has Offices set up as of last year... Someone wants MVIS in Germany...

Mavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. 

Mavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.

Mavin is available to OEMs via the NVDA platform.
MVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&amp;A. Feeling like Pac-Man munching up these dots.. Nom, Nom, Nom. 

MVIS currently has 3 vacancies for ASIC design engineers https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/
To which the CEO Sumit Sharma stated last year that it is not cost effective to design an ASIC unless they have secured orders for 1.2-1.5 million units... What does that tell you???

Sumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! Listen. Some clampets out there are stating that such a certification is capable of being self-certed.. to which I respond... Why the delay then bitch??? Because just like everything in this shitshow of a world since Covid, THERE ARE DELAYS.

MVIS said in the Jan 2022 investor slides that they would be ready for partnerships this year. Now that Class 1 certification has been achieved, MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! To which Sample sales have already started and are being shipped off to the big knobs with fat ass check books as we speak...

5 Unit case - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/4.jpg
Talk about classy..

MVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July’s earnings call. Now they have the class 1 certification, those orders have been shipped. They quoted one OEM as saying “Mavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen”. Sumit’s character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. Now, when I say Sumit is a humble man I certainly believe that to be the case, he is an engineer, so he gets rightfully excited when talking about the product and what the company has achieved with such, and in my opinion has no need to be a boisterous character like we see in some of the competitors, *cough* Austin Russell *cough* which tells me a lot about the company and the product they are offering...
 
The MVIS executive bonus scheme was launched this summer and it rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36. Todays opening price was $3.49. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! The tiered executive bonus scheme is organised as such that management doesn't get awarded shares unless the share price reaches the thresholds and stays there for 20 days. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. This is the real deal, and will make you enough money to finally move your way up from sleeping at the bottom of your wife and her many boyfriends bed.   

Their investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market. 

They have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  

In January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That’s a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple deals are expected to be signed over the next 9-10 months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. 

In addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which as previously mentioned only exists because of MVIS tech! 

https://youtu.be/OmiQvjQuFqQ

Done so by a very fine Redditor who took it upon himself after countless hours or research following patents etc to prove once and for all that MVIS are the dogs balls and have the tech so well patented and perfected that the biggest, baddest tech companies in the world cannot make this tech as good as this for themselves. Hiya Meta and APPL. Now MSFT had MVIS by the balls when this deal was struck as the company could well have been facing bankruptcy if it wasn't for the savage group of investors who put so much into this company, they staved off the relentless shorting and helped bring about the savage short squeeze we seen in April 2021.... This company has made so many people life changing amounts of money... But guess what, they ain't fucking done yet. People still buying shares when its right for them as they know the life changing money they have already made will be made again...   

Many AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. 
Then factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, and no one is selling. We all know what we own. 
It’s going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price.  There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  it’s inevitable.

Oh yeah EC is this Thursday.. Not expecting any mind blowing or even significant revenue changes, anyone expecting such will be sorely disappointed, but that is not the point. The business updates and hearing the confidence in managements statements is enough to get you harder than a couple little blue boys and your Mrs standing with a big red dildo to fuck you harder than the market has this year.

Listen, I could post DD for days on this company but you degenerate fucks are probably only going to read the TLDR and tell me to ""short squeeze these nuts"" (Fuck you Automod) buy shares, LEAPs if you must, but do not play into the MMs hand by buying weeklies or I'm going to come fuck you myself.

TLDR; this is in my opinion the most highly researched company on the market, the DD is phenomenal, and the company has the meat to follow. They cannot make a move without retail hot on their tail... And management KNOW THIS... Fuck the shorts, lasers are the future and MVIS knows lasers better than anyone.  PEW PEW

P.s THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY, although, the fact it is so highly shorted is just some extra fuel for when a deal is announced i'm telling you now so you have a chance to get in not far off what has so far been the bottom... What happens between now and a deal being announced is anyone's guess, but this is a damn good place to join the roller-coaster.

Wall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market’s most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy’s health.

On the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) – which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index – will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.

A bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

 

Earnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.

For this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.

Earnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn’t leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla’s revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

 

On Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.

Strength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback’s 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.

That headwind is expected to show up in Amazon’s results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate’s revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that “foreign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs"" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.

  

For Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted “demand has held up better than expected in recent months.”

Meta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech’s 72-hour earnings rollout.

Other notable financial results on tap include the Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), General Electric ([GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE)), General Motors ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)), Ford Motor ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), Comcast ([CMCSA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)), Visa ([V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V)), Mastercard ([MA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA)), and Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM)), among others.

In economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings – which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER’s panel of economists must officially declare a recession.

Economic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

 

According to Pantheon Economics’ Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.

“But the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,” Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",Yahoo Finance Big Tech earnings and GDP data,1.0,2022-10-24 02:46:56

Economic Data

Tuesday:

The Commerce Department releases its report on August sales of new homes in the U.S. New-home sales fell 12.6% in July compared with June.

The Conference Board publishes its September consumer-confidence index, which measures U.S. attitudes toward jobs and the economy. Consumer confidence improved in August after falling for three consecutive months.

Wednesday

The National Association of Realtors reports the number of home sales based on contract signings in August. Pending home sales declined in July for the second consecutive month as high mortgage rates and elevated home prices diminished demand.

Thursday

The Commerce Department publishes a third estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product—a broad measure of the goods and services produced in an economy—after its second estimate showed that the decline in U.S. economic output during that time was less severe than initially estimated. The second estimate showed that the economy contracted at a 0.6% annual rate in the April-through-June period, a slower pace than the 0.9% decline initially estimated, driven in part by an upward revision of consumer spending.

China’s National Bureau of Statistics and S&amp;P Global release September surveys of purchasing managers about economic activity in China’s manufacturing sector. China’s agency also releases a separate survey measuring the country’s nonmanufacturing sector.

Friday

The European Union’s statistics agency releases September inflation figures for the 19-nation eurozone. The bloc’s consumer prices were 9.1% higher in August than the same month a year earlier, the fastest pace since records began in early 1997.

The University of Michigan publishes its final reading of consumer sentiment for September. Its initial estimate earlier in the month showed it had ticked up from August’s final reading.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Another day of big reversals on Wall Street, with stocks posting their best week since June after a treasury rout stalled. The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It’s important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It’s do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

789,1666228586,y8k6uk,1,"Need to see what the non-adjusted eps was, but based on what I can read so far, the following is true:

Tesla Q3 '22 EPS - $1.05

Tesla Q3 '21 EPS - $.48

Tesla TTM eps $3.33. At the current SP of $208 (after hours), that puts PE ratio at 62. Down almost 20 points from it's current PE due to earnings growth. 

Meta - Between Q3 '21 and Q2 '22, EPS have declined by 23%, with an even bigger decline YOY once their Q3 earnings come out.

Amazon - Q3 '21 eps were $0.31 and Q2 '22 eps were negative (-0.20). Maybe they'll get some support from Rivian SP going up around 30% between beginning Q3 and end of Q3, but their operating margins are still lousy in this inflationary environment. They're up against a tough comparison for Q3 '21 so their TTM EPS will likely further decrease, pushing up their PE ratio and putting pressure on share price.

Google - EPS have decreased from $1.40 in Q3 '21 to $1.20 for Q2 '22. We'll have to see what Q3 brings, but likely it'll be less than the $1.4 eps they made in Q3 '21.

Even apple is seeing eps decline. 

My only point is that we've been in an earnings recession within big tech (and tech in general) for the past several quarters. Tesla has been one of the few outliers. Their eps growth has been explosive, where everyone else has been declining. Living in the Bay Area it's pretty impressive seeing how many teslas are now on the road..and the rest of the country is seeming to follow suit.

KEY POINTS

* **Mark Zuckerberg fears people got too excited about the metaverse too quickly, considering it will take years to come to fruition.**
* **The stock looks cheap, but the company is spending billions to build out the metaverse.**
* **Meta Platforms could be a stock for some to buy, but any shareholder will need to patiently wait a decade or more to realize real metaverse returns.**

Summary

* The value destruction in META shares has been non-stop, with the narrative and price action being consistently bearish for months now.
* While often over/mis-quoted, we think the Buffettism regarding fear and greed is appropriate for META now. While the structural picture remains murky, better to be greedy than fearful here.
* Short-term, META struggles to monetize and grow engagement on Reels, while macro weighs on the general advertising climate. That said, we think there are some short-term catalysts for the stock.
* Bombed out earnings expectations coupled with midterms spend, improving targeting/attribution, clear strategic direction from new management, and better than feared engagement trends could propel the stock higher from here.",Due Diligence by Poppa Stacks - META - Incredibly Bullish Short-Midterm Volatility New Headset Dropped this Week.

* Internal documents show Meta's Horizon Worlds platform is struggling to retain users.
* Those who can afford the $400 pricetag report the metaverse has glitchy features and empty worlds.
* Most Metaverse users don't return to the Horizon Worlds platform after the first month.

Inside the Horizon Worlds platform, Meta is struggling to keep users engaged with glitchy features and empty worlds.

With a $400 pricetag to access the platform via the Quest 2 headset, the metaverse isn't yet accessible to the casual user. Those who do get a chance to try the tech experience baffling branded content, persistent bugs, and empty worlds with no user interactions. Even employees appear not to enjoy the platform, saying there is a ""quality"" problem.

Last month, in response to user complaints, Meta put the Horizon platform into ""lockdown"" — pausing the rollout of new features while it works to improve the user experience of existing elements in the virtual reality world, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Users have criticized the avatars' curious lack of legs as well as having few other users to interact with. Internal statistics, WSJ reported, indicate that only 9% of worlds built by users are ever visited by at least 50 people, while most never receive any visits at all.

Some female users also report sexual harassment and digital groping, prompting Meta to institute a safety feature that creates a virtual 4-foot buffer around avatars on the platform. WSJ reported men outnumber women by two to one on the platform and that — while reporting — a WSJ staff member was asked to expose herself by a user she interacted with online.

Internal documents show Meta has fallen far short of its goals for regular monthly users, WSJ Journal reported. The company initially had set a goal of 500,00 monthly users by the end of 2022, but has changed that figure to 280,000. The documents show the platform has less than 200,000 current users. Most users generally don't return to the app after the first month, while more than half of Quest 2 headsets are out of use within six months WSJ reported.

The U.S. economy could be heading for a recession in the next year, according to growing warnings from banks and economists, as a sudden bout of pessimism hammers financial markets, which on Thursday spiraled further from recent highs.

Although major swaths of the economy — including the job market and consumer spending — remain robust, there are mounting worries that rising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, after years of near-zero interest rates, could cause a sudden retrenchment. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points so far this year, while officials are signaling more aggressive increases could be necessary to cool the economy. Continued uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are adding to the uneasiness.

Financial markets fell again on Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst drop of the year. The S&amp;P 500 inched further into bear market territory — defined as a 20 percent drop from the most recent peak — after Wednesday’s sell-off wiped out more than 4 percent of its value.

“Recession risks are high — uncomfortably high — and rising,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “For the economy to navigate through without suffering a downturn, we need some very deft policymaking from the Fed and a bit of luck.”

Nations move to tackle inflation, increasing risk to global economy

This week alone, former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein warned of a “very, very high risk” of recession; Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said there was “no question” that the U.S. economy is heading toward a downturn; and former Fed chair Ben Bernanke cautioned that the country could be poised for “stagflation” — a slowing economy combined with high inflation.

Those concerns come amid a smattering of data that points to economic cooling, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors that are already feeling the brunt of the Fed’s promise to keep tightening monetary conditions. New home construction slowed in April. Mortgage demand continues to decline.

Some of the country’s largest and most influential retailers reported disappointing sales and profits this week because of higher costs and overstocked inventory issues, engineered to avoid supply chain disruptions, setting off a stock market meltdown. Walmart stock plunged more than 11 percent on Tuesday, its worst one-day loss in 35 years. On Wednesday, Target shares tumbled 26 percent, following a stunning 52 percent drop in quarterly profits, which executives attributed in part to cooling demand for big-ticket items such as TVs, kitchen appliances and outdoor furniture.

Fed hikes rates by half a percentage point in fight against inflation

“While we anticipated a post-stimulus slowdown in these categories … we didn’t anticipate the magnitude of that shift,” Brian Cornell, Target’s chief executive, said in a Wednesday earnings call. “When we talk to our guests, they often express their concerns about a host of rapidly changing conditions, ranging from geopolitics to the high and persistent inflation they’ve been experiencing.”

Goldman Sachs this week revised down its forecast for second-quarter U.S. economic growth, to an annualized rate of 2.5 percent, citing higher prices and continued supply chain disruptions. That follows an unexpected contraction in the first three months of 2022, when the economy shrank at a 1.4 percent pace, mostly because of a trade imbalance and a drop in inventory purchases.

Economy shrinks 1.4% in first 3 months of year, raising recession fear

International turmoil, including a risk of recession in Europe and China, is dimming the outlook for the U.S. economy. And a strengthening U.S. dollar — as rate increases make dollar investments more attractive — could dampen exports, raising the chances of a technical recession in which the economy contracts for two quarters in a row.

That fear of a souring economy as well as shifts in consumer pandemic spending habits have led some highflying tech darlings including Netflix and Peloton to announce layoffs in recent weeks. Twitter and Meta have paused hiring plans, while Amazon executives recently said the company was “overstaffed” after months of brisk hiring. National claims for unemployment insurance inched up to 218,000 last week, a four-month high although still near historic lows.

Meanwhile, inflation, which remains near 40-year highs, has become a central challenge for both the economy and the Biden administration. Higher prices for basics like food, energy and housing are straining Americans’ budgets and clouding their view of the economy. Gas prices soared to yet another all-time high this week, with average prices hitting $4.57 per gallon nationwide. A closely watched consumer sentiment index by the University of Michigan shows that Americans’ views of their current finances and future expectations have fallen sharply in the past year.

Despite that gloomy outlook, Americans continue to spend heartily. Sales of clothing, cars and furniture all ticked up in April, contributing to a 0.9 percent increase in overall retail sales from a month earlier, according to Commerce Department data released this week.

“Near term, the U.S. economy is holding up rather well despite the trouble abroad and the high prices at the checkout stand,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist for S&amp;P Global, who says there’s a 35 percent risk of recession in the next year. “People are spending, businesses are still trying to hire. But there are certainly challenges ahead. The Fed’s actions will slow the economy, but the question is whether they could also topple the apple cart.”

A day after warning that slower growth and inflation are “having stagflationary effects,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said Thursday she is optimistic the central bank could contain inflation without causing a recession. But she acknowledged that the ability to do so was far from clear.

“I think it’s conceivable there could be a soft landing. It requires both skill and luck … I hope that’s the case, but this is a very difficult economic situation,” Yellen told reporters in Germany, citing economic shocks from the war and sanctions on Russia. “There’s a lot going on. … It’s not a straightforward matter.”

Even if the United States staves off a recession in the short term, some economists say the sheer pace of inflation, with prices up 8.3 percent in the past year, and the persistent supply-and-demand imbalances caused by the pandemic, and the policy responses to it, could snowball into an even more severe crisis down the line.

“Consumers are spending like crazy, businesses are going to need to rebuild their inventories, and a lot of workers are still flowing back into the labor market,” said Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University who served as an adviser during the Obama administration. “But all of this makes me worry about one or two or three years from now — because it might mean the Fed needs to raise rates even more, and it might mean you create an even bigger recession later.”

Zandi, of Moody’s, said rising gas and commodity prices from pandemic-related supply chain snarls and the conflict in Ukraine have added to the specter of an economic downturn. He now puts the odds of a U.S. recession in the next 24 months at about 50 percent.

“We’re traveling very close to the edge,” he said. “The housing market is the next thing that’s going to roll over; the question is just how hard.”

New home construction fell in April, led by a slowdown in single-family homes. Building permits, which offer a glimpse into future construction, also declined, according to data released this week by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

“Home builder sentiment fell to the lowest level in two years in May,” Yelena Maleyev, an economist for Grant Thornton, said in an analyst note. “Builders are seeing less foot traffic and expect sales to be softer as we enter the busy home-buying season.”

Mortgage rates are rising, but the hot housing market is slow to cool

That softening is already rippling through the economy. Major mortgage lenders across the country, including Wells Fargo and Better.com, have laid off thousands in recent weeks as a result of dwindling demand for home loans and refinancing.

In Alexandria, Va., mortgage lender Kevin Retcher said there is a discernible skittishness among potential home buyers. Refinances began tumbling late last year, around the time the Fed began signaling upcoming rate increases. In the months since, a combination of rising mortgage rates — now at 5.3 percent for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage, nearly double early 2021 levels — and sky-high home prices have begun deterring buyers, he said. At least three clients have gotten “cold feet” and pulled out of ratified contracts in the past two weeks, he added.

“There is an extreme sense of nervousness out there,” said Retcher, president of First Meridian Mortgage. “It’s rare to have people win contracts and then back out, but that’s what’s been happening.”

Other types of small businesses say they’re seeing a pullback in consumer demand, too, as customers grapple with rising costs. Aaron Mulherin, who owns a glass repair company in Marion, Iowa, said that while homeowners are continuing to pay for necessities such as fixing broken windows, they’re starting to think twice about spending on luxuries such as custom showers.

“Average, middle-class consumers are starting to hesitate,” Mulherin said. “Everything is getting more expensive, so they’re getting an estimate, then putting it off.”","U.S. may be barreling toward recession in next year, more experts say ‘Recession risks are high — uncomfortably high — and rising,’ a leading economist says",1.0,2022-10-17 06:34:19

From a fundamental analysis looks like the company its been highly undervalued. Even tho the user per revenue was not the expected, they have been buying back their shares, and their numbers (net income growth, long-term debt, cashflow, etc) are quite good. 

From a technical point of view, I believe it could still reach its lowest point at 123p as it has broken the 150p support. 

My strategy would be waiting until it goes up and breaks the 150p resistance to invest and then keep an eye on and see what happens when it reaches the 38.2% of fib. 

I know for fact there’s plenty of highly prepared people in this community much more knowledgeable than me. I would love to hear your thoughts on the Stock itself and your strategies around it. 

Thanks! 🙂",Meta discussion,1.0,2022-10-09 10:57:02

* **One memo said the team building the metaverse app doesn't spend enough time using it, The Verge reports.**
* **Updates to the metaverse app are scheduled to be shared on October 11 at Meta's Connect conference.**

Internal memos from Meta's VP of Metaverse to employees working on the metaverse app highlight concerns that it has too many quality and performance issues — and that even employees don't seem very engaged with it.

The memos, obtained by The Verge's Alex Heath, are written by Metaverse VP Vishal Shah. In them, he tells the team they will be in ""quality lockdown"" for the rest of the year so the issues can be fixed before more users get access to the app.

The app, called Horizon Worlds, was released on Meta's Quest headset last December and is expected to have a mobile and desktop web version soon. The app lets people build avatars and interact with each other in a virtual reality world. **In a shareholders meeting in May, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg** **told shareholders** **the company's metaverse project is expected to lose ""significant"" amounts of money for the next three to five years.**

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE JUST MY PLAN EXPLAINNED IN DETAIL

As of 25/9/22 meta trades at about 140 I (and a lot of analysts) belive it is highly undervalued. This means in a simple sense Wallstreet Expects about a 45% increase by 2023 September But a call(ATM OR ITM BY ABOUT 5%) is only 3-4k assuming said call has a 80 delta and the stock does infact go up like analysts predict at about 215$ (I Know the math doesn't exactly add up but different funds have different estimates both are an average)
Your call Increases by about 6000+(Depending where meta lands exactly)in value BUT here comes the special part you are also gonna go Theta gang while your LEAPS is in the background and sell PMCC's I recommend a 50 delta gap between your PMCC and your LEAPS. If this is executed correctly a 3000 initial investment could end up at about 11000+ In total a 366%+ Gain So buy your LEAPS while they're cheap and get ready for tendies

865,1664050647,xn2wn6,1,"The market is retesting the lows (SPY 362.17), expect a bounce of some kind. Might be for an hour, a day, or a week, but a bounce is coming. 

**Why would the market bounce?** 

* Markets don't move in a straight line, we have been going straight down since the Fed meeting 
* Shorts are going to cover (if they didn't already in the last hour on Friday)
* People who bought puts in the last 3 days since Powells speech are going to close them for gains now that they got the down move and VIX is elevated 
* When people close out long puts, VIX comes down
* 3 day rule applies: the third day after the Fed meeting is Monday 9-26
* People say ""the market doesn't bottom on a Friday"" so expect another gap down at open or the June 17th lows to be tested early in the AM 
   * The dumb retail traders who are late will read the news over the weekend, and the fear sets in, so they sell on Monday (in theory)
* In the last hour of the day expect a rally as shorts cover and figure that the down move is at least over for now 
   * ""They"" are going to want to sell their puts while VIX is still high - or close their equity shorts before the other guy does 
   * Once one short covers, another short is going to want to cover as well before their gains are wiped out
   * We all know what a short squeeze is, right?
* Markets hate uncertainty, but the big event (Fed speech) is over now
   * Uncertainty has been reduced 
   * All the other central banks just finished a global coordinated rate hike - that is behind us now 
* No more Fed meetings until Nov 3rd. Pow has been hawkish 3 times in a row now, ""rumor"" is he has to be more dovish next time right? Aren't we feeling the pain now? 
   * Buy the rumor they say 
* Oil died so that feeds into the ""inflation is coming down narrative"" 
* The last CPI was a surprise because people were expecting a ""better"" number
   * Now everyone is scared and is expecting a ""worse"" number so any data that comes in not as bad as expected, will send the markets higher 
* Rates on the 2yr and 10yr have been on a straight up rally, so it is more likely they ""revert"" than continue (at least in the short term) 
* At some point the cash sitting on the sidelines comes back into the market 
   * Remember everyone that sold the last few days? They didn't buy bonds (check the rates), they didn't buy gold, they didn't really buy ""safe"" stocks either - they went to cash and they bought puts. Cash gets spent and puts get closed

**Look at this primitive cave painting I have prepared for you:**

*Processing img g26q3sdx1vp91...*

* Whenever RSI gets to these levels (orange circles), we get a major bounce
* The next trading range:
   * Spy 360 seems to be level we were fighting over in the past (red dashed line)
   * SPY 340 was peak before COVID (blue dashed line)
   * SPY 320 is the bottom of the level we were fighting over in the past (green dashed line) 
* The bear market range:
   * Red line = top of the range, good place to be selling 
   * Green line = bottom of the range, good place to be buying (or at least not selling) 

**Could we go lower?**

* The chart looks terrible, and all signs point to continued downside moves. 
* There is no ""macro"" reason why the selling would stop 
* The market hasn't completely priced in the current interest rate levels 
* The bond market doesn't seem to believe the Fed's projected terminal interest rate. Either the fed or the bond market will be wrong and change their opinion 
* Powell is in the bond market daily unwinding the balance sheet, that pushes up rates, and requires stock earnings to be further discounted 
* More companies could pre-announce downside revisions to earnings - FEDEX and Ford sent the market lower and more downside revisions are probably coming 
* Russia could use nukes 
* Natural disasters, food shortages and other macro issues continue to deteriorate and that will cause commodities to be in short supply, that means prices going up, which means inflation is going to go up 
* The dollar is strong and shows no signs of slowing down 
* Financial conditions are tightening and money supply is coming down - assets can't go up if money itself is going down 

**What should you do?**

* Don't buy calls: If you buy calls, and VIX comes down, you are not going to see the gains you expect, even if the market moves up. 
   * You will win on delta, lose on vega, lose on theta 
* Do sell puts: If you sell puts you get to win on three greeks: 
   * you win on delta, win on vega, win on theta 
   * give yourself 2 weeks of time to realize this bounce because it might not start for a few days if it doesn't start on Monday 
* If you like shares, then consider the tripple leveraged ETFs for a short term trade 
   * If you are capable of thinking past this week, get long on growth equities, but only get companies you can see being around still in 2 years (SHOP, NFLX, META)

I won't bore you with actual data, but their P.E ratio indicates they are extremely undervalued. 1.5BILLIONS revenue in 2021. Free cashflow of Around 350m cashflow with a marketcap of 900m. Dividend is almost 1.25 per share annually. Hyper growth with good dividend stonks. I'll stop here if you like this type of crap talk about numbers you probably ain't gonna ape like a regard.

Back to the real DD. So we all know that most taiwan stonks are being hammered due to political tensions wtih China, and also inflation. 

On the China front, this is Taiwan, and HIMX's tech has become pretty integrated with most automobile and average household items like smart fridges and automobiles and nobody knows due to NDA NDA NDA. Taiwan and the West both play fair and respect IP, and HIMX has over 3000 patents. All three major companys like META, APPLE, MSFT, AND GOOGLE, SAMSUNG, VALVE, are creating AR/VR tech, and HIMX's ceo has been betting on this since 2015, with more emphasis on AUTOs and smart household items, which we are seeing a huge amount of shortages of. SO?? This means an American company will probably acquire it soon. 

INFLATION: When inflation starts investors tend to move away from growth stocks and put their money in safe havens. well HIMX is a pretty good safe haven, 5$ per share you get 1.25$ of divy per year. If it keeps dropping to 3$ they'll be the most undervalued stock in the history of the stock market if they happens I'll personally go down to wall street and pull the race card, this is unacceptable.

892,1662398897,x6lyop,1,"A fat fine — of $402 million — is headed Instagram’s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children’s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Meta was contacted for comment on the penalty.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram’s parent, Friday — ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company’s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities — however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland’s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.”

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) — following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR’s transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform’s processing of children’s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally — as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn’t leak early).

While today’s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it’s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children’s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it’s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland’s draft decision — triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland’s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft — and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

To prevent serotonergic toxicity and other negative interactions, however, patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or other antidepressants will need two to four weeks to wean from other medications.

To treat MDD, conventional pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can take months of dose calibration, with efficacy varying significantly from patient to patient.[\[43\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft43) This approach is cost-effective for depression of moderate severity. As depression becomes more severe, conventional treatments like SSRIs are much less cost-effective.[\[44\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft44) To highlight the problem, the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that only 20% of patients treated for MDD respond partially without remission, while 50% do not respond at all.[\[45\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft45) One study found that 55% of MDD patients discontinued treatment after five months.[\[46\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft46) Because healthcare payers are more likely to cover––and patients are more likely to adhere to––medications with higher efficacy, ARK expects psychedelic therapies to accrue significant value.

In our view, one of the most important factors limiting the sales of psychedelics is that they require physician supervision. To estimate the pricing and costs of Psilocybin under current regulations, consider the economics of Esketamine (Spravato). Esketamine (also called S-Ketamine), is the S-[enantiomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer) of the drug Ketamine. Since the 1960s, Ketamine has been used or abused as an anesthetic and tranquilizer. Ketamine elicits euphoric, dissociative, and amnesiogenic effects that have made it a popular street drug. Esketamine is Johnson &amp; Johnson’s attempt to repurpose Ketamine for the treatment of MDD and TRD. While not a psychedelic, Ketamine typically is administered at specialized treatment centers and requires two hours of supervision after dosing. Due to its roughly two-week durability, one year of Esketamine treatment can consist of twenty or more administration sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

According to early clinical evidence[\[47\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft47),[\[48\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft48) Psilocybin is more efficient and effective in the treatment of moderate to severe depression due to its annual or biannual administration schedule and lower relapse frequency. The chart below illustrates Psilocybin’s clear durability advantage. The one-year depression relapse rate associated with Psilocybin is roughly 2.5 times lower than Esketamine’s.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. Not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security. Note: These data were aggregated from multiple studies and may not be perfectly comparable due to differences in experimental methods. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was included as a non-pharmaceutical comparison. The 30-day relapse rate was used in the case of Esketamine due to low data availability on Esketamine one-year relapse rates. The end of the bar represents the median value of observations contained in selected metanalyses, and error bars represent minimum and maximum reported values.\[47,49-51\]

In clinical trials, the response rate to Psilocybin has been 5-10 percentage points higher than the response to Esketamine. Based on “cost per depression free day” (DFD), if the cost of administration––including physician supervision, support staff, testing––were to remain relatively fixed, we believe insurers are likely to be willing to pay $16,900 per dose of Psilocybin to achieve the same outcome as Esketamine, as shown in the scatter plot below. We assessed the response rate of different antidepressant therapies by dividing the number of improved patients in the treatment group by the number of improved patients in the control group. Based on this cost-benefit analysis, Psilocybin scored better than traditional antidepressants and Esketamine.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. Not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security. Note: While robust data are available for the cost ranges of SSRIs, TCAs, and Esketamine, the potential cost range of Psilocybin treatment is ARK’s estimate. Response rates for SSRIs and Esketamine were derived from systematic reviews. However, the putative response rate for Psilocybin was based on early clinical evidence of a relatively small sample size. Importantly, since this graph represents a meta-analysis, these numbers may not be comparable due to differences in experimental methods, dosing, and demographics between studies. The error bars represent high and low ranges found for annual direct costs (pharmacy, inpatient, and outpatient costs) and response rate. \[44,47,52,53\]

Consider the tables below, which represent comparison-based methods for estimating Psilocybin’s potential average wholesale price. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, we calculated the cost per depression-free day (DFD) by dividing the total direct costs per year (therapy/supervision and pharmacy costs) for each treatment option and adjusting that number based on the efficacy difference between the two methods as assessed by average response rate vs. placebo. Given the sums patients/insurers pay for Esketamine and conventional antidepressants, we believe that these tables suggest what payers are likely to be willing to pay per dose of Psilocybin.

Note: We calculated total direct costs per year for Esketamine and Psilocybin as the sum of the yearly drug and supervision costs. For antidepressants and talk therapy, we used published estimates of direct costs for major depressive disorder.\[54\]

The other method we used, as shown below, provides the hypothetical price of Psilocybin when the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is fixed at roughly the midpoint between the other treatment options.

Given the current costs of administration associated with Esketamine, we believe payers would be justified in spending over $16,900 per dose on Psilocybin therapy. That price, however, reflects the inefficiencies of Esketamine’s business model better than it represents a good estimation of Psilocybin’s price at launch. A price of $4,300 per dose, or $8,600 per year, for Psilocybin not only would bring the cost per depression-free day down to $62, but would also bring the cost/QALY to $100,000, which meets an important willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold for many international markets. It also represents a rough midpoint between Esketamine and conventional treatment methods using the cost/QALY comparison.

At $4,300 per dose, ARK estimates that Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy could reach nearly 7.5% of patients with TRD, leading to $1.4 billion in revenue at peak sales within ten years of commercialization. That could translate to a $5.5 billion-dollar, ten-year net present value for Psilocybin sales for treating MDD and TRD in the United States alone. Furthermore, the drug discovery phase typically has been estimated to account for roughly 30% of development costs.[\[57\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft57) If drug discovery is unnecessary for most psychedelic drugs, clear profit margin advantages are implied.

While the cost projections above may seem high, the data suggest that Psilocybin has advantages in durability, safety, and efficacy relative to other treatment options for patients with MDD. Moreover, Psilocybin has the potential to alleviate burdens associated with the direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system. The CDC estimates that depression is a major cause of productivity loss among working adults and comes at a cost of 200 million workdays lost per year.[\[58\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft58)

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. Not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security. Note: ARK built the projected pharmaceutical sales curve shown in the graph and table above by estimating the rate of psychiatrist adoption of Psilocybin. We derived data on the rates at which psychiatrists adopt new medicines from Huskamp et al. (2013), adjusted based on the published polling data that reflects psychiatrists’ attitudes toward psychedelic drugs, as reported in Corrigan et al. (2021). We also attenuated the data by estimating the lag time involved with training and infrastructure build-out, assuming that 25% of a psychiatrist’s average patient caseload suffers from moderate to severe depression, that 75% of those patients would not be eligible for Psilocybin due to one or more exclusion criteria, and that each potential patient would represent the yearly sale of 1.5 doses of Psilocybin at $4,300 per dose.\[59-61\]

In the sales curve above, we projected that Psilocybin sales could reach nearly $1.4 billion dollars per year at a price of $4,300 dollars per dose. However, this projection was made using conservative assumptions about patient eligibility and psychiatrist acceptance. The indication for which a drug is first approved often is narrower than its target population at a mature state. This is particularly true for criminalized drugs like Psilocybin, which, before receiving approval for at least one indication, must struggle with their Schedule I status. While $1.4 billion might be a reasonable sales estimate for Psilocybin as a treatment of TRD and more severe MDD, it seems possible that the uses of Psilocybin will expand to more moderate forms of depression as psychiatrists recognize its efficacy relative to SSRIs, which today represent a $15 billion dollar market in the United States. The clinical data suggest that Psilocybin is more effective, and scientists continue to reveal ways in which the neurophysiologies of many common mental health conditions overlap.

One example of this phenomenon was the rapid growth of Fluoxetine prescriptions to 35 million in the ten years after its approval in the United States––nearly doubling the prevalence of depression at that time. Suicide rates fell an from 12.5% to 11% during that timeframe, suggesting that psychiatrists were at least somewhat justified in their prolific use of Fluoxetine.[\[62\]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/psychedelic-therapeutics/#ft62) In the process, Fluoxetine caused a shift in prescription trends and the manner in which depression is treated. If Psilocybin were to reach a similar blockbuster status at the price we think it can command, the peak sales implied within ten years could be $3.5 billion.

**Conclusions**  
In this article, we explored the therapeutic merits and investment prospects associated with psychedelics, specifically Psylocibin. While this abridged summary of the ongoing work on psychedelics is by no means comprehensive, we hope that it is a useful starting point for investors interested in evaluating the space. While psychedelics have the potential to improve the way psychiatric conditions like MDD, TRD, PTSD, and OUD are treated, they also come with economic, regulatory, and health risks that should be considered carefully by investors, drug developers, and patients.

Several factors could limit Psilocybin’s potential price to a degree not fully considered in this paper, including: competition from Psilocybin retreat centers in places like Jamacia; competition from compounds with similar modes of action but shorter pharmacokinetics, like N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT); a lack of treatment infrastructure; and barriers to adoption associated with lingering cultural stigma. While the patent law around psychedelics remains slightly ambiguous, analysts should remember that [enantiopure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiopure_drug#:~:text=An%20enantiopure%20drug%20is%20a,at%20all)%20to%20target%20receptors.) alternatives, [deuterated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterated_drug) forms, and other chemical modifications could circumvent barriers to competition and keep drug costs high. Investors also should consider the degree to which the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy dynamic could concentrate the economic opportunity in the drug administration side of treatment, rather than in the sale of pharmaceuticals.

In the coming years, ARK expects that scientists will continue to find new compounds that cause beneficial psychoplastogenic effects, improving the granularity with which neuroscientists understand the brain’s many networks and their associated crosstalk. Forthcoming breakthroughs should reveal more about the nature of psychedelic experience and allow clinicians to diagnose mood disorders more effectively while developing more effective and safe therapeutic agents.

Through this lens, the psychedelic movement might be less a triumph against cultural stigma than a revolution in neuropharmacology. We believe psychedelics could usher in a new era of neuroscience in which the insights gleaned through functional neuroimaging over the last twenty years will be leveraged to solve some of the long-standing public health issues associated with mental illness.",How “Far Out” Are Psychedelic Therapeutics?

Separately, Snap’s Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman and Peter Naylor, vice president of the Americas, have agreed to join Netflix Inc. to help lead its global advertising business starting in September, AdAge said in a report on Tuesday, citing statements from the executives and Netflix’s Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters.

Snap shares dropped 7.3% in premarket trading on Wednesday before markets opened in New York. The stock has slumped 79% this year as the company has faced a slowdown in advertiser spending on the platform. Due to the uncertainty, Snap told investors in July that it wouldn’t offer specific guidance for the current quarter.

To weather the business environment, the company has said it will focus on three main priorities: growing the user base, improving direct-response advertising business and how it measures ad spending and finding new sources of revenue.

TSLA was **THE MOST** heavily shorted stock in the world in mid 2020. How do you think it's so fucking high in value and went ballistic and 10x in less than 1 year? Now its gone literally nowhere for almost 2 years. The shorts getting fucked hard had a LOT to do with TSLA epic 2020 run. Cherry picking here, from Jan '21 to now, TSLA is about even, maybe slightly down -2%. 600 days later, a shit ton of sales and growth, new models, new factories, etc and other good shit, and its gone nowhere because people learned to fear shorting TSLA.

**-** **Gamestop** **(GME)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $20 billion)*** needs no introduction but it was $4 pre-split and in pre-split terms went to $400+ and still sitting at pre-split $120 and about pre-split $200 a month ago. You're telling me GME went from $4 to $120-$200 range because RC is turning it around with NFTs no one gives a fuck about anytime soon? What's his play, sell video games online? Platforms already do that. Or let me guess, going to offer everyone 1 penny for their trade-ins instead of 2 pennies? LMFAO...What moat does GME have that any Megacap like GOOG, META, AMZN, MSFT, etc etc can't copy or do better? Fuck it, Netflix probably has more customers and a better chance selling NFTs than GME LMFAO. Even dare I say Robinhood could probably do it better. 

**Shit does not need to make sense nor be rational.** If your argument against BBBY going to $30, $50, $100, or $500 is the ""value"" of BBBY isn't worth that much and that is an irrational price target, then you are completely mistaken and don't understand how the market works. BBBY could become the world's most valuable company this week if there were enough shorts getting their nuts squeezed off. Of course, this is completely irrational and beyond unrealistic but you get my point. 

Now I know everyone is expecting some epic news release tomorrow and the price to rip to $30 but that isn't going to happen. Stop being dumb and unrealistic. Usual news is not some magical saving grace and automatic doubling of revenue everyone dreams about. The news will 100% give the shorts a reason to attack the fuck out of the stock and since everyone is impatient and a little paper-handed bitch, BBBY WILL drop like a MOFO tomorrow. Stop being little bitches and hold your panties up with those diamond hands. Don't drop 'em for the hedgies. **Stop Losses are for losers!**

To BUSINESS!

Forget Fun-dementials, SHF, forget Cohen, forget all that fluff. Since the dawn of time, early bird got the worm. Is the bird smarter? Is it stronger? Is it just lucky? Dunno. Don't give a shit. When you surf a wave, you don't ponder where in the ocean it got started. You catch it EARLY, and you HOLD THE FUCK ON.

I've been seeing some people struggle with the play here, and the whole ""rEaSoN"" why we're here.

Okay. From the top.

SCENARIO 1:
Fellas. Let us begin by assuming we are all pretty much dead wrong. In that case, the big shorts know how to trick us, the SI is dead wrong at &gt;100%, And we're essentially doing a soft but very public pump n' dump.

MEANING:
JUST PLAY THE FUCKING PYRAMID. This isn't a team sport, fuck you and don't fuck your wife cuz she got AIDS from me. Sure. It's slimy AF. But what the fuck isn't in Wall Street? Eat your crayon and fuck your watermelon.


SCENARIO 2: 
Okay, let's assume we're  NOT wrong, but obviously this lovely ape poop echochamber/toilet is making us hear our own ape noise as whispers of the deep state. A'ight. Let me present to you two exhibits to google. ""GameStop short squeeze"" and ""Self-induced consensus of Reddit users to characterise the GameStop short squeeze"".
The exhibits TLDR is, more than any other manipulation or attempt to influence us, the biggest factor here is NATURAL MOMENTUM. Essentially, Jimmy isn't wrong and incompetent (I DONT BELIEVE THAT BUT ROLL WITH IT) and probably not paid by hedgies, at the very very very least not directly. Nor does he have a major stake in this. NOBODY does. Not Yahoo, CNBC... ANYONE. Only sad HF managers and some rich but not exotically rich asscunts.
(remember guys. SCENARIO. Not my opinion nor my inverse opinion.)

APE BRAIN HURT, EXPLAIN IN NOISES!:
We're literally inviting anyone who agrees with us how dumb the shorts are to play this to our side. Not because they ""like"" us, but because that's the only play.
What would you do if you ran BlackRock? Attempt a strategy with infinite risk or claim that risk to your pocket?
EXACTLY. (refer to ""Gains by existing shareholders and third parties"" under ""Impact on involved entities"" on exhibit A).

Also, see my note below if you're interested in the future of Wall Street as a whole, and why I think we're literally the grave diggers for shorts for the rest of history (or until H. sapiens forget. They do that alot.)

SCENARIO 3:
Basically, not only is every positive verification of our retarded notions from S2 are correct, but so are ALOT of our theories.

I'm saying, for example
-Major mass-media players really are held by extremely wealthy and risk-loving 1%ters.
-Jimmy really does sell instructions for dummies, rather than being an ""ExPeRIEnceD TraddeRRR""
-Rich people know other rich people, and are more likely to be connected in a social sense. (That's just a pure fact. Why do you think nepotism is a thing? Why do you think the gov bails out banks when it doesn't have to? and so on). Meaning, even if ""legally speaking"" they're golden, the TL;DR is you're less significant for their daily life than a fly that flew into their room. a fly they never noticed. THAT'S how insignificant you are to them.

OOH OOH AHH AHH!: 
Yes my friend, in-deed.

SCENARIO 4:
Basically, scenario 3++. RC/Someone is playing 5D chess, and a major sort of merger/acquisition/whateverthefuck is incoming. Gogl ""Kroger BBBY"". Is it true? I HAVE NO CLUE.

MEANING??!!!!:
That we're going to 1000$. I kid you not. Sure, I pulled that number out of my ass, but that's where I get the feces I throw at non-apes. Seems like a good place to look.
An acquisition means THERE'S A LONG PLAY.
***I AM NOT SAYING 1K WILL STAY THE PRICE. I MEAN THAT'S THE PEAK OF THE SQ I THINK IS POSSIBLE***

So, I think that is enough to text to assert my dominance over you. All of these scenarios are ALREADY highly likely.
BUT WAIT, you ask,


*HOW THE FUCK IS THERE A LONG PLAY, YOU FUCKING CROOK*

Look, retards. All the FUD about retail shops dying breaks down into 4

1. Amazon (and co.)
2. COVID
3. America, and along with it, THE WORLD, playing it fast and loose since the Information revolution began.
4. Worker shortages (refer to 3)

They are all complete bullshit. I'll explain

Worker shortages are pretty easy to explain. With the rise of automation and the ""common man"" being more informed than ever before, we just have people understanding entry lvl jobs are pretty much lite slavery with extra steps. Social security and working condition laws are a JOKE in the US. I'm sorry.

Fast and loose with credit - Refer to the 2008 Subprime mortgage crisis, the 1987 crash, the motherfukin great recession, and of course - The fall of the CCP by the hands of the Chinese mortgage uprising/two-way-rape. (Look up ""Github china mortgage"". It's scary and hilarious and wonderful.)

COVID. The mother of all poor excuses. I'm not even touching that.

FINALLY!
AMZN is going down. Why? take your damn pick. Workers' rights' movements are on the rise. A lot of sections are flooded with cheap, Winnie-Pooh made GARBAGE. Stock prices at an all time high. Bozos is playing with rocket fuel with his private capital. competitors are slowly catching up.
And besides all that shitstorm, you have two more critical things. ONE, retail will make a comeback, unless we're all uploaded to the cloud anytime soon. It won't kill amazon let alone ecommerce, but it will recover and thrive moderately, like it used to in 2010-2015. 
TWO. We're headed into a bloody recession. Cheap cloud storage? undercutting ecommerce? bloody CLOUD CHIPS (sup, Annapurna)????
Whatt does any of that matter if NOBODY HAS ANY FUCKING MONEY. E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E IS GOING TO LOSE. even US.
Prepare for fucking soup for the unemployed on the streets. WHO IS GONNA FUCKING BUY ANYTHING? WHAT FUND/INST WILL INVEST IN STARTUPS? NO. ONE.
copy and paste all that shit for BBY, WALMART, whatever. Only one I'm afraid of is COSTCO, and luckily they're not a threat.

907,1661748652,x0fw8b,1,"Warning: long post with a lot of numbers and sources ahead, there is a tl;dr at the end.

While everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple’s valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.

A lot of people treat Apple like it’s the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:

&gt;P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  
&gt;  
&gt;P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  
&gt;  
&gt;P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  
&gt;  
&gt;P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  
&gt;  
&gt;D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  
&gt;  
&gt;Long term debt: $93B  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Earnings: $59.4B

Currently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:

&gt;P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)

In their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.

Apple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.

The reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. 

Apple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple’s revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple’s revenue and earnings will drop even more.

Everyone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn’t as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it’s expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can’t see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I’m wrong.

Another product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they’ve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they’re gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [“mocked”](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.

Apple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it’s hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That’s a pretty big risk for a company that’s been bleeding cash.

And finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple’s main advantages with their software is the fact that they don’t show ads. When this changes, Apple’s software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple’s ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it’s hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he’s full of bad takes.

As Apple’s earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. 

If they don’t halt or decrease their buyback, they’ll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.

tl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it.

So let's say your stock doesn't have voting rights or you don't care about them.

Every freaking day you can spot that manipulation being out there on Wall Street. Stocks that IPO way too high get pushed into insanity before they’ll just drop them into the range of 5-30$. It’s so freaking obvious and easy for them as they start shorting after the IPO once the hype and FOMO are real. 

I mean, there are so many examples. Take a stock like DASH. I think it’s even overvalued at the current price, but that’s exactly what those guys know and want. They IPO it at around 185, push it up to 260, create a nice double top and then short it and let it bleed until it’s in the low two-digit range. While most will agree the valuation is still way too high, I believe that makes those hedgies even more confident. Like on Friday, there was that news that DASH is partnering with META. Just watch the tape and L2 at that time. It’s insane, huge volume, the stock spikes 1.5-2$ before the algos jump in and kick it down.

I mean, it just feels those people feel so strong. I’d love the idea that, out of a sudden, such stock is flooded with buy orders, and those guys get fu***d🔥and yeah, obviously, that would cost all of us money in the first place, but I love the idea of utilizing all the money that people use on those YOLO plays for such a play. I mean, I get it, those YOLO plays entertain all of us, but the reaction in the media after huge and unexpected squeezes will do at least the same for us.

All right, I just wanted to share that idea. Have a lovely weekend and enjoy those beers 🍺

932,1660263988,wm6vat,1,"Awesome article by Quiver Quantitative from SeekingAlpha today on their implementation of the Cramer^((-1)).

Tl;dr Jim Cramer sucks, and inversing his coke-riddled brain generated 26% CAGR since inception 1/1/22.

Brief summary below:

# The Inverse Jim Cramer Strategy

Aug. 11, 2022 - Quiver Quantitative

## Summary

* There is a clear and distinct trend throughout the history of stock investing slowly moving away from the professional money managers into the hands of the everyday man.
* Long before the rise and popularization of social media, it was finance and investment television shows that played a monumental part in the popularization of investing.
* In today's article, we analyze the performance of a host whose name has become almost synonymous with finance television throughout the years, and bring to you our new trading strategy.
* By leveraging the collected data, we present to you our report on one of the investing world's greatest legends, the CNBC's Mad Money host himself, Jim Cramer.
* We have built a trading strategy that is by design inversing most of Cramer's top-mentioned stock recommendations, which so far has proved successful in generating alpha on the market.

Top ten Cramer recommendations and returns between first and last buy ratings:

1. PG -10%
2. DIS -29%
3. QCOM -29%
4. STZ -4.3%
5. MS -15%
6. JNJ -6%
7. HAL -23%
8. META -19%
9. PXD -9%
10. MRVL -32%

Inverse Cramer performance:

The strategy tracks the performance of companies that have been most recommended by the popular TV host over the course of the past month. It does that by opening a short position in the top-most recommended companies while hedging it with a long position in the market index. The strategy uses an equal-weighted portfolio, with an implemented system of weekly rebalancing. This approach was successful in generating a CAGR rate of 26.18% given its inception date of the 1st of January 2021. It has a one-year return of 20.13%, as compared to the S&amp;P500 which generated a negative 6.29% return.

1. Movie theaters are not going to be successful. The product is shit. 3d glasses, IOMAX, sound systems— no one gives a fuck. Adjust the gross revenue of theaters for inflation and you’ll see a huge fucking decline. Most people do not want to haul their ass to a gross, noisy, sticky, and crowded room to watch something they can’t even pause, when they could do it in their own home. Titanic grossed double anything after it in real dollars and that shit is not happening again. People don’t want the product and they are increasingly aware of alternatives.

2. The metaverse is going to flop. Seriously this is all super old bullshit. Tech is trying to create a market need or want that does not exist. People don’t want to dress up an avatar version of themselves and watch it do cartoony bullshit. They want to do it themselves. VR has been “5 years” from being big my entire fucking life. It was not true then, it’s not true now. The meta verse is a solution looking for a problem. There is no problem it solves. Trying to “redefine” what the term is not going to make what it actually is, a wanted product. Tech has never succeeded in doing that. They have just tapped into already existing needs and worked them. Like, socialization and content consumption. In no way is anything meta superior to a real life experience or even a real life flat screen experience. The only stuff happening in this area is ar glasses if they get massively better.

3. “Blockchain” / NFTs / Digital coins. Speaking of solutions looking for problems, holy fuck. There is no fucking need for a “public ledger” or “smart contracts”— our current exchanges work pretty damn well and most contracts outside stock exchanges are for goods and services that are tangibly delivered or concern dollar amounts where you want humans at a law firm involved. There is no value. Except buying drugs. That is the only real use of this shit.

4. Old crumbly brick and mortar specialty stores.  Like Bed Bath and Beyond. Can’t beat Amazon, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. No one wants to pay retail for shit they can price check from a cell phone.

If you are into this stuff, understand that money is made here by selling after bigger idiots jump on, and that, eventually, a business case is needed. These do not have any. So have fun and meme away, but if you are seriously trying to make real money, you need to be able to say one simple sentence: X is going to go up because real people want X, demand for X is growing, and X fulfills a real need.

949,1659541558,wf9yto,1," The economy is in a recession and the job market is set to slow, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood told CNBC.

Wood said that the Fed is focused on lagging indicators like CPI and jobs data, as reason to why her view differs from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

Wood said her flagship growth fund is likely set for solid performance after it bottomed well before the broader market.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is certain that the US economy has already entered a recession, according to an interview with CNBC on Friday.

""What we do see in these earnings results is that we are in a recession... We think this is an inventory-led recession, and I think that's coming through loud and clear. We're seeing advertisers cut back dramatically,"" Wood said.Recent earnings results from Snap and Meta Platforms revealed that advertisers were indeed slowing their spending on those platforms in recent months, while Walmart and Target have warned that excess inventory will drag on their profits this year.

Wood's view of the current status of the US economy differs from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's view, who said last month that he isn't seeing signs the economy has entered a recession. But Powell and the Fed are mostly focused on lagging indicators, Wood said, like the employment market and inflationary readings like CPI.

That means the Fed likely won't acknowledge the economy is in a recession until it's already happened.

Long META and Short DLVHF

META is a high quality company. It has generated high stable growth in recent years, a comparatively high return on equity, ROIC, and a high net profit margin and healthy debt. The PEG ratio is below two, which is a favorable valuation for the Internet software industry and such a large company. I also think that the sell-off was too exaggerated. My target price based on a performance-based enterprise valuation (DCF) is $250

As a pair trade hedge for META, I added the value destroyer Delivery Hero (WACC &gt; ROIC), which has a high correlation to META (86%).

Human traders cannot possibly make the right moves as highly advanced algorithms are already 10 steps ahead”.  

Part of the fear surrounding algo-trading is the nefarious idea the algorithms are designed to extract as much wealth as possible from real human beings and place it into the hands of the algorithms.  Khan continued “... if algo-trading is not regulated soon, there is no telling how much impact it could have in the future, we fear the impact could grow exponentially…”.  Her logic seemed to imply the more money the algorithms control the greater the impact they will have on the markets.”

Once we learned this, the fear was advertising reduction will be felt across the board with big tech, e.g. GOOGL, AMZN, META, etc. And then came the GOOGL print today.

So now i'm reading that GOOGL's miss was better than expected? I mean, they missed. But they're directly looking at ad spend which still grew.... but pretty flat on a YoY basis.   


Let's shift our attention back to SNAP to their DAU's (Daily Active Users).

We all know the DAU for TikTok is increasing, taking marketshare from FB, IG, SNAP, etc. WITH a slowing advertising spend.   


TLDR: Reduction of ad spend is not the main concern for META, it's the combo of TikTok eating market share AND a slowing ad spend market that will send META much lower. SNAP earnings are more comparable to META vs GOOGL's ad spend for Q2.

""If [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell says, 'we're getting a 75 basis point rate hike and then we'll see what happens' … then you might get a rip-snorting rally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.


""On the other hand, if he says we're doing the triple-rate hike and then we're willing to keep tightening no matter what, including a possible inter-meeting hike if the CPI stays hot, then we are definitely going lower,"" he added, referring to June's hotter-than expected 9.1% inflation reading.

987,1658846608,w8ll0v,1,"Ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech earnings later this week, Ed Yardeni has some words of comfort: the worst has passed for this bear market.

In the view of the Yardeni Research president, the S&amp;P 500’s plunge last month to a 3,666.77 low likely marked the trough of the 2022 equity rout. Underpinning the sanguine call is the resilience in corporate earnings and the still-healthy outlook for consumers and businesses even as the economy slows.

“It’s never easy to pick a bottom in the stock market, but I’m going to give it a try,” Yardeni said on Bloomberg TV. “The real question is going to be the earnings season, and so far the earnings season is going reasonably well. It has not really thrashed the stock market, and the stock market’s held up quite well.”

The statement is a large one ahead of a decisive week -- the Fed looks all set for another supersized interest-rate hike on Wednesday, while most mega-cap technology companies, including Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon, Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, will release their earnings reports.

Yardeni appears to be in the minority. In Bank of America Corp.’s survey this month, money managers said they’ve cut their equity exposure to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, a sign of no faith in recent market bounce. At the end of June, a Deutsche Bank AG poll showed 72% of respondents expected the S&amp;P 500 to fall to 3,300 first, rather than rallying to 4,500.

But if Yardeni’s track record is any indication, it’s worth heeding the view of a market veteran who coined terms like “Fed Model” and “bond vigilante.” The strategist, who worked at Oak Associates Ltd. and Deutsche Bank before founding his namesake research firm, called the equity bottom the same month when the 1982 bear market ended. He then repeated the success in March 2009 when the S&amp;P 500 reached an intraday low of 666.79 -- 3,000 points below this year’s trough in what he calls another “devilish number.”

Cutting cost, maintaining revenue, and decreasing the amount of shares on the market seems like a winning strategy to me for long-term growth.

ByteDance gets ready to take on Meta’s Quest with new Pico 4 VR headset
The company also plans to release a Pico 4 Pro version with eye tracking.

Janko RoettgersJuly 22, 2022
Pico, the VR subsidiary of TikTok owner ByteDance, is preparing to launch a new headset. New filings for a Pico 4 headset passed through the FCC this week, revealing the company's plans to introduce two versions of the headset, which include a “Pico 4 Pro” model.

Both headsets are standalone devices, similar to Meta’s Quest line of wireless devices. The Pro model of the new Pico headset will include face and eye tracking functionality, according to a document included in the filings. The internal code name for the new headset appears to be Phoenix. The product will be running Android Q and make use of a Qualcomm processor.

ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

There are few additional details to be learned from the heavily redacted filings, but the new headsets will apparently also launch with a revised controller. Partial device photos show both the controllers and the headset itself will be white, similar to the company’s existing Pico 3 Neo line of devices.


ByteDance acquired Pico a year ago. Prior to that, the VR startup was primarily focused on the enterprise market. More recently, ByteDance has been signaling its intentions to compete more directly with Meta and its Quest line. Pico began selling its current Neo 3 Link headset to consumers in Europe this spring.

The company also has been on a hiring spree in the U.S., where it has been building out a content unit called Pico Studios, as Protocol was first to report last month.",ByteDance gets ready to take on Meta’s Quest with new Pico 4 VR headset,1.0,2022-07-24 16:00:58

**When should I close my Puts I opened?**

If we look at the trend… regardless of what SPY does AFTER FOMC… it is ALWAYS best to close Tuesday before EOD. Close the puts EOD before FOMC… save some BP and then buy a put for the next drop.

This FOMC will be even more juicy to buy overnight puts (may I recommend SPX 0dte here…) because despite 3 of the four last FOMCs opening red the next day… granted only one of these was anything significant. Three of the last four FOMCs the following day has been red and the last two have both been -3%+ red days. This FOMC is special because the following day we get the q2 GDP reading… why does this matter? Because this would be our SECOND negative reading in a row and that would mean we are 100% in a recession… we should expect at minimum a -1 to -1.5% open Thursday morning. Now will markets dump or will they rip like after CPI? That part im not sure just yet on… we also have Amazon, Ford, boeing, Ford, Meta and pinterest the day of FOMC… this can be a hella big bearish catalyst especially if Google and MSFT have bad earning Monday/ Tuesday.

**How markets have played out at 2pm the last 4 FOMC meetings**

Now for January we didn’t have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets… so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don’t really equate this January one to much since there was no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. (initial run up till 210, dropped under 220 and then peaked at 230, dropped at 235, retested 230pm high at 240 and then by 245pm was breaking the 230 lows… from there we sold off until 250pm. Rested and then sold off the rest of the way at until 310pm when the bottom was in). 

March 16th FOMC we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. (235pm bottom is in but retested at 240pm).

May 4th FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji… JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (bottom was put in at 235pm) 

June 15th FOMC We got the initial pop of green that was followed by a sell off. By 230pm when JPOW spoke we had found the bottom and from there we ran for 15minutes. This was the first FOMC though where at 245pm we saw a major pullback to where the 2pm candle opened before it then pushed green again to make a new HOD by 345pm. (bottom was put in at 235pm)

https://preview.redd.it/5lwrz3svf6d91.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d26625f758956e94ca08386bf913e06aadc6664d

&amp;#x200B;

**How I plan to trade FOMC**

How do we play this? Well assuming this is going to behave similar to the March, May and June FOMCs we are going to take the opening price at 2pm and look for a 1% drop. So lets saw we open at 390. That means are BUY target is 386.1. Now the trick with this is PATIENCE! We CAN NOT fomo in and we CAN NOT get nervous here. The timing HAS to be perfect here… too early and youll get IV crushed (most likely will still get paid crazy good). The other thing that we have to be careful of is the wildcard market just dumps like January. The one thing I will say is that the January FOMC meeting was a wildcard and the market is much more understanding of FOMC than it was before in January. So I do think we will behave more like March, May and June especially. 

Okay so its now 235pm and we have our 1% drop at 386.1… this is where its dealers choice you can either buy say a 3-5OTM CALL or you can just stick with the try and trued ATM call. We are expecting nearly a 2.8% on average pop here… now of course that’s basically if you timed it perfectly top and bottom. For me I would safely set a 100% profit order if you entered anywhere remotely close to that 1% drop range and let it ride. You could set a 50% STOP LIMIT order once it gets closer to 100% and then just let it run till at least 245pm before closing it. 

The safest way though is to enter and immediately set a 100% take profit order. To be safe you could set a 50% sell order instead.  

The one thing to note here is that from 215 to 230pm there biggest IV crush happens along with the biggest fall usually and that is why you have to be careful. 

For those of you who wanna be aggressive AF… another play here… and mind you this one is the highest risk of them all… would be to take 0.5% from the 2pm OPEN price so lets use 390 again… 391.9 would be target… once that level is hit enter an ATM put…. And then ride that down 1% from the 2pm candle OPEN. So that would be down to 386.1… This method should net you a nice 50%. But this one is way riskier as you are exposed to IV crush and the way from the top to the bottom of 2pm to 215pm is wild and full of bounces and fake outs. This ones not for the faint of heart. 

**What if im wrong?**

Okay what is the wild card here? What if I am wrong? What do we look for… im glad you asked! So with January the pattern was different. Now mind you January was a completely different time in the markets as they had “no idea” what was to come and this was the first inflation shit the bed news, etc. etc. 

So with January we saw the spike at 2pm followed by a small sell off. The 215pm candle then just held within the 2pm candle which is key to watch for. We then saw that 230pm (when JPOW starts presser) was the peak and from there we basically started dumping. This will be key to watch for. If we aren’t seeing the Up -&gt; down -&gt; bigger up pattern started and come 230/235 we aren’t seeing the pattern making a bottom we need to be prepared to play a put instead. From 230 to 245 we dumped lower and then that 245 candle dumped us all the way until 245. Keep and eye on the candle bodies. If the candle bodies are looking weak and we aren’t seeing big wicks to the downside then we might get the dump like this. 

What could cause a dump like this? Well it depends what we see from the media this week and Monday/ Tuesday. The fed now is basically telling us we are getting 75bps hike and nothing matters. They said that 100bps hike wont help and doesn’t matter. We are essentially expecting a 75bps hike so if we get surprised with a 100bps hike AND JPOW throws some sort of wild card at us we might see a dump like this. 

The other wildcard which some are saying “how can you be so bearish for FOMC… the markets already expects rates, etc. etc. etc.” To this I do agree and this is where I say despite things being priced in… they are only priced in until the markets/ algos hear and see those numbers live. They its officially priced in. 

Someone else and other I am hearing mention that the fed may actually hint to a pausing of rate hikes from here on out and maybe even at Wednesday meeting… why? Because big tech is already doing hiring freezes and the big techs are already showing that stuff is easing… it doesn’t 100% make sense to me but I do see some peoples logic with it. 

So if we are under the impression we are priced in then we need to be prepared that at 2pm till EOD we just rip on FOMC giving us “good” news… aka not badder than expected news…

For this type of “good news FOMC” we gotta go back to December 15th and November 3rd 2021. 

If we are expecting bull run during FOMC we will look for a large 2pm to 230pm pop… large then the normal 0.5% fake pop… but the KEY would be that we see a small retracement leading to 230 presser starting but we do NOT break below the 2pm candles low. If this is what we are getting that magical 235pm time is still the best buy time. 

It is key to watch how the candles move and interact with eachother… and either way you HAVE to be patient… 235pm regardless seems to be the magical buy time… and almost all scenarios 235pm is the CALL buy opportunity… only 1 meeting in the last 8 meetings was it an actual put buying opportunity.",The only FOMC week TA/ DD you'll ever need to read,1.0,2022-07-22 20:10:59

I set up a public project to post real time signals from an algo developed over 10 years, accompanied by a trading strategy developed over the same period of time.

The scope of the project was 3 weeks of public signals posted real time for people to review and benefit from, but also to provide feedback on the efficacy of the signals/triggers on two markets I trade 1) DJI and 2) WTI oil. The signals had to stand the test of accuracy, completeness, timeliness and comprehensivness, hence the journal records appropriate meta data per signal.

The results:

Week 1 netted 1000+ points/pips in a handful of trades - approx 2 trades per day.

Week 2 netted 1100+ points/pips in a handful of trades

Week 3 has so far netted 1600+ points/pips from a handful of trades. 

I'm pleased to say every single trigger has won and usually within a timeframe of a few hours - with price action operating within predicted boundaries to manage volatility risk. So far the journal has recorded sub 20 triggers/ signals in total, netting over 3500+ points/ pips within the 3 week test period.

REAL WORLD A POINT/PIP COULD BE ANY VALUE DEPENDENT ON BALANCE (i.e. £1 per point, €100 per point, $10,000 per point or £100,000 per point).

Creating an algo is easy, creating a good one takes decades. Give yourself an edge and create your own, it could be the best investment you ever make.

1002,1658436831,w4rgvv,1,"Today was yet again another interesting one. Today if you missed it Biden was diagnosed with COVID… only mild symptoms. This was VERY interesting timing as markets had already saw a very aggressive morning rejection and was starting a dump. The new came out and the sell pressure hit some pretty high levels however, we managed to find support at that 391.5 to 392 range yet again and went on for a pretty impressive $7.21 run.

Something extremely interesting about this week before FOMC is that this is the first week since the November 2021 FOMC meeting that SPY has had a green week proceeding the FOMC meeting. So that’s only 1 other time in the last 6 meetings we have seen that… interesting to say the least. This is also the lowest the VIX has been the week before FOMC since January. 

What does this mean? I am not sure… but the sentiment right now is clearly very bullish but I think that we are about to see this change. The steam has been slowly fading.

SNAP just came in with a massive miss and they couldn’t provide guidance… after hours pinterest, google and meta all tanking on this… as I write this… everything is red after hours. Tomorrow is going to be interesting. So what am I seeing?

Kind of an interesting case here on the daily. At open today we had already broken the week+ long support line. This means that the rising wedge you see what and is broken. So that SHOULD be a sign of a drop that is coming. I am looking at that red resistance line and the last 4 candles on spy have hit it… today came very close to hitting it but did not have enough momentum to hit its 400 target. 

This candle is a hammer candle on paper which could signal a top. 

https://preview.redd.it/s4j32oxkizc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5827fdfa1467e78f8c99430e21c05defc436c976

The SPY weekly did break its resistance line which is bullish, however, its fallen short of its 400 resistance line.

ES futures perfectly rejected the 4005 resistance line. We have not however, seen ES futures break down out of its rising wedge but we are seeing that tomorrow and overnight this 4005 resistance level is going to be key. My expectations is ES will retest 4005 perhaps even the red dotted line at 4015 before it rejects and falls out of the rising wedge with support at 3945.

I wanted to draw some attention to Apples Daily chart. Apple has been in my opinion carrying this whole last month of movement upward. Today we saw a confirmed hammer candle on the daily and the last time we had a candle like this was May 17th which led to a massive gap down and a massive red day. You can see the last two days on Apple the volume has significantly dropped off which tells me that the buying momentum has faded and we should and could be seeing the top put in right now. 

Bull case- 

Despite a spotty morning we were able to back test 392.3 support and make it through the morning Biden Covid news. Despite the rising wedge breaking we are still making higher highs and higher lows since July 14th. Markets are still quickly pricing in all news. The weekly just saw a major resistance line broken and now with the June 9th gap only $2.60 away it is a natural expectation that this will be filled tomorrow as it is within reach. The bulls have clearly been in control all week with every dip being a CALL buying opportunity. 

Bulls will look to gap fill 401.5 and break through resistance at 402.4. From there it looks to continue its bullish momentum as we head into next week where bulls will look to reach the top of the rising wedge at 415 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

Bear case (this is where im leaning)-

This is the first earnings that really has shaken up the market. Now SNAPCHAT does not have a huge stake in the market BUT you can see everyone is being hit by it now. A little odd thing is that last earnings seasons SNAP report on April 21st and that was what proceeded a major sell off going into FOMC the next week… April 21st was the top after SNAP reports and today is looking to be the top after SNAP reported and FOMC next week… coincidence? Probably… but weird… okay back to TA…

Despite the bullish momentum today we saw that the support line that has been carrying spy fell today. We have now broken out of the rising wedge and that naturally should signal a top. The bulls for two days straight now have had an opportunity to reach 401.5 to gap fill yet have failed time and time again. Intraday the last two days we have seen some pretty heavy sell offs and sell pressure, however, at this momentum for now its been eaten up by the bulls.

With this hammer candle on Apple and Spy and an overall decrease in the volume on SPY, with 4 of the last 5 days being green (3 green in a row) and the weekend ahead it is a natural expectation that we see a red day tomorrow. With the weekend ahead and snap now missing earnings hugely and not giving guidance we should see people start to position themselves for the rest of big tech next week and FOMC next week. 

Bears will look to break down that 

If by some miracle the bulls can keep this momentum up tomorrow and they can take this to the gap fill and even that 403 level I mentioned I would be surprised. 392.5 and attempt to close SPY back under the daily 8ema which is currently at 389.5. A closure back under the daily 50 and 8ema would be a very bearish turn for the markets and would give a nice hint of bearishness heading into FOMC next week. 

10% challenge-

Today I did not make any day trades. My expectations were a range day and this morning movement was anything but normal. We had once again some major 0.5% candles and saw at times Spy moving up and down but 50 cents at a time. When the Biden covid news hit I was ready to take a short but knew that this could be the over reaction. Despite increasing sell pressure I waited and it paid off. Around 2pm when I saw how strong 397.3 resistance was holding up I did scale into a 1dte and 6dte put position. I had plans to scale in further EOD but with us so close to the gap fill I wanted to be cautious and knew that theta would eat me up overnight either way. 

My plan is to see where we open the 1dte has a break even (currently with no expected IV pump on a dump) of 394. There is a pretty big case that we could see a -1% or lower opening. With the dump right at close my average down only brought my breakeven close by $1 so the risk to reward was not there for me. If we open green and look to be going for gap fill I will consider averaging down there if I suspect an EOD sell off. If we open big red I will most likely just let it ride as If we are red I suspect a bigger sell off. 

The 6dte I wanted to scale into and hold this till Tuesday night. I suspect that we are going to see a pretty large sell off tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday especially. I will look to average down if we gap fill this otherwise I will consider adding to this in the morning. I most likely will take profits EOD and then open a new position for next week depending on what tomorrow brings. This 6dte has about the same breakeven without pump near 394.5. 

Not going to lie after a rough week of trading for me it felt kind of nice not playing anything and just watching it. The momentum was spotty at times. I never felt like the bulls had me convinced we were going to run like that EOD. I also have not been a fan of trading over the probable IV highs/ lows and we once again hit the improbable IV high.

With the assistance of ARMER back in May we got bored and decided to map out what the 2022 market crash COULD look like IF we followed the 2008 crash... and yes before everyone says it... i know this crash is different.. every crash is different... but all we have is historical data to go off of and trajectory wise we are the closest to 2008 then any others in my opinion...   


Anyways lets go down hypothetical lane... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/96ufqz2088c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801eb182455a55f55aeb2478d085466e516f26b6

Here is the WEEKLY SPY 2022 chart (i deleted all my drawings for easier viewing of candles) 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6kjonxc88c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38a32b7efb371e91fb22f25e3bc990305ce3a39

And here is the 2008 weekly chart... (i adjusted zoom slightly)   
Looking at these charts... it could be inferred that we are at the last rising hump in August/ September before the massive dropped started...   


Okay lets look at some numbers...   


2022 crash prediction based on 2008 percent's- 385 --&gt; 431 (11.9% rise) --&gt; 367 (15% drop) --&gt; 392 (7% rise) --&gt; 255 (53% drop) --&gt; 301 --&gt; 229 --&gt; 301 --&gt; 217

Actual- 381 --&gt; 417 (9.5% actual rise) --&gt; 362 (13% actual drop) --&gt; 393 (8% rise) --&gt; expected 53% drop= $189

we hit 393 on June 28th. We should be right around the top again then based off these numbers... 

&amp;#x200B;

Now according to the 2008 crash... we actually are at max level before ""the big one"" IF we actually follow the 2008 crash model... we should be at our last bear market rally and should see the capitulation any time now.... 

now adjusting for the overall difference in % expected vs actual we would see something closer to 40-45% drop from 393 which puts us at around... 216-235. 

&amp;#x200B;

using previous lows from previous crashes/ corrections... the blue dotted line utilizes the 2008 crashes low and the 2020 covid crashes low to give us a predicted bottom of 255 to 280 if we were to continue the current bear market trajectory... of course a true capitulation would accelerate this and we could see that number... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3g35f12y88c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2992158cbbf1a47b39ff11c7ff12b706de37fc11

red dotted line uses the 2008 crashes low and the february 2016 bottom to give us a trajectory of 295 to 315 on current trajectory.

lastly we have the orange dotted line which utulizes the two lowest points POST covid crash (Sept 2020 and October 2020) to give us a trajectory of 360 to 370 as bottom...

https://preview.redd.it/7k2vj07198c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4e6c4f634784dc8b329e6afcdc7209d567783dc

now the crazy thing about this 360 to 380 and using this covid 2020 recovery trend is that we already saw a bounce off that orange dotted line ( a near perfect bounce) June 2022 AND the weekly 200ema is now perfectly on top of this orange dotted line... 

&amp;#x200B;

what if we did know the bottom or at least knew how to predict it? 

&amp;#x200B;

it seems if we blast through 365 again we could see that 295-315

red dotted line uses the 2008 crashes low and the february 2016 bottom to give us a trajectory of 295 to 315 on current trajectory.

lastly we have the orange dotted line which utulizes the two lowest points POST covid crash (Sept 2020 and October 2020) to give us a trajectory of 360 to 370 as bottom...

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest issue with this all is the scaling of it... the 2008 crash was much slower. 2022 took 6 months to crash 25% while 2008 took 9 months to crash 25% initially. that means this crash is happening about  50% faster than 2008... so we need to bear that in mind. For reference the 2020 crash one month to crash 25% or about 9 times faster....   


so bearing that in mind when comparing charts and time frames... there is still a case to be had that the crash IS coming... the question is when and will we actually know? 

&amp;#x200B;

so what if we did know the bottom or at least knew how to predict it? 

&amp;#x200B;

it seems if we blast through 365 again we could see that 295-315  


  
In my opinion after i had 1000% expected to see a crash/ capitulation start Wednesday when that dogwater CPI came in... my best worst case scenario comes next week.   


Tesla reports wednesday night after bell... in my opinion not a big factor. It may hit or miss... i dont think markets care enough and it in and of itself can not take the markets down.   


The week of July 25th is one hell of a doozy...   

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel  


This right here is the ONLY perfect shit storm i can even remotely suspect to take the markets to the bottom... IF MSFT, GOOG, amazon all miss AND FOMC ""surprises"" (lol) us with a 100bps hike AND then GDP comes in thursday morning negative 1000% confirming we are in a recession and then APPLE tanks after bell thursday... The week of July 25th could be one of the biggest drops we have seen yet....  


https://preview.redd.it/37mxpuh6b8c91.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b47c7bd80590d3316b2ad028ffc322c7782b62d

  
so how should we play this? Despite what the numbers are calling for... i am looking for SPY this week to break out to that 400 to 415 level... on the weekly chart 415 perfectly rejects the black channels resistance line AND perfectly rejects the sideways purple channel... 

IF we get the big bull run this week AND end up somewhere near 410-415 by EOW.... AND the vix unwinds down near 18-20... i think friday before market close is our chance to load up on 30-60DTE VIX calls and SPY puts...   


and then IF by some miracle the markets still rally after the week of July 25th...  then i believe the bottom IS in... i think that orange dotted line i showed you above IS the bottom....

I saw a really interesting chart today that shows the UMICH consumer sentiment vs the Russel 1000 that shows they are severely diverted from eachother. 

What does this mean? Well this is the furtherest they have ever been from eachother in the last 30 years. There is still a lot of people out there that thinks despite how far the market has come down that there is still a very long way to go. I would have thought CPI woulda started the next leg down but that is not the case… lets get into that a little bit.

Yesterday the fed went from “we will not be doing a 100bps hike” to wow yeah man we really just might do a 100bps hike back today where now its down to a 17% chance of 100bps hike. The craziest thing about this all is if you look at the last CPI it jumped from 8.3% to 8.6% from April to May and JPOW shit himself and the markets did too with a massive 75bps hike that was not expected… now CPI is up 0.5% HIGHER than previous CPI (more than last time which was only 0.3%) and all of a sudden it doesn’t matter what we do rate hike wise and markets don’t care about 75 vs. 100bps hike? 

Confused? Me too… I touch on this a little below as to what I suspect is the true thing going on. 

https://preview.redd.it/t339fnversb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79712e9d1e204460a4cb516d7c50ff700396a6fa

I mentioned on the CPI night that I think we are experiencing some psyops in the market… the media is fueling this rollercoaster and we are being led astray for now. It is even more evident by the VIX that the “fear” is being contained right now… 

https://preview.redd.it/86mdud1grsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6863b2f55ecccf654fd87d8426b4d53b6f5ff82e

The VIX daily chart is very telling of current sentiment and that is that nothings going to take us down. After spy had 4 days of red this week and closed out today green for this week SPY is only down $0.72 cents on the week. They were close to closing this week out as a green week. 

This is the lowest close on the VIX since June 8th. Interestingly enough June 8th was the top of the last trend before we crashed. Looking at the vix there is a case that we could see a bounce Monday around 23.9 on the VIX at that support level which would let SPY truly top before we start our next leg down. 

I am also now if we break through that 23.9 level under the impression that the markets are going to completely unwind the VIX down to 18-20 level before tesla earnings hit on Wednesday night. Tesla will be the first notable earnings that could move the markets and then the week after that is massive with MSFT, GOOG, APPLE, and META. Not only that but we also have FOMC on Wednesday the 27th and then GDP is on July 28th the next day. That GDP should confirm a recession. 

Many of you red my UVXY/ VIX calls post and I do believe I was correct. The one thing I am wondering is if I was wrong on the timing. I suspect markets to panic from CPI to FOMC like previously but I am wondering if markets are going to rally from CPI to FOMC and then once that week of earnings and FOMC and GDP happen markets then panic till the next CPI and FOMC. At this point I think watching for the VIX to hit 18-20 and UVXY to hit 11.5 again to go long on some 30-60dte calls is the way to go. This is the lowest close for UVXY since April 21st interestingly enough. UVXY also has not closed under 11.5 since January. So that will be a key level to watch for next week.

The one thing im really watching on the daily is the close of this candle. It is a hanging man LIKE candle but the wick is not long enough. So this could end up like a continuation candle similar to June 23rd instead of a reversal candle like May 17th. 

https://preview.redd.it/om58fu6hrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee04dd25917171850484aaea0cbd89b3863abb7a

Things to note here for a bull vs. bear case on daily and weekly chart. 

Bull case- despite a bearish catalyst week we managed to close it with a dragonfly doji. Despite all the craziness we saw this week we saw a bullish finish to the week. We got our weekly 372 channel support test/ bounce. On the daily we broke through the red dotted resistance line which means we made a high high. We also close above the daily 8ema AND the daily 20ema for the first time since last Friday.  

Bear case- on the weekly we saw a new lower low for the third week in a row and that was also followed by the third lower high too. While we did not confirm resistance there is a VERY large descending wedge forming on the weekly chart. We have enough of the triangle left that there is a case we see a rejection next week followed by a descent below. Despite the bullish close today one could assume the last three days of bullish volume came from OPEX and how much downward OI there was. We now have a daily gap of $1.54 on the daily (note- this gap is actually closer to $2 as the daily movement of SPY never actually hit $379.05 on Thursday despite what the candles say). While historically gaps always fill we still have a 402 gap above unfilled so that is not something you can say anymore. 

Daily supports to watch- 382 à 379 (gap fill) à 375 à 370 (channel support) 

Weekly supports to watch- 372 (channel support) à 364 (weekly 200ema)

Daily resistance to watch- 388 à 390 (downward channel support AND sideways channel support) à 393 à 398 à 402 (gap fill)

Weekly resistance to watch- 388 (ascending wedge resistance) à 413 (downward channel resistance)

What I am watching for is whether we are going to attempt to back fill this gap Monday or Tuesday or whether we are going to break through 390. 390 is a HUGE level for Monday. IF that level is broken then we are actually hella bullish. With no major earnings to really effect the market and no real economic data to effect it either till Thursday at open we just might see a hell of a ripper early next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/5zggc0vhrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9804cfbd004521003749725d4227a650c72d2392

ES daily actually looks a little different than SPYs. I mentioned yesterday that it looked like futures was turning bullish and it appears Thursday might be the temp bottom again. We did see a rejection of that blue dotted support line at 3867 EOD today though but it closed over the daily 8 AND 20 ema for the first time since July 8th (which ironically was top). 

I am watching on the daily for Mondays open if we see a red open and we hold resistance at 3850 we will most likely be headed for a back test of that key 3744 support. Sundays night open will be very very important to watch. Anything over 3850 Sunday is bullish for the week. 

Daily supports to watch- 3793 à 3744 à 3672 (channel support) 

Daily resistance to watch- 3850 à 3915 (channel support) à 4020

https://preview.redd.it/305c46dirsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=946d2343961418ae9a82028e7630a4d59e9e8239

Futures weekly chart is probably the most bearish of anything I have talked about yet. So it will be curious to see which one plays out. 

The weekly chart actually confirmed the resistance of the descending triangle on Monday and closed with a true hanging man candle. This true hanging man candle has me suspect that we are going to see a retrace come Monday that takes us back down to that 3675 area. The futures charts are more skeptical and bearish then SPY itself. 

If we were to have a mega bull week next week we could see not only the descending wedge broken (any open over 3875 breaks it) we could see the overall downward channel and the overall sideways channel broken. It would take an impressive 7.7% move to do it but with the way the markets are running its not impossible. Or we could see a retest of that channel and rejection which could confirm further downside in two weeks for FOMC/ earnings/ GDP.

Weekly supports- 3830 à 3675

Weekly resistance- 3875 à 4136 à 4165

Overall SPY/ ES I would say I am bullish next week and will be looking to position to be bearish the following week. 

https://preview.redd.it/dwvgt6xirsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2140f0ae9ed8cec493e005e038ff089b4b17dbcf

AMD actually had a hell of a great day and week this week. AMD looks to on the daily have established a V shaped recovery at 71.6. My pre-market plan was to go long on AMD after it back tested 79.5 support and then go long with 7dte calls for next week looking for 87 range. I should have done it but I decided to wait. I am hesitant only that the markets are a little irrational right now. Most likely will regret that next week. 

Daily supports- 79.5 à 76.6 à 71.6

Daily resistance- 83.8 à 87

https://preview.redd.it/t7em8pjjrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a546f501675e7732e435ba25a37d583fd9868007

AMD weekly is in a nice descending wedge too. The weekly candle is a hanging man so that worries me but it should be able to push through if it keeps up the same momentum. Overall we are looking for 87 resistance to be tested next week and to hold that v shaped support line. If we break through 87… 95-98 is on the table for sure. But any retracement below 77 would be noted as bearish omen. 

10% challenge-

I had a great but boring day today. I did not like the open today as we dumped then ripped and had some wild candles. With the massively green open and UMICH sentiment I knew I was not going to go in until closer to 1030-11. By them we were already at the probable high of day IV wise and I was not going to play anything above that. My strategy is very strict about not going long/ short when SPY hits those levels. I also noticed that IV on SPY and AMD were hella high today and my mid day we got crushed. I watched 384.6 resistance hold all day long and EOD played a nice SPX (my first one) 0dte put scalp off the breakdown and then played a SPY 0dte call once biden was done talking and the volume came pumping in. Overall GREAT day and GREAT week. 

This is actually the highest weekly WIN RATE year to date for me. This week I was EXTRA patient and really waited for my plays and waited for the chart to come to me. It made all the difference.

I look forward to a good weekend to rest. I am sitting cash gang over the weekend. I was tempted to go long on SPY calls but decided to stick to what it old myself at the beginning of the month and do no swings. The biggest loss this week came from CPI day. It came from ANTICIPATING a play AND it came from trading while SPY was at the probable IV range. I did not stick to my guns that day and I did not let the chart come to me. I also double down on that loser which became 2x as big of a loser. Doubling down can work when tactfully done… but most of the time like I have said before don’t add to a loser to make it a bigger loser… I also took a loss on Monday due to TOS not filling my order completely which is a logistical issue I could not avoid and is part of the risk of 0dtes in the last 15minutes. 

Overall great week for me mentally and trading wise. Look forward to the weekend with the fam and seeing you guys back on Monday!","7-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX/ UVXY and AMD weekly TA",1.0,2022-07-15 21:07:15

Picture this… the year is 2022… we just had the worst 6 months in market history since the 70s… yet somehow we are magically now having the best start to Q3 since the 80s… Does that make sense to you? No? Good! Keep reading my friend! 

Before we go any further… the “You cant TA the VIX” comments… don’t hurt you little fingers typing that… I tend to disagree and believe the VIX is very trending when it wants to be… 

https://preview.redd.it/uiq73tjtpua91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fbc8e7740d9fab636584e19a505c3c294d686f1

Here my friends is the Daily Chart of the VIX for all of 2022. What do you see?

Green channel- this is where we spend a lot of the beginning of the January and February and briefly spent time in April. This range is 18.7 to 25.5.

Orange channel- this is where we peak in Feb and March and spent almost all of May, June and July until last week. This ranges from 25.5 to 34.7

You also see we just broke major “support” on the black dotted line last Thursday on the VIX. You also see we have been making lower highs on the VIX since January 24th we have not made a new peak. And we also haven’t made a recent higher high since May 2nd. 

Time wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX &gt;25.5.

Okay still with me here?

IF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX “bottom” tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn’t have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. 

This means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. 

Current positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn’t properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th.

What does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the “big one” and see “capitulation” finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn’t quite seal the deal. 

If my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. 

The one question that we don’t know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. 

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel

The week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven’t already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. 

What if im wrong? Whats the worst case scenario and time to cut bait on VIX/ UVXY calls?

IF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don’t see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. 

All I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC… Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July.

Estimated proceeds would be $5.7k but unlimited risk if the stock price soars through $180 in the next 46 days. 

Now I could buy a call with a strike price above $180 to hedge the trade. As an example the $185 calls with the same expiration are selling for $6.80. This would hedge my bet but also cost around $4.8k. This credit spread would significantly reduce my potential net proceeds. 

I was thinking an alternative to selling the $185 call would be to be to enter a conditional long order for 700 shares with a trigger price of $185.

**Part 1: The lore of the electric Käfer**

Spool back to the start of 2018.A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the “(not so) secret master plan” of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot harder and more complex than initially thought. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c

You know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to “fuck off” more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‘ll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting “Humans are underrated”. Heartwarming.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it. 

Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vapourware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.

If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it. 

Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

The deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts**

We have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the “funding secured” tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, we are now going to war. 

As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful “luxury” car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver ssist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. They combine everything MBA’s are afraid of. 

* Insanely capital intensive 
* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008) 
* Humongous unionised workforces 
* Stiff competition 
* Razor thin margins 
* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation) 
* Supply chains longer than the river nile  

You get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years. 

No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are damn impossible. 

As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need. 

Famously, Railroads are really “Transportation” companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers. 

That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don’t need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA’s darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP. 

What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business?

And cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can’t we? We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it.

If you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. FSD was going to work next year and don’t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins. 

Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.

Enter 2020. After a short rally into february, a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of normandy, this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.

Every person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something **BIG**

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: Liftoff**

Now with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard. 

**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee. 

So how do we fix the valuation? After we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic 

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients for any  good bull story.  Hype, momentum and FOMO. Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?

You bet! Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centrepiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. Bubbles burst at these G-Forces. 

This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.

Thank you for your service! Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was. 

All brought tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of 1TN+ USD. We gave back some of these gains but the valuation can still be described as “somewhat” lofty.

**4. The short the short shorts short** 

I am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning. 

**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: “Never short Tesla”, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.** 

As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project. 

And as we have learned, the market really can’t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick. 

For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/avdawlazbx891.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eb3d58ef40909c7dd075e46685dc085633efe95

I am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Teslas remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market. 

So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market. 

This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market. 

They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s try to read a bit into the recent clues. 

1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are “Giant Money Money furnaces” we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs. 
2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.
3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated. 
4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious. 
5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars. 
6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months. 
7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending. 
8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4. 
9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let’s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit. 
10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550. 
11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ⅓ stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now? 

This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to 200-400 within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking? 

* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow 
* Earnings are next month 
* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading. 

Ok, I am in. How are we playing this? 

If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, you are **TEAM “I might be early but I am not wrong”™** **Burry** , you buy puts. Depending on your personal risk tolerance 300 strike puts with 1 month DTE look about right. If you want to play it safe, LEAP puts for January ‘23 should get you going. This is where I am at. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Tesla's valuation might have a short term nosedive.** 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are **TEAM STAN** you buy calls because inflation is over and the price action this year was just a dip. Buy calls or shares, don’t bother me with the details. 

If you are **TEAM Retard**, you start selling puts on TSLA because the IV is nice and high and the price levels don’t look all the bad.

Canada's technology sector has grown rapidly in recent years, as homegrown startups and foreign giants set about hiring hundreds of thousands of well-educated and talented workers. But that expansion has recently slowed to a crawl, as high inflation, interest rate hikes and a downturn for cryptocurrency have taken a lot of optimism out of the sector.

Chris Albinson, CEO of Waterloo-based incubator Communitech, says the pullback in the U.S. is more pronounced because there are more of what he calls ""go for the moon"" companies with dubious fundamentals suddenly finding themselves unable to adapt to the new reality.

Canadian tech companies are faring comparably better at the moment because generally speaking they are much better stewards of capital, he says, but that doesn't mean there isn't anxiety.

""There are some founders that were 18 years old when the last recession happened,"" he told CBC News. ""There's going to be stress on the system, but I think they're ultimately going to come out of that much stronger.""

Valuations for tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Apple and Netflix have cratered in recent weeks, and where once there was a fierce war for talent, many tech giants are implementing hiring freezes and even cutting staff.

U.S. streaming giant Netflix announced Thursday it's cutting another 300 jobs, the second time in as many months it has announced layoffs of that size.

Crowdsourced website layoffs.fyi has documented more than 20,000 tech job cuts in the past two months alone, mostly in and around major U.S. technology hubs like Seattle and San Francisco.

While cutbacks in Canada are less dramatic, they are happening.

Canadian financial tech unicorn Wealthsimple laid off 13 per cent of its staff last week, citing ""unprecedented"" levels of volatility in explaining the cut of roughly 160 positions.

1- Mark Zuckerberg. Yes sounds silly but he is a genius and I do trust his long term plans.

2- With an increasing level of retardation, social awkwardness, and depression of people and especially young people, I think there would be a huge demand on the metaverse as a way to escape reality. Also, with improvement this could attract all the addicted people of video games, etc etc...

Who'da thunk it?  
\_\_\_\_  


ByBen Steverman and Scott Carpenter

December 14, 2021, 9:56 AM EST

Mark Zuckerberg sold Meta Platforms Inc. stock almost every weekday of this year. The founders of Google began to unload shares in May, which is also when two of the three Airbnb Inc. co-founders started diversifying their stakes. 

The transactions are part of a surge of selling by the very richest Americans. They unloaded $42.9 billion in stock through the start of December, more than double the $20.2 billion they sold in all of 2020, according to an analysis of transactions by U.S. billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the world’s richest 500 people.

The super-wealthy often hold onto shares in the companies that made their fortunes, because realizing gains triggers a tax bill. But many rich Americans are deciding to unload shares now, while stock valuations are at records and before their taxes potentially rise at the start of 2022.

# Here's What You Need to Know

Stock markets and Digital Asset markets continue to get decimated, as margin calls are reported as coming in, hitting multiple institutions.  Yet, Game Stop Corp continues to rise.  Game Stop Corp shares have not dropped considerably this year, which has unfortunately not been the case for other tickers which have been suffering - names such as Amazon, Meta, SnapChat, Google, Apple, Tesla, and other companies that have experienced marked declines.

Please share your thoughts, as Game Stop Corp approaches the phase where it will launch its own digital asset marketplace, as well as issuance of its stock dividend/split, which will affect all agencies and institutions which have an interest (or otherwise an adverse interest), whether it be reported or unreported interest, in Game Stop Corp.",❤ Game Stop Corp stock ❤ soars while markets collapse.

1073,1654788687,v8jfdl,1,"Duolingo ($DUOL) is a language-learning app trading at a market cap of $3.95B. 

In 2022, Duolingo estimates revenues will be between $349-358 million, and profit will be between $0-3 million, meaning Duolingo is trading at 11x 6-months forward revenue and 2,633x 6-months forward earnings using the midpoint of projections.

In the most recent quarter, revenue grew 47% YoY. Forecasting this out, Duolingo is trading at 5.5x 18-months forward revenue.

Duolingo's valuation seems excessive given the leading consumer social company, Meta, is trading at 4.5x revenue and 14.5x earnings in the **trailing** 12 months. 

Anyone see the bull case here? I think Google potentially acquiring Duolingo is one, but I'm skeptical given Google has a wide corpus of language data from search and Google Translate.

I think we hit the market bottom so I am personally all in on FNGG.  What is interesting are the holdings:

I like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:

I would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.

At the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.

1080,1654278003,v44omx,1,"Purely a thought experiment. 

What if you were the head of a company with 80%+ market share in VR headsets but its still a money pit whose expense is hard sell to ignorant stock market analysts who call you on the carpet with daggers in the ready.  And of course you need to deal with that whole Congressional theater / digital rights shit show.   You then find out a company that possesses arguably the best tech marketing on the planet is about to announce a VR/AR headset at their next WWC event in a month or so.  You ask around how real it could be. You find out said company has a twenty plus year development cycle supporting VR and AR on their proprietary very complete echosystem /platform. Even their decades old OS-X - a child of the NextStep OS that supported Pixar's Renderman -  has VR/AR/CGI hooks.  You realize that software wise they could already be ahead. Ah but hardware? Oh a VR/AR headset is a glorified cellphone with secret sauce? Oh and they redefined the cellphone and made the device that people rave about already?  They can even just announce a new color and people lose their shit. Yikes. And you say they have marketing that can crush you and not break a sweat.  Whereas your marketing does not seem to land? Crap - any upside?  Well the ignorant stock analyst will suddenly change their tune about the whole metasphere because its less about what you say than how you say it and WHO says it. Because, you know, stock market analysts have the attention span of Doug - ""Squirrel!""  But then the digital rights thing - crap they are crushing you with their ad campaign about protecting your personal data and our ad campaign - oh wait - did we forget to do an ad campaign?  -  Well anything else positive? Well they never start a price war. They will not fight you to the bottom. So you can expect them to come out higher, possibly much higher. Phew that's a relief.  But did I mentioned their userbase will pay any price to have their products that fit in their ecosystem? That owning one will be the definition of cool and to not own one will be the definition of a loser? Oh and if it supports remote learning - parents will pay any price. It may be a killer app? And no one knows that market like they do because they built their company on it in the early 1980s?
