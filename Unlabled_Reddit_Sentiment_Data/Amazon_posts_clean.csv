* Elon Musk called on the Fed ‚Äúto cut interest rates immediately‚Äù or risk ‚Äúamplifying the probability of a severe recession.‚Äù

* Elon Musk thinks a recession is coming and worries the Federal Reserve‚Äôs attempts to bring down inflation could make it worse.

In a tweet early Thursday, the Tesla CEO and Twitter owner called on the Fed ‚Äúto cut interest rates immediately‚Äù or risk ‚Äúamplifying the probability of a severe recession.‚Äù

The remarks came in an exchange with Tesmanian co-founder Vincent Yu in which several others participated.

Later in the thread, NorthmanTrader founder Sven Henrich observes that the Fed ‚Äústayed too easy for too long totally misreading inflation and now they‚Äôve tightened aggressively into the highest debt construct ever without accounting for the lag effects of these rate hikes risking they‚Äôll be again late to realize the damage done.‚Äù

Musk replied, ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt the first time Musk has warned of impending economic doom.

In a similar exchange on Oct. 24, the world‚Äôs richest man estimated a global recession could last ‚Äúuntil the spring ‚Äô24,‚Äù though he noted he was ‚Äújust guessing.‚Äù That prediction came amid a slew of economic warnings from other business executives including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.

The Fed appears to be entering the late stages of a rate-hiking campaign aimed at tackling inflation still running near its highest level in more than 40 years. The central bank has increased its benchmark rate half a dozen times this year, taking the overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 3.75%-4%, and is expected to hike a few more times before stopping.

In recent days, Fed officials have said they expect smaller increases ahead than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases, the most recent of which came in early November. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is addressing the public Wednesday afternoon in a speech to be delivered at the Brookings Institution.

While the market shat on BB post the IVY frenzy the Chenster and his posse have been busy. 

Cyber is going to stabilize in next 2 quarters (see Chen interview at ICE). We prob wont see explosive growth but we dont need that right now. 

What we need is QNX growth and that is what we are going to get that per the TD investor conference yesterday:

1) QNX is on fire. Design wins are progressing at fastest speed. First 6 months generated highest number of design wins as the prior 12 months. 

2) Record number of developer seats deployed. That means preproduction design revenues are growing as evidenced by backlog going from 490 to 560. 

3) QNX Revenues on track to hit 15 percent yoy growth. The 200-215 range is secured. 

4) Slowing economy does not affect pace of QNX design wins. Auto OEMs are transitioning to modern car architecture and they have no choice but to integrate QNX. 

5) BMW highlighted as key customer win. No car OEM wants to build their own core operating system software. Its too hard and not a differentiator. It all goes to BB. Tesla is outlier. But BB thinks they can help Elon FYI.

6) ASP per QNX deployment not something they will disclose. But per car there are larger number of use cases for QNX. So on per car basis the Revenue per car is increasing. Example a high tech BMW will utilize multiple QNX deployments. 

Want a bonus catalyst? Ivy on track. Expect first big announcement at CES in january. Check out CES speakers. BMW chairman is one of the key speakers and BB just signed a big QNX deal with them.

A multi-page PDF is available from the call held on Sunday evening describing one investor's (mine) illustration of how Kandy would fit into the upcoming J.W.C.C.award announcement. (read as ""upgraded cloud for the federal government and for the department of defense"")

Kandy activitiy seems to be in two buckets:

Path A. an amazing amount of fine-tuning of Kandy to work underneath the Microsoft Teams Chat hood. Alot of this work was done between Microsoft and Ribbon, and then now Advent Technologies fully owns Kandy and seems to have recently completed the DRaas component requested or needed by $MSFT. So, relating to pathway A: this is at least one scenario for a buy out from one of the primes that is part of the IDIQ award on J.W.C.C.

Path B. to prepare Kandy as a pure cloud play solution, hence a keen focus on various softphone tools being able to integrated via the wrappers and software development libraries (sdk), and a focus on Kandy as a reseller of at least one of them called acrobits.

Path B is an obvious 100% focus should there be now buyout or Kandy is not playing a role in the federated communication model / dod communication model. Path B can exist in conjunction with Path A. Professional services headcount for Path B would utilize the various partners listed that are armed with the Kandy solution.

As a side note, J.W.C.C. replaces the original J.E.D.I. contract. Microsoft and Amazon are incumbents on the militarized and/or federated cloud with the U.S. Government. The PDF-file shows how the pieces are put together, as a possible solution based solely on due diligence.

As a key note, the due diligence stems from not only the author but a slew of persons reviewing hints and financials during multiple conference calls over the last few months.

A validation that has come through is the secure version of Microsoft's Azure cloud to be utilized by military contractors such as Lockheed Martin.

23,1669045333,z122gg,1,"Amazon founder and billionaire entreprenuer Jeff Bezos has advised the American people to avoid large purchases such as new TVs, refrigerators or cars and ‚Äúkeep some dry powder on hand‚Äù during the coming holiday season as the US economy is likely to be in a recession soon, according to a report in the CNN.

The tycoon had last month tweeted to his followers ‚Äúto batten down the hatches‚Äù. When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.

He said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession ""very soon"".

‚ÄúTake some risk off the table,‚Äù Bezos told CNN. ‚ÄúKeep some dry powder on hand... Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You‚Äôve got to play the probabilities a little bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe economy does not look great right now,"" he said, adding, ""Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy"". ""The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon.""

The fourth richest person in the world said many people may be ‚Äúfeeling the pinch now‚Äù because of the extended economic downturn, but he appeared confident of a reverse in the trend in the coming time, saying as an optimist he believes the American Dream ‚Äúis and will be even more attainable in the future‚Äù.

Several other leading investors and analysts too have cautioned the American public about an impending recession. They have cited the Federal Reserve‚Äôs continuous efforts to curb inflation, which increased to a 40-year high of 9.1 per cent in June and remained at 7.7 percent until a month ago.

In the interview, Bezos also said that he will donate a majority of his $124 billion net worth to charities to fight climate change and growing social and political divisions.

1. **Introduction**

**Funko Inc.** is an American company selling limited pop culture collectibles, mostly under license agreements with well known brands. Their business is built on a belief that everyone is a fan of something, and Funko aims to have something for every fan. In this respect, their aim is to build a large and diverse set of licenses with the ability to leverage evergreen content. Some examples of their licenses:

1. **Business Model**

Products

Funko currently has 3 core product segments:

1. Pop! figures - Funko‚Äôs is our most well-recognized brand introduced in 2010. The Pop! is a range of unified 4 inch tall bobbleheads, that are customized into characters (from a game, TV show etc.). Pop! branded products represented 79%, 76%, 74% and 76% of sales in 2019, 2020, 2021 and YTD‚Äô22, respectively
2. Loungefly - Acquired in June 2017, Loungefly products are fashion focused stylized handbags, backpacks, small leather goods and accessories. Loungefly branded products represented 9%, 13%, 14% and 18% in 2019, 2020, 2021 and YTD‚Äô22,  respectively
3. Other brands - Mystery Minis, Paka Paka, and Popsies. Other brands also include product lines marketed directly under the broader Funko brand, such as Funko Games, Funko action figures, Funko Soda, Funko Plush, and Funko Gold product lines. Other brands represented 12%, 11%, 12% and 5% in 2019, 2020, 2021 and YTD‚Äô22,  respectively

&amp;#x200B;

[Sales split by Product](https://preview.redd.it/jbqhqpy0e61a1.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7226a955f9ff03ac160b9a851d28a013199ef240)

Licenses 

Funko has strong licensing relationships with many established content providers, such as Disney, HBO, LucasFilm, Marvel, Netflix,Pok√©mon, the NFL, Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Warner Bros etc. Their license agreements typically have terms of between two and three years and are not automatically renewable. The licensing agreements require them to make royalty payments to the licensor based on sales of the licensed product. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the average royalty rate was 15.7%, 16.1% and 15.9%, respectively ($162m, $105m and $127m in dollar terms).

For the year ended December 31, 2021, 26% of sales were related to the Company‚Äôs two largest license agreements (13% each) with no other license agreements accounting for more than 10% of sales, hence the licenses are well diversified. 

To note: Funko does not have exclusive rights to any of the properties they license or the related entertainment brands

Product Design and Development

Funko‚Äôs flexible and low-fixed cost production model enables them to move from product design of a figure to shipping from the factory in as few as 70 days and to the store shelf typically between 110 and 200 days, with a minimal upfront investment for most figures of $5,000 to $7,500 in tooling, molds and internal design costs. 

However, during 2021 and 2022 they have seen some delays with the global capacity constraints and the availability of shipping containers, increasing the above numbers. More on that later

heir products are produced mainly by third-party manufacturers primarily in Vietnam and China. 

Key material inputs for their products are vinyl, fabric, ceramics and plastics. 

Sales

Funko sells their products to a diverse network of customers throughout the world as well as directly to our consumers primarily through our own websites and two flagship retail stores.Their key retail partners in the United States include Amazon, GameStop, Hot Topic, Target and Walmart.

Their retail customers make no binding long-term commitments regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any retailer can therefore freely reduce its overall purchase of their products, and reduce the shelf space allotted for our products.

Their customer base is diverse, with their top ten customers representing approximately 45%, 48% and 44%, of 2021, 2020, and 2019 sales, respectively. No single customer accounted for over 10% of revenues during these periods.

In terms of geography, Funko sells c 70% of their products in the US, 20% is Europe and the remaining 6% in Other countries. All core geographies displayed a strong growth of &gt;25% for the Q3‚Äô22 period.

Major ownership changes in 2022

In May 2022, a consortium led by TCG made a $263 million strategic investment in Funko in an all secondary transaction. TCG acquired 80% of previously ACON Investments‚Äô shares (at $ 21/share), putting their ownership stake to 25%. Investors in the consortium include eBay, Robert A. Iger (Former Disney Chairman and CEO) and Rich Paul (CEO and Founder of Klutch Sports Group and Head of Sports at United Talent Agency). Moreover, as part of this investment, Funko and eBay are entering into a commercial agreement under which eBay will become the preferred secondary marketplace for Funko and the companies will also partner on creating exclusive product releases. Additionally, Mr. Paul will bring his expertise in the sports and music sectors to help advance Funko's continued product expansion and growth opportunities in sports and music. Finally, Robert A. Iger will solidify Funko‚Äôs already existing strong relationships and positioning within the movie industry.

**3) Key Financials and Valuation**

[Key Financials](https://preview.redd.it/rx5nicfie61a1.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0da800f9831e2d312f964a6ed3b485838b3cc333)

Q3‚Äô22, as well as FY‚Äô21 saw large increase in inventories, which jumped from USD 60m at YE‚Äô20 to $ 266m by Q3‚Äô22, well exceeding the sales growth. The increase in inventory for FY‚Äô21 was largely driven by longer transit times due to the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äôs impact on the global supply chain, resulting in a significant amount of inventory being ‚Äúin transit‚Äù as of Dec 31 2021. The increase in Q3‚Äô22 was then further elevated by mass chains (stores) delaying or canceling orders, citing ""the broader economic climate."" Funko CFO Jennifer Fall Jung acknowledged in the conference call that with the big jump in inventory, they ""might have to do a little discounting"" in Q4 to manage the it down.  

Funko is also having problems with its new consolidated fulfillment center, which it opened in Q2.  The warehouse management software it expected to have available to manage its new warehouse was not installed by the time the warehouse opened, and its new ERP will not be installed until 2023.  The company is using (expensive) manual methods to manage its new warehouse, and supporting the complex upgrades to their core infrastructure has resulted in higher than expected short term operating expenses &amp; capex and increased margin pressure. Moreover, capex for YTD‚Äô22 were also under pressure due to the rapid rise of the shipping rates.

Combined, the above resulted in the company to post its first negative CFs in the past 5 years for YTD‚Äô22 (own calculation, see above). As a result, the company needed to draw heavily on its revolving facility, causing the debt to spike to $250m, in order to fund the cash-shortfall.

Moreover, while not currently communicated by the management, I believe that inventory write-offs for Q4‚Äô22-FY‚Äô23 can not be excluded at this point - however, as I will explain later, I believe the long-term outlook for the business is still solid and the business can weather the current headwinds. 

Overall poor Q3‚Äô22 results and FY‚Äô22 outlook during the earnings call (mainly margins, EPS, debt, cash and inventory) have resulted in the company losing c -55% of it‚Äôs market cap in the last week alone, putting its market cap at around $500m. While the above mentioned developments are no-doubt negative, I am on the side of management here in believing that their cause was due to one-off external factors outside the company‚Äôs control. Following the initial supply chuck, retailers are now cutting their inventories across the board for all products (a practice that will, once the inventory levels reach their desired / lower levels, end). Moreover, with the shipping rates falling, finalization of their new warehouses‚Äô automation and the upcoming price increases (announced to take place by H1‚Äô23), I believe the recent market reaction was overblown. I believe that, unless a full-blown stagflation is to take place, above problems should be largely negated and compensated for during 2023 and beyond, by both opex savings and revenue increases. Overall, I believe that the company‚Äôs high operating leverage (going forward), combined with its low P/S ratio at 0,38x, represent a mispriced bet on gradual economic recovery, as the stock is currently essentially already priced for a prolonged inflation / recession. Buying the company at these levels, the investor essentially receives the potential continued topline and margin growth basically ‚Äúfor free‚Äù. I believe that under anything outside the worst case recession + persistently high inflation / stagflation scenario, the company‚Äôs economics and current valuation look very attractive compared to the alternatives on the market. 

Side note: Funko currently currently intends to retain all available funds to fund the development and growth of their business and repay indebtedness. As a result, cash dividends for Class A common stock are not anticipated in the foreseeable future.

**4) Key Strengths and Risks**

Key strenghts:

* Deep and Extensive Licensing Partnerships, solidified by the recent 25% ownership stake acquired by TCG
* ‚ÄúFast Fashion‚Äù Product Development Process - from design of a figure to the store shelf within 110 to 200 days with a minimal an upfront investment of $5-$7,5k
* Further sales growth potential, both organic (domestically &amp; by international expansion), as well as through price increases (after resisting price increases for years, Funko has already raised prices in 2021 and plans to implement the second round of price hikes by H1‚Äô23). Major further sales potential by expanding their presence in the currently under-utilized worlds of sports, music and anime
* 2021 and 2022 saw a number of inflationary pressures and one-off expense increases (mainly in shipping, labor and raw materials). As those pressures ease, this should positively impact both margins and inventory levels
* Current streaming wars have all the major studios chasing the next big thing / series. And while on the one hand, while Funko is indifferent as to which major studio is winning the streaming wars, they stand to benefit from the increased spend on the new releases, as it allows them for further product line extensions 
* Evergreen content - recycling the figures of the classics represents a recurring revenue stream. For example, in 2020 there was a lack of new content releases due to the impact of COVID-19 on new content production and the movie theater industry. Due to this impact, the percent of Funko‚Äôs sales attributable to classic evergreen properties was higher compared to historical trends.
* Technology Innovation - the emergence of new content distribution services, such as Netflix etc. have enabled fans to connect and engage with content anywhere, at any time, in larger ‚Äúbinge‚Äù quantities. As a result of greater accessibility, more fans are spending more time per day consuming content and can thus develop a deeper affinity for content, resulting in more content becoming part of pop culture

Key risks:

* Further inventory increases - further inventory increases could further hinder CF generation
* Inventory write-off - due to large spike of inventories, which currently sit at 20% of FY‚Äô22 sales, potential write-offs or discounts can be expected
* Recession - major layoffs and / or decreases in consumers purchasing power could lead to reduction of Funko‚Äôs sales (non-essential good, one of the first on the cutting board from a budget constrained consumer)
* Inflation - continued increases in (inputs) inflation could permanently hinder Funko‚Äôs margins and cash generation, resulting in further increases in debt
* Loss of licenses - increased competition for licenses could damage Funko‚Äôs existing licenses renewals and / or their renewal terms 
* Funko / collectibles trend dies - In case the current appetite for Funko figures collection dies and / or new entrants stealing the customers base occurs, the sales, due to the products‚Äô non-essential nature, could drop rapidly &amp; significantly 
* Business is largely dependent on content development and creation by third parties -  self explanatory
* From production perspective, it is a low barriers of entry &amp; a very competitive business: outside the licenses and brand name, barriers to entry into the business are low (with mold for a figure costing USD &gt;10k. There is a large number of competitors willing and happy to steal market share at any time

**4) Catalyst** 

I believe the market‚Äôs reaction to Q3‚Äô22 earnings was overblown. The company did indeed see a significant increase in inventories and contraction of margin, however both are fully due to (one-off) external factors. 

I estimate that the shipping costs, which have already dropped to the early 2021 levels, and the full automation of their new fullfilemnt center alone should save the company c USD 20-40m in bottom line for 2023 alone. Moreover, the announced upcoming price increases should lead to revenue growth. Even assuming the revenue to grow only in line with price increases at say 10% for 2023 (i.e. no volume growth), this should lead to additional c USD 90m in NI (USD 130m revenue growth, less royalties and taxes). While as of the time of writing this article, the costs of plastics production have not yet shown real signs of a reduction, this remains as a further upside. All-in all, assuming inventories stay flat going forward, c USD 100m in tailwinds to FCF can be expected for 2023 alone, and this is under conservative revenues growth assumptions. Net income growth should follow accordingly, albeit with a delay, due to the currently large inventory balances, which were created under high-opex costs.

All-in all, at the current valuation of USD 500m, you get a rapidly growing company with at least USD 100m in normalized CFs from next year onwards (20% yield), plus a further upside due to potential continued growth of the core business. 

On the flip-side, if the cost-inflationary pressures persist, or the recession turns out to be very ugly, the company is unlikely to be able to expand its margins, but, at the current valuation of PE of 10x the currently already suppressed NI, the downside is limited. 

I see this as a high operating leverage counter hardcore-recession play, which should easily justify the USD 1bn+ market, unless the worst case recession scenario takes place.",$FNKO - market overreaction?,1.0,2022-11-20 21:46:44

The meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which took place in Bali a day before the start of the G20 summit, marked the first face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the two superpowers since Biden took office.

.

.

‚ÄúWe need to chart the right course for the China-U.S. relationship,‚Äù Xi said at the opening of the meeting in Mandarin, according to an official English translation broadcast. ‚ÄúWe need to find the right direction for the bilateral relationship going forward and elevate the relationship.‚Äù

.

.

Biden said the two countries could manage their differences to prevent competition from turning into conflict. A White House readout of Biden‚Äôs remarks said that the two leaders spoke ‚Äúcandidly about their respective priorities and intentions across a range of issues.‚Äù

.

.

‚ÄúPresident Biden explained that the United States will continue to compete vigorously with the PRC \[People‚Äôs Republic of China\], including by investing in sources of strength at home and aligning efforts with allies and partners around the world,‚Äù the readout said.

.

.

The US opposes any unilateral change to the current status by either side, and it is in the interest of the world to maintain peace and stability in Taiwan. Biden raised the US opposition to the coercive and increasingly assertive actions taken by the People's Republic of China against Taiwan, which undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Region and the broader region, and endanger global prosperity.""

51,1668479717,yvkezo,1,"Hey everyone,. 

I want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.

I'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event.

56,1668450428,yv839x,1,"Amazon is planning to lay off approximately 10,000 employees in corporate and technology roles beginning this week, according to a report from The New York Times.

Shares of Amazon were down about 2.5% on Monday.

The cuts would be the largest in the company‚Äôs history and would primarily impact Amazon‚Äôs devices organization, retail division and human resources, according to the report. The reported layoffs would represent less than 1% of Amazon‚Äôs global workforce and 3% of its corporate employees.

The report follows headcount reductions at other tech firms. Meta announced last week that it‚Äôs laying off more than 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, and Twitter laid off approximately half its workforce in the days following Elon Musk‚Äôs $44 billion acquisition of the company.

Amazon reported 798,000 employees at the end of 2019 but had 1.6 million full- and part-time employees as of Dec. 31, 2021, a 102% increase. The New York Times said the total number of layoffs ‚Äúremains fluid‚Äù and could change.

A representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The holiday shopping season is critical for Amazon, and usually, one where the company has increased its headcount to meet demand. But Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO in July 2021, has been in cost-cutting mode to preserve cash as the company confronts slowing sales and a gloomy global economy.

The company has already announced plans to¬†freeze hiring¬†for corporate roles in its retail business. In recent months, Amazon shut down¬†its telehealth service,¬†discontinued a quirky, video-calling projector for kids,¬†closed all but one¬†of its U.S. call centers, axed its¬†roving delivery robot, shuttered underperforming¬†brick-and-mortar chains, and is closing, canceling or delaying¬†some new warehouse locations.

Amazon reported disappointing third-quarter earnings in October that spooked investors and caused shares to sink more than 13%. It marked the first time Amazon‚Äôs market cap fell below $1 trillion since April 2020, and the report was the second time this year¬†that Amazon‚Äôs results have been enough to spark a double-digit percentage sell-off. The sell-off continued for days after the report and erased almost all of the stock‚Äôs pandemic surge.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the change in the selling price of goods and services sold by producers. The PPI measures price change from the perspective of the seller. When producers pay more for goods and services, they are more likely to pass the higher costs to the consumer, so PPI is thought to be a leading indicator of consumer inflation.

65,1668296458,ytlz9y,1,"We got TGT, WMT, HD on Tuesday premarket. There is no way these guys don't issue a profit warning for the holiday quarter after AMZN cut guidance for Q4. 

AMZN CEO:  ""We are seeing signs all around that, again, people's budgets are tight, inflation is still high, energy costs are an additional layer on top of that caused by other issues,"" he said. ""**We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period, like most companies**."" 

THAT WAS 2 WEEKS AGO, TGT is up 16% since then. 

Amazon forecast net sales of between $140 billion and $148 billion, or growth as little as 2% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $155.2 billion. 

Then on 11/10 in the midst of the rally everyone missed this nugget from Fed Daly

**""We will probably need to tighten more than the Sept. Fed forecasts suggested""**

[**https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220921.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220921.htm)

Median was calling for 4.6% fed funds rate by 2023, that's probably going to be raised to 5% or higher at the December FOMC.

Last bear market rally peaked 8/15 at $430. By 9/30 the market was at $355, a 17% drop. 

$400 Nov. 14 to $340 by Dec. 30 would be a 15% drop in the exact same timeframe. 

Retail is getting set up to get dumped on once again with an ""inflation peaked"" narrative. 

Inflation may be coming down but the recession is just beginning, good luck regards. 

 

""We are not convinced this is the beginning of a new bull market,"" said Sam        Stovall, chief investment strategist at CRFA Research.        ""We believe that we are headed for recession. That has not been factored        into earnings estimates and, therefore, share prices.""     

Stovall also said the stock market has yet to see the ""traditional        shakeout of confidence capitulation that we typically see that marks the        end of the bear markets.",Bear Market Rally: SPY 340 EOY,1.0,2022-11-12 23:40:58

Carvana, I could not get myself to trade it as a physical stock purchase, It went to many times south and I would have been stopped out. and while I did look at the options, I could not pull the trigger also . what it taught me is that I have a system, it works based on some characteristics, and I'll stick to knowing that i can sleep well. 

Traded tqqq for a fast $50, again I am not cut out for short term day trading, Not even week long trading. I need to look for stuff that has 8 weeks to 2 years of holding time. 

So this came across my desk this morning. Amazon ( when it was coming down from 98.5 to 97.5 ) and I am crunching numbers. Did my math and analysis. Went **long** ( when Amazon was at 100 ) with **October 2023 145 calls @ 4.26** ( yep that's my trade, horrible fill ), I do expect that by 12/26 I should have a solid grasp of the probable outcome. looking to exit around 19 when it's trading 144-ish by march 7th ( 3 x risk reward ), and if the uptrend holds shoot for 25 ( 5x risk reward) by may 18th around the 160 price.

SPY

SPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday‚Äôs low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday‚Äôs low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.

QQQ

QQQ held Tuesday‚Äôs low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.

DIA

DIA also held Tuesday‚Äôs low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th.

XLF

The financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.

XLI

XLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium.

But every quarter this company is making progress to make this crazy ludicrous business plan a reality. And there can be no denying anymore after this last quarter that CLNE is moving us closer and closer to a greener future.

Lets not kid ourselves. This has been a 15 year build. But rome was not built in a day. And after all these years CLNE today is the undisputed leader in not only RNG production but also RNG distribution. In other words CLNE is the only vertically integrated RNG play with both upstream and downstream business. 

The upstream business gets the most attention. Collecting cow farts is en vogue and all the major oil companies are talking about RNG. Not only talking. They are investing in this space and we now have seen multiple M&amp;A transactions as everbody jockeys to buy renewable assets into their portfolios. 

But the downstream (distribution) business is the real gem. And CLNEs CEO acknowledged that yesterday officially:  

‚ÄúNo company is as well positioned as we are by owning and operating the largest fueling infrastructure in the country where the highest value of the RNG is captured.‚Äù

The simple fact is that the fueling infrastructure that CLNE owns (550 fueling stations) plus the trucking fleets it has signed agreements with (eg with Amazon) is very hard to replicate and nobody has this. Whoever owns this infrastructure controls distribution to the end customer (ie trucking fleets) and has leverage over the upstream RNG manufacturers. CLNE today is dependent on third party RNG because it can not collect cow farts fast enough but in the long term it will push its own product through to the customer. 

In the next 12 months expect revenues to ramp as Amazon deploys its fleet of 2000 trucks and other fleets convert to RNG.",CLNE‚Äôs cow fart sales up 50% yoy,1.0,2022-11-09 19:17:51

* The S&amp;P 500 will fall to 3,200 points before it hits a low in Q2 next year, UBS has forecast.
* US stocks won't recover until the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, the bank said.
* ""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" UBS strategists said.

The S&amp;P 500 US stock index could fall another 16%, before bottoming out in nine months' time once the Federal Reserve switches away from hiking interest rates, UBS has forecast.

The Swiss bank's strategists laid out this scenario in a Monday note: ""Weak growth and earnings drag the market lower before a fall in rates helps it bottom at 3,200 in Q2 '23 and lifts it to 3,900 by end '23.""

The S&amp;P 500 would have to fall 15.9% from its Monday close at 3,806 to reach that low level.

The benchmark index has already slumped 20.1% year-to-date, weighed down by the Fed's tightening campaign, recession fears, and poor third-quarter earnings performances by Big Techs like Amazon and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.

UBS expects a slowdown in economic growth to carry on dragging stocks down until the second quarter. It also projected year-on-year global GDP will rise just 2.1% in 2023 ‚Äî which would be the third-lowest expansion in the past three decades.

""Our forecast approaches something akin to a 'global recession',"" a UBS team led by chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note to clients.

""For the US, we now expect near zero growth in both 2023 and 2024, and a recession to start in 2023,"" they added.

That economic slump would likely lead to a period of disinflation, they said. Given the US central bank has increased interest rates rapidly to try to tame inflation running at 40-year highs, that would give policymakers scope to switch to cutting rates to stimulate economic growth.

""Combined with inflation falling rapidly, the Fed would cut the federal funds rate down to 1.25% by early 2024,"" the strategists said. The rate is currently at 3.75%.

""The speed of that pivot will drive every asset class next year,"" they added.

Expectations of a Fed pivot could lift the S&amp;P 500 to 3,900 points ‚Äî a 2.4% gain from its close Monday ‚Äì by the end of 2023, according to UBS.

The bank also predicted that future rate cuts will lead to 10-year US Treasury yields slipping 155 basis points to 2.65% and the dollar slowly falling the ten most heavily-traded currencies as well as gold.

For starters, at the time of posting this PLTR is at $6.99, so if that's not a buy signal, I don't know what is.

Second, both us government and commercial sides are growing. I've worked for the government and I can tell you that once they start working with someone they like, they stay with them for a while. The fact pltr is continuing to see big growth in government just proves they're establishing a powerful moat. The commercial side is also growing steadily, and will likely continue to increase as companies look for ways to become more financially efficient.

Third, the company is making money, increasing its cash position, and has zero debt. I know people will whine about gap profitability, but they'll only be able to do so until we do reach gaap profitability, which pltr has been inching closer to each quarter.

Finally, they're one of the few businesses experiencing strong growth in a recession. I know some might look at pltr and say the price dropped too fast. But they had an IPO literally before one of the largest tech bubbles in history.

And just remember, a lot of big gains are made over years. Amazon was trading for the price of a cup of iced coffee after the dot com crash and it exploded. AutoZone was trading for basically $10 in the 90s and was recently hovering around $2k a share. Don't be a doofus. 

Peter Lynch said it best, companies with no debt that are making money won't ever go bankrupt. We're about to head into the heat of a recession where a lot of companies are going to shrink big time and a lot probably won't be here in 2 years.

That is all.","$TTD, Earnings Play Due Diligence | Before Market Open 11/09/2022",1.0,2022-11-07 01:27:13
91,1667778783,yo6uyy,1,"Intro: The Trade Desk (TTD) is an American multinational technology company that specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users. All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.

1). Massive competition 

As stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.


2). The premium is too high

They have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can‚Äôt produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can‚Äôt produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.

3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads

We are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.
 
4). The guidance nail in the coffin

Guidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.

5). Bull thesis

This is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind 

7) TL;DR

$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.

8). Position.

I have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday. Yolo, food stamps or Ferraris lol.

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds ‚Äî high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them ‚Äî have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

Not to mention the market cap of CANO is $1 billion less than the enterprise value (whatever that means, it seems good).

I'm sick of having to write this out in comments all the time, so I decided to make a dedicated post and educate you idiots on how Wall Street prevented FOMO into one of their most wreckless short plays of all time: **AMCX.** I'm not talking about the stupidest, fakest, most manufactured ""meme"" of all time, AMC Entertainment. I'm talking about ***AMC Networks***, the company that brought you such hits as Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, Killing Eve, and Interview with a Vampire.

Hedge Funds and MSM have been playing the ***""oopsie ticker mix-up""*** game for a while now and they deployed it in full force during the January sneeze. **And good lord did it work.**

Part 1: Amazon wanted AMCX, not AMC

It's no secret that Amazon has been trying to compete with HBO and Netflix in terms of streaming content. They've had some big hits to be sure: The Boys, Fleabag, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Rings of Power...but they struggle to put out content at nearly the same level as their competition. This was especially true back in 2019 and 2020, when this came out:

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-8303833/Could-Amazon-local-cinema.html?mod=article\_inline](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-8303833/Could-Amazon-local-cinema.html?mod=article_inline)

Wait...I hear you say. That article says that Amazon was going to buy AMC, not AMCX. ***BITCH DO YOU EVEN READ?*** Like I said already, hedge funds have been playing this ticker mix-up game ***long*** before the GME sneeze. Check this out, published just a few days after the ""rumors"" leaked:

[https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2020/05/amc-networks-shares-rise-amc-entertainment-dips-after-amazon-report-update-1202932702/amp/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2020/05/amc-networks-shares-rise-amc-entertainment-dips-after-amazon-report-update-1202932702/amp/)

In case you're illiterate, that article basically says DailyMail may or may not be full of shit and now everyone is confused. The ***""mix-up""*** even caught the attention of Peridot Capital Management, a Seattle-based investment firm who put out \[this\]([https://www.peridotcapital.com/blogposts/2020/5/yes-amazon-should-buy-amcx-not-amc](https://www.peridotcapital.com/blogposts/2020/5/yes-amazon-should-buy-amcx-not-amc)) blog post a few days later, arguing that Amazon buying AMC theaters was **""questionable reporting, at best.""** It was clear to Peridot that, if anything, ***it was AMCX that Amazon was interested in***, not a debt-laden chain of movie theaters that was on the verge of bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 2: Gabe was short AMCX

That's right. ***Gabe Plotkin, one of the greatest investors of our generation***, protege of Steve Cohen himself, was short AMCX. And he had **NOTHING** to do with AMC. There are even a bunch of articles out there where they mention he ""closed all short positions"" *(yeah uh-huh sure ya did pal)****,*** **including AMCX** \- and then they go on to conflate the two tickers. For example:

[https://www.tradestation.com/research/article/21209411](https://www.tradestation.com/research/article/21209411)

It wasn't just Gabe, of course. One of the other notorious GME shorts, **MapleLane Capital**, had an even bigger short on AMCX. In case you don't know who MapleLane is, their founder, Leon Shaulov, came from a cute little fund called **Galleon Group**. If that name rings a bell it's because they were at the center of an insider trading scandal back in 2009, which was also loosely tied to the insider trading charges that ""took down"" SAC. David Slaine, a hedgie turned tattle-tale, gave the FBI tips on both. So it wouldn't be entirely shocking to me that these guys were ***(gasp)*** in cahoots.

Anyways before I go down a rabbit hole, here were some of MapleLane's biggest positions that mimicked GME: all puts, hedged with virtually no shares or calls:

&amp;#x200B;

[These tickers probably look familiar - that's because it's a who's who of stocks with outrageous short interest during the sneeze. Note again that AMC isn't even on here.](https://preview.redd.it/s3hnt7yhrkx91.jpg?width=990&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e23a56b51c25a6053cc0d07fa8a841a86b8764b)

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 3: The Fundamentals:

Here's the crazy thing: AMCX is the exact opposite of AMC in terms of fundamentals. Whereas AMC is the biggest steaming pile of shit you've ever seen, ***AMCX is in \*excellent\* shape financially.*** They are sitting on nearly a billion dollars in cash, and are profitable to boot. They had net income of \~90 mil last q and positive cash flow. Point being, ***this company had no business having nearly \~60% short interest*** reported during the sneeze. That's not a typo, **AMCX was one of the most shorted companies in Jan 21**, as seen in this Bloomberg terminal snapshot:

&amp;#x200B;

[This is nearly just a 1:1 snapshot of whatever the fuck MapleLane was doing on their 13F, it's madness](https://preview.redd.it/mdl75l9lrkx91.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbf4e333c196db222d5b481d8b535a202e67d8f8)

At the time I'm writing this, AMCX has a p/e ratio of 2.9. This is some deep fucking value, even outside of it's meme potential. For comparison's sake, Warner Bros Discovery's p/e is over 11, and Paramount's p/e is over 8. ***Reported*** short interest is way down these days, but we all know that's bullshit. How do we know? Well for one, MapleLane has a bit of a history with ""accidentally"" marking shorts as longs. ***OOPSIES.*** In May 2022 they were given a nice little slap on the wrist specifically for doing this on stocks that became ""volatile"" during the sneeze. For proof see \[here\]([https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2022/34-94830.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2022/34-94830.pdf)), but in case that link doesn't work (it's a pdf) here is one part of the doc:

&amp;#x200B;

# ADDITIONAL CREDIT SUISSE TIN-FOIL

This is tough for me to prove, so take it with a grain of salt. But personally, I think that Bill Hwang of Archegos was short AMCX, or at least short volatility. You see, apparently, Billy had a weird thing for going absurdly long media companies. The moment Cathy Wood gave him insider info at church on Netflix, ***he decided to go balls-deep into VIAC (now PARA), and DISCA (now WBD).***

Reading the Credit Suisse report on how shit went down, it specifically mentions that he was blowing up a bit during the GME Jan 22 ""sneeze,"" but doesn't say why or what memes he was short on. It also mentions that, when they realized the Hwangster was so heavily concentrated long, rather than force him to liquidate ***they had him short ""custom"" baskets of stock.*** See below:

Tell me, if you were trying to hedge a concentrated long position in VIAC (and DISC), what stock might you put into that ""custom basket"" for Archegos to short? People have been speculating that Bill was short GME, and that might be true. But **AMCX was likely a large constituent in that basket**, IMO.

# Conclusion

***AMCX is a deep fucking value*** that hedge funds have been trying to distract you ""apes"" from. It had 30 million outstanding shares and nearly 60% SI, with over 100% institutional ownership just like GME. It was (and still is) undervalued, considering the state of their balance sheet and their consistent profitability. The same two idiots, Gabe and Leon, were short - and possibly Billy Hwang himself too.

* Amazon‚Äôs stock closed down Tuesday for a fifth straight day, falling to the lowest since April 2020.
* Last week the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.
* The stock dropped 5.9% to $96.79.
* Amazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.

Shares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock‚Äôs pandemic surge.

Investors continued to punish the company for last week‚Äôs disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts‚Äô estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.

It‚Äôs the first time Amazon‚Äôs market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.

Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.

Amazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.

112,1667322045,yje80q,1,"Some of Meta‚Äôs biggest shareholders have lined up to vent their anger at the social media company‚Äôs management after it stunned Wall Street with plans to ramp up its lossmaking effort to build the metaverse.

Even after a slide that has wiped 74 per cent from Meta‚Äôs stock price in little over a year, however, investors and boardroom experts said there was little outsiders could do to prevent chief executive Mark Zuckerberg using his majority control to plough ahead with a bet that has lost the confidence of Wall Street.

Meta‚Äôs shares tumbled 25 per cent on Thursday after the company revealed that losses from Reality Labs, its division that is building the metaverse, would grow ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù in 2023, after reaching $9.4bn in the first nine months of this year. Investors were also startled by another jump in capital spending that Meta said would consume as much as $39bn next year, more than double the level of 2021.

‚ÄúIf any other company had done this you‚Äôd have activist investors writing letters, proposing alternative slates of directors, demanding change,‚Äù said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer for US growth at AllianceBernstein, a Meta shareholder. ‚ÄúI think Mark heard crystal clear what investors wanted. He‚Äôs made his decision.‚Äù

The anger has spilled over into meetings with management, some of which Zuckerberg has attended personally since Meta shocked Wall Street with its spending plans late on Wednesday.

‚ÄúIt does seem like there‚Äôs a sense of frustration‚Äù among investors over the company‚Äôs ballooning costs, said one person familiar with the discussions.

Referring to the series of informal follow-up calls with investors after the company announced earnings late on Wednesday, Tierney said: ‚ÄúWhen people had callbacks with the company they got more disgusted, not less disgusted.‚Äù

‚ÄúZuckerberg was tone-deaf to the investment community, doubling down on everything,‚Äù said David Older, head of equities at ‚Ç¨33.2bn asset manager Carmignac, which has holdings in Amazon, Microsoft and Google but not Meta. ‚ÄúThe timeline for the metaverse is very stretched. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to know if it is the right move for five or 10 years.‚Äù

Launched in 2016, IIP is the first publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange to provide real estate capital to the regulated cannabis industry. The company's sale-leaseback program includes cultivation, processing and retail properties with carefully chosen tenants that are licensed operators under long-term, triple-net leases.

Over the last five years, IIP's stock has outperformed some of the most popular stocks in the world, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). That's not all, the company has been paying consecutive quarterly dividends to its common stockholders since the second quarter of 2017.

The San Diego, California-headquartered marijuana REIT is focused on well-capitalized and state-licensed cannabis businesses across all product types, targeting deals in the amounts of $5 million to $30+ million. Its standard lease terms last from 10 to 20 years, with initial base rents of 10% to 16% on total investment.

(OTCQX: CURLF), Trulieve Cannabis (OTCQX: TCNNF), PharmaCann, Cresco Labs (OTCQX: CRLBF), Columbia Care (OTCQX: CCHWF), Green Thumb Industries (OTCQX: GTBIF), Goodness Growth Holdings (OTCQX: GDNSF), 4Front Ventures (OTCQX: FFNTF), Holistic Industries, Ayr Wellness (OTCQX: AYRWF), Parallel, and Ascend Wellness Holdings (OTCQX: AAWH).

As of September 1, 2022, IIP owns 111 properties comprising an aggregate of around 8.7 million rentable square feet (including approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet under development or redevelopment) in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

In its latest earnings report, the company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.9 million for the second quarter of 2022, or $1.42 per diluted share, and AFFO of approximately $60.1 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. It also paid a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per common share on July 15, 2022, to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2022, representing a 25% increase over the prior year's second quarter 2021 dividend, equal to an annualized dividend of $7.00 per share.

Lets flash back to last Friday‚Ä¶ The beginning of of the week had a nice green two days followed by a doji Wednesday and a hammer candle on Thursday. This hammer candle showed downside potential and after hours did too. Then Friday came and out of no where ripped a 2.45% green day‚Ä¶ Flash forward to this week its nearly an identical movement. I mean 100% identical. Scary at best. 

Today I am not too proud to admit I misplayed 100% and I unknowingly was far to bearish and bet against the markets. The worst part is‚Ä¶ I even called this weekly rally last week in my weekly TA.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3a56ccw7mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f85daeb5ea4b1cf9f4dac4f908e24f3738ffc38

Guess I should trust myself a little more huh? I definitely got blinded by the big tech earning misses, GDP coming in hot af, PCE/ PMI, job claims, etc etc etc. all of that was bearish af for the week. But what happened? Market didn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ why? Because the markets still believe JPOW is going to say on Wednesday at 230pm for FOMC (stay tuned this weekend I will release the FOMC trading plan to the server) that ‚Äúwe have inflation under control or we don‚Äôt wanna over shoot on rate hikes so we will look to slow down our hikes in December.‚Äù

This is why we are rallying in my opinion. 

So where does this leave us next week‚Ä¶ well this is the scenarios I forsee. 

Monday and Tuesday I have pinned for a bullish because we really don‚Äôt have anything on the books negative wise. I don‚Äôt forsee anything economic or macro wise to really bring us down and its pretty clear by this weeks movements and recovery that bulls are in control and the markets is not going to sell off (I misplayed that today). 

Wednesday is FOMC day‚Ä¶ I expect a green day. Now the question will be does JPOW rightfully say ‚Äúwe have not controlled inflation and while we do not want to overshoot rate hikes we need to slow inflation first‚Äù if he says this then we should look for a dump into CPI. However, if he says ‚ÄúI believe inflation is tamed and we will see the effects of that on the next CPI and going forward and that should allow us to slow our rate hikes‚Ä¶ slow not pause‚Ä¶‚Äù we are going to rally. 

From there I honestly don‚Äôt forsee CPI coming in as a beat at all.. it actually is going to probably be a huge miss‚Ä¶ if you remember back in August when CPI came in hot they held off on releasing the consensus (just like now) until we got very close to CPI‚Ä¶ I have a feeling after or the day of FOMC we will see the consensus finally released. Which will allow me to accurately predict next CPI‚Ä¶   
 

Regardless of whether we rally or dump after FOMC I expect us to get a bad CPI reading and I will be looking for a repeat of August. What I think is happening is a tactful unwinding of the VIX prior to FOMC and CPI to avoid the crash once again. It seems like this is the general strategy that has happened time and time again. We get these rallies through bad news, and every dip is a buying opportunity where the technical make zero sense (such as this morning where VOLD was extreme bearish and nearly extreme bearish however we saw markets continue to rip). 

In short im bullish till Wednesday then we will take it from there‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/01m9slj18mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5350bfd176464416e90563b10fc4bd5ea7f493

In short SPY has maintained this red bull channel for 2 weeks now and until I see this bull channel broken I will remain bullish. I am seeing today we made a really nice double bottom off 379.8 which also was a daily 8ema support test and hold (this is the big play I over looked today with my bearish bias). In addition we put in a 2 day (almost 3) bullish engulfing daily candle. With maintaining and holding within this green channel and failing to retrace through it I am seeing that a 390.1 resistance test will be coming on Monday. The question is do we level up and push for the 400s before FOMC or do we reject that 390 level Monday and actually spend some time consolidating before FOMC. 

Fun note- this week is now the only the 2nd time this year that markets have put in a green week the week before FOMC the other time was July. 

If and when we break through 390 then I will be looking as the 50% retracement line of the bear channel and start eyeing 405.1 as next level resistance. I am not quite convinced that we will have the steam to get there but I do think we could take 395-400 before FOMC or on FOMC day (if jpow is bullish). 

However, if Monday we reject 390.1 channel resistance I would look for this red bull channel support to be tested and see if that 380 support holds. The one thing to note is that this is the first time a candle has closed over 388.6 since September 22nd.

Funny enough about this weekly candle is that this candle last night was showing a 100% different story. However, todays candle is our 2nd green week in a row and our first back to back green weeks since August. With this candle I look for continuation, however, we did fall just short of breaking through the weekly 20ema. We will need to take that level out then we can start looking at that next major level resistance of 408.9. 

If we double top of the weekly 20ema we could see a retracement back to that 375.6 weekly level. 

Key support- 385.2 -&gt; 375.6 -&gt; 363.7

Futures put in a massive green day today and dead ended right at that 3925 level which just so happens to be its daily 100ema. On the bullish side of things you can see we held the daily 8ema as support today, reconfirmed 3800 as support and broke through the bear channel from August. There is no longer (besides the 2022 bear channel resistance) downward resistance to watch for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Futures actually was able to close over the weekly 20ema. However, as you can see it fell just short of breaking through the orange channel level resistance of 3925. Next week we will look for futures to turn 3925 into support which should open up an opportunity for futes to test next level resistance around 4085. 

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705

Apple put in one hell of an impressive day today making a total intraday movement of $9.68 which was 179% of its 10day average range. It also put in 175% of its 30day average volume today. People poured into Apple today. I think people found their ‚Äúsafe haven.‚Äù

Apple actually broke through its bull channels resistance and topped out right at 157.5 resistance today. With that being where apple hit and retraced we will look for that as key resistance to break over next week. 

This is the first time Apple has closed over the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema since September 12th. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple weekly played perfectly off the levels‚Ä¶ for those who say TA don‚Äôt work or that you cant TA stuff when its parabolic‚Ä¶ today even on a ridiculously big move Apple still respected levels. These chart levels were untouched and it closed right under that key 157.5 weekly level. 

With apple bounced off that red support line, holding 147.2 as support and closing over all the EMAs we should naturally look for some upside next week. 

Key support- 150.6 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 141.2

My love and hate relationship with Tesla is unmatched by anything else. Tesla provided me with 3 huge wins 3 days in a row, however, today I became too bearish and burnt myself playing some level to level plays. Now that I am being more objective I actually see a pretty bullish case for tesla next week. 

We came back down and tested the daily 8ema and managed to close back over that. However, we did fall just short of 230 resistance and the daily 20ema resistance. Tesla looked like it had no sense of direction today and that could have possibly been related to the twitter deal being completed today. 

With this hanging man candle on the daily I am looking for a repeat of 10/24/22 and will look to see a bigger push up on Tesla Monday/ next week. We are right at key resistance for the blue bear channel which lies at 228 for Monday. 

There is a case to be made as I mentioned earlier this week that tesla is establishing a consolidation channel from 205 to 230 and honestly until we close over 230 we haven‚Äôt officially broken that trend yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla still has a daily and weekly gap at 262.47 to fill. I don‚Äôt forsee that filling next week but with a bullish enough sentiment and bullish enough FOMC its not out of the realm of possibilities. Bulls are not trading back over the weekly 50% bear channel retracement mark and will look to turn 2330 turn into support next week. 

Support -204.5 -&gt; 191.7

Resistance- 245 -&gt; 254.7

As I had mentioned I do believe we are seeing the VIX being unwound before FOMC and next CPI. Its generally bad juju to have it over 30 before such events happen. With us clearly trading under the key 28.4 and now under 27 I will look for a the VIX to be near 23.6 to 24.7 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

10% challenge- 

Overall despite finishing green today (bless up tesla) today was not a great day for me. I was too biased bearish and I couldn‚Äôt get a read on the technical today. VOLD (difference of buy/ sell on NYSE) is one of my biggest indicators and biggest check boxes for entering a trade. Today until about 1145am VOLD was not supporting any sort of rallying. IT actually was showing that a huge sell off should have occurred. This also put me overly bearish, however, the charge was led by SPY and tech today and by mid day NYSE jumped on board finally. From there I still took every rejection (consolidation) at key levels as a short opportunity and ended up missing out on some good bull plays. 

Cant win them all and no ones perfect but I look forward to a good weekend to reset my head and trade better next week. This has been a pretty tough 3 days to trade in my opinion. Monday and Tuesday were great though thankfully. 

My Apple put was toasted at open but took a nice win on that Amazon earnings play at open to recoup most of the loss‚Ä¶ apparently I shoulda gone even more OTM as one of the 80s puts on Amazon paid 1k%+ at open.

I have gotten a lot of questions of ‚Äúhow did you go from 6 out of 8 weeks being red to 8 green weeks in a row? ‚ÄúHow is it even possible to go from losing that much to winning like this now?‚Äù 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time‚Ä¶ risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn‚Äôt recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate‚Ä¶ but completely different result‚Ä¶ So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses‚Ä¶ and not increased my win rate or anything else‚Ä¶ I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me ‚Äúwhat did you change?‚Äù ‚Äúits impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!‚Äù ‚Äúits impossible for someone to recover like that!‚Äù

I say no its not‚Ä¶ I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhere was your stop loss?‚Äù   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules‚Ä¶ the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover.

122,1666981669,yfwrlh,1,"I keep hearing the argument that Apple will be displaced because Nokia and Blackberry were.
That they haven‚Äôt innovated since Jobs.

I still think the stock is a great buy and they will continue to dominate.

Anyone who compares Apple to Nokia or Blackberry are foolish. 

It was extremely simple to go from Blackberry to Apple. It‚Äôs not easy for someone to exit Apple‚Äôs ecosystem.

Apple has a ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù approach to their ecosystem. Easy and fun to enter ‚Ä¶ hard and impractical to exit.

Blackberry and Nokia didn‚Äôt have the same reasons to hook people onto their phones and platform for life. 

They made only phones. Apple surrounds your life with as many products as possible all seemingly working with each other.

If you want to switch it‚Äôd be time consuming and annoying. 

You‚Äôd have to figure out how to take all your years of photos from one device to another.

It‚Äôs got over ten years of my health info.
Tons of apps I‚Äôve paid for and use daily that I‚Äôd have to rebuy and resetup on a new platform. Some of those apps don‚Äôt have a real alternative I like on android.

If I bought movies or tv shows on iTunes I‚Äôd lose access to them on any new platform. Or I have Apple services like Apple Card and Apple Wallet that wouldn‚Äôt transfer. 

I‚Äôve got airpods that work solely with my apple products. Not to mention my Mac, Apple TV, Watch and iPad. They all work together. It‚Äôd be huge investment switching. Who can afford it.

No other platform is as seamlessly integrated and ‚Äúwalled off‚Äù. It was a risky idea for a
Apple to attempt it. Probably why no one else had tried it. After all it in some ways prevents people from adopting your product when you don‚Äôt play nice with other platforms. But, now that they pulled it off it‚Äôs perfect.

Is it possible for me to change? ‚Ä¶ sure but it‚Äôd be a pain (time wise) and costlier than just upgrading my iPhone.

If a revolutionary product comes out‚Ä¶ iPhone users are patient enough for Apple to come out with their on spin on it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened so far. Android gets a great new feature and sometimes it takes awhile but iPhone gets something similar.

People have sunken too much investment in terms of time(learning the ins and outs of it) and money into Apple products and services. They probably don‚Äôt want to start from scratch in a different ecosystem.

Apple has been milking that for years.

There‚Äôs always the chance I guess that some company tries to automate the process of switching by giving out free products and services‚Ä¶ automating everything in terms of switching. Giving a customer something amazing to switch.

But, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs feasible. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have tried and failed to crack the nut of competing with the iPhone. It‚Äôd be way too costly.

If anyone could‚Ä¶ maybe Tesla. But, no one is displacing Apple like they did to Blackberry.

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong

  The e-commerce giant posted earnings of $ 0.28 per share, up $ 0.06 while analyst estimates of $ 0.22, quarterly revenue was $ 127.1 billion versus the sums of 127.76 billion dollars. 

 The company founded by Jeff Bezos explained that net sales were adversely affected by $ 5 billion due to changes in exchange rates from the previous year. Operating profit fell to $ 2.5 billion in the quarter, compared to $ 4.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021.

Highlighted this yesterday on futures but im highlighting it today on SPY to make it even more clear. The blue arrows show what looks like a possible top on SPY which should lead to a sell off. I will be looking for an interaction with SPY at 378 support (now resistance after hours). This is the key level that separates the green and grey channels. A breakdown under this support and back into the green channel would signal to me a retest of 360s is coming before we reach 390 resistance. 

This will be the key pivot level to watch tomorrow. If we reject there in the morning or close back below that support of 378 (at this point we do have a gap to fill) then I will be looking for a further sell off next week leading into FOMC and with FOMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will touch on this more tomorrow in the weekly TA but overall SPY, Futures and Apple weekly charts are setting up for a massive failed breakout gravestone doji which should lead to a pretty nice sell off next week. The one caveat with this is that FOMC is next week and that can be a wild card for sure. If it wasn‚Äôt for FOMC id play puts for sure but I will sit cash most likely unless something looks really good. 

Key support- 378.8 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3 -&gt; 370.5

Key resistance- 380 -&gt; 383.1

If you read last nights TA I said that futes most likely would go up and touch 3870 before it rejected just like happened back first week of October. That would then lead to a sell off and we would see a further sell off intraday. Well with this drop after hours its setting up perfectly to see the next leg down leading into FOMC next week. 

With that 3870 rejection and now sitting back under key 3805 support I would look for the 3600s before I look for 3900 again. 

Key support -3770 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3675

Key resistance- 3805 -&gt; 3840

Well there it is‚Ä¶ Apple missed on pretty much everything but china rev lol. So that‚Äôs not very good.. currently only down 4% after hours though. The golden boy lives! The call will be interesting for sure especially since they never give guidance anyways.

To be honest though earnings is a whole none issue for me. Apple today broke through key red bull channel support. This is the same channel that SPY and Futures are holding so far. I will look regardless of what happens for further downside next week. This could be the fuel that markets need to see Apple retest its 52week low finally. If and when that happens I will believe that the temporary bottom is in. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 142.8 -&gt; 141.1

Key resistance- 148

And then there was tesla! So this is one that I am actually most excited about tomorrow at open. I think Tesla is poised for a really nice sell off tomorrow and next week. Tesla went on pretty much a 4 day bounce rally this week and established a super impressive rising wedge and bull channel. However, we say today that we broke out at open touching and rejecting key 234 resistance and then it dumped from there. If you caught that move it was one heck of nice win (granted not as nice as the call win yesterday). With this rising wedge broken I am looking to short tesla at open tomorrow most likely. I think if market remains are red as it is right now and Apple drops tomorrow and the rest of tech including SPY finally then we will see Tesla test that bull channel support. 

Tesla has established a really nice 230 to 205 consolidation channel. I am using the 230 area as a nice opportunity for puts and the 205 area for a nice opportunity for calls. 

Support- 219.2 -&gt; 215.6

Resistance- 225 -&gt; 230 -&gt; 234

Besides the VIX being detached from reality the one thing I am looking at is that we bounced off that previous support of 27 today and closed with a dragonfly doji. This should result in a nice retracement tomorrow which should also result in a nice dump of SPY tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Perhaps technology is destined to be like railway companies of the 19th century. A huge speculative boom and prospects of interconnection, just like how tech is promised to keep on interconnecting. Huge government subsidies (e.g overnment land grants and subsidies to the railroads) vs huge government subsidies (""1 to 2 USD billion per year and that this has been steadily rising over the last years, especially during the Covid-19 period"" [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4149787](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4149787)).

Eventually, this ended when Northern Pacific found itself unable to market several million dollars of bonds. Due to the financial crises in Europe, they couldn't sell the securities abroad. 

Perhaps this case study demonstrates an overeliance on a particular sector to maintain the economy. Too little actual diversification and duplication between companies making the same product (e.g railroad lines being built parrallel to one another vs tech companies making identical social media apps, hardware etc..) 

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared Moore's law dead in 2022 ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618)). This is a huge red flag that technology will no longer keep on getting faster. Silicon is now too small to get much faster as we can no longer build transistors small enough. If a stagnation starts, there is no longer a motive to keep on buying new products as existing products (just like existing railroads) are sufficient. 

There are too many products that may be completely unprofitable, similar to the worthless mortgages of 2008. The cost of Youtube, social media, Spotify, Amazon retail etc... or any online platform where it is free or easy to bypass paywall. For now, they are sustained by the ever-expanding market but if a stagnation occurs, and a recession hits advertisers might try to reign in costs and cut their investment into online platforms, and in order to afford to keep the lights on, online platforms may try to ramp up ads or add a paywall, which would be a lose-lose. 

The dotcom bust of the early 2000s was short and sharp because tech was still not so widely intergrated into the economy and therefore investors didn't have a ""too big too fail"" mentality. Perhaps investors will be in denial for a while before a crash in tech might commense. 

Perhaps the desperation to continue pumping value into the market is why individuals like Elon Musk, who make exciting but erratic suggestions are tolerated. 

What a contrast to the innovations that were methodically tested and implemented steadily over many years (e.g Fairchild Semiconductor, Bell Lab etc...).

Perhaps the market is like a nucleur meltdown, desperate for new innovations to keep up with the runaway market value. The promise (speculation) of hyperloop, widespread space travel to Mars, new battery technology, metaverse is not proven nor methodical and has replaced the value of genuine innovation.

168,1666822917,yeasba,1,"Well today was one wild day that‚Äôs for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a ‚Äúlevel to level‚Äù play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren‚Äôt stopping out too soon (this is why I didn‚Äôt chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key support- 381.6 -&gt; 378.9 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3

Key resistance- 385 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple‚Ä¶. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking.

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough.

Here is a little excerpt to kinda help explain it.

You know those little maps that say ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak‚Ä¶ apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover‚Ä¶ its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3770

Key resistance- 3875 -&gt; 3925

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn‚Äôt very bullish‚Ä¶ 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing‚Ä¶ technically Tesla beat but missed revenue‚Ä¶ its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before‚Ä¶ But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don‚Äôt know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 145.5

Key resistance- 150.9 -&gt; 152.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today‚Ä¶ So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -&gt; 214.4 -&gt; 209.9 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234

As if the VIX couldn‚Äôt become anymore detached from reality‚Ä¶ we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers‚Ä¶ however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That‚Äôs really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn‚Äôt planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it‚Äôs a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

As the world's largest digital advertising company in terms of market share, Google‚Äôs revenue and profits both fell short of expectations, underscoring how the macroeconomic slowdown has hit demand for digital advertising industry.

Google's shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading, dragging down shares of other tech giants with related advertising businesses. Meta, Amazon and Pinterest all fell more than 4%.

Broken down by business, revenue and profit from Google's services business -- its core advertising and search, Android and Chrome browsers, hardware, Google Maps, Google Pay, the Play app store and YouTube video platform -- were weaker than expected

Other Bets, the former tech innovation division that includes self-driving startup Waymo, AI DeepMind, smart healthcare Verily and others, also missed revenue estimates and lost more than expected, with only the cloud business beating both revenue and loss estimates in the third quarter.

Specifically, revenue from search and other related businesses was $39.54 billion, compared with $37.926 billion a year ago, below analysts' expectations of $40.87 billion. YouTube posted $7.071 billion in AD sales, below expectations of $7.47 billion and even lower than $7.205 billion in the same period last year.

180,1666644542,ycm8og,1,"Amazon has frozen hiring in parts of its lucrative web services division ‚Äî an apparent escalation of the company‚Äôs cost-cutting efforts, The Post has learned.

Amazon Web Services ‚Äî the highly profitable division that brought in more than $62 billion in revenue in 2021 ‚Äî has started telling some job candidates that roles they were seeking have been frozen, according to prospective candidates.

On Oct. 4, the New York Times reported that Amazon would stop hiring new corporate employees in its retail and logistics operations ‚Äî but added that AWS was not affected by the freeze.

Some analysts interpreted AWS‚Äô reported exemption as evidence of the division‚Äôs importance within Amazon, where it has been responsible for generating an increasingly large share of the company‚Äôs profits in recent years. Current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy founded and led AWS before he replaced Jeff Bezos as chief executive in 2021 ‚Äî further evidence of the division‚Äôs significance.

But an AWS spokesperson confirmed that parts of the division have stopped hiring new employees.

‚ÄúIn some areas of AWS we have met our hiring needs, and in others we have thousands of job openings,‚Äù the spokesperson told The Post.

The spokesperson did not provide specifics on which areas of AWS have frozen hiring or how many roles were affected.

‚ÄúAcross Amazon, our many different businesses are at various stages of evolution, and we expect to keep adjusting our hiring strategies in each of these businesses at various junctures,‚Äù the spokesperson said. 

While Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce business receives far more attention from consumers, AWS sells so-called cloud computing services that are crucial to the modern internet.

Companies like Netflix and Snapchat are large AWS customers, while rivals like Google and Microsoft have built their own cloud computing services to compete with Amazon. 

Amazon is still planning to  hire roughly 150,000 seasonal workers to deal with this year‚Äôs holiday shipping rush.

Wall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market‚Äôs most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy‚Äôs health.

On the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) ‚Äì which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index ‚Äì will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.

A bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

 

Earnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.

For this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.

Earnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn‚Äôt leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla‚Äôs revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

 

On Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.

Strength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback‚Äôs 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.

That headwind is expected to show up in Amazon‚Äôs results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate‚Äôs revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that ‚Äúforeign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs"" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.

  

For Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted ‚Äúdemand has held up better than expected in recent months.‚Äù

Meta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech‚Äôs 72-hour earnings rollout.

In economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings ‚Äì which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER‚Äôs panel of economists must officially declare a recession.

Economic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

 

According to Pantheon Economics‚Äô Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.

‚ÄúBut the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,‚Äù Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",Yahoo Finance Big Tech earnings and GDP data,1.0,2022-10-24 02:46:56

For almost a year they have been working on selling a stake/separating their assets (Lionsgate studio and Starz) to unlock value. The most recent release of information indicates a deal is still on and, IMO will be announced before March 2023. Also, bets on call options that expire early next year could be lucrative if a deal is in fact announced before then. Below is a synopsis of why I think the stock is worth at least $20/share. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lionsgate‚Äôs market cap, as of October 21st, 2022, is just over $1.7 Billion. The company owns the Lionsgate brand (studio) which produces and distributes movies and TV shows, and Starz, a subscription service with over 37 million subscribers (which the company hopes to increase to 50 million by 2025). Starz was bought by Lionsgate in 2016 for $4.4 Billion but the acquisition has not gone as planned. Hence the separation.

On November 4th, 2021, Lionsgate told shareholders that they are observing strategic alternatives for Starz.

&amp;#x200B;

They were looking for a full or partial spin off in order to have the market fully recognize and value both divisions. When news broke, the stock rallied to $17/share. That gave the company a market value of approximately $3.8 Billion, with no final valuation or concrete interest. The rise was simply due to the company stating their intent to consider. The stock is currently trading at $7.73/share with a market cap of over $1.7 Billion. Down about 50% from the rally that came after the spin-off announcement, even while demand for content and subscribers has been increasing. From November 4th, 2021, till today, the company has reiterated on numerous occasions that they intend to notify shareholders of the separation by the end of summer, with a deal closing as early as early next year. We heard it throughout the year on quarterly/conference calls. Although the end of summer deadline has passed, the company has still reiterated the separation. 

On September 28th, 2022, an 8-k was filed which indicated that the company was focusing more on selling a stake in Lionsgate's studio business as opposed to selling a stake in Starz. This makes more sense as the studio is significantly more valuable than Starz.

Link here: [https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/lionsgate1/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=16102825&amp;Cik=0000929351&amp;Type=PDF&amp;hasPdf=1](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/lionsgate1/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=16102825&amp;Cik=0000929351&amp;Type=PDF&amp;hasPdf=1)

&amp;#x200B;

So, why does this mean Lionsgate‚Äôs a bargain now? It‚Äôs a bargain because we‚Äôre at the point where we have a general idea of how much Lionsgate's assets (studio and Starz) could be worth. With an emphasis on the studio business. 

Let‚Äôs start with the Starz valuation. In 2019 CBS made an ‚Äúinformal offer‚Äù of $5 Billion for Starz, which Lionsgate declined. I don‚Äôt believe Starz is worth anywhere near $5 Billion. I‚Äôd be content with a $3 Billion valuation ($2 Billion + $1 Billion in assumed debt). 

Lionsgate‚Äôs studio business is what interests me the most. The best way to value the studio is to look at comparables. Since there aren‚Äôt many, the one we‚Äôll focus on is MGMs sale to Amazon. This has been validated by the CEO. On the August 4th, 2022 earnings call, in response to an analyst‚Äôs question, Lionsgate‚Äôs CEO said ‚Äú‚Ä¶understand that the immense value that we have is really after the MGM sale to Amazon, but really the only real actionable investable studio. And you know, again, MGM, if that‚Äôs a comp, there you go, use that. Our library honestly is better than the MGM library‚Äù. 

MGM was sold for $8.5 Billion and here we have Lions Gates CEO telling shareholders, and potential buyers, that he believes Lionsgate‚Äôs studio business is worth similar to what Amazon paid for MGM. I hope he‚Äôs right and that value is recognized but I doubt it. I‚Äôm going to cut the potential price for Lionsgate‚Äôs studio business to $6 Billion ($5 Billion + $1 Billion assumed debt). 

So, we have Starz worth a projected $3 Billion and Lionsgate (Studio) at a $6 Billion valuation. This gives us a company worth $9 Billion or a $7 Billion market cap. The current market cap is, again, slightly over $1.7 Billion. 

Due to recent economic uncertainties, we can go ahead and cut the potential valuations for both the studio business AND Starz AGAIN and still have room for a significant return. If we cut the valuations to $5 billion for the studio ($4bill + $1 bill debt) and $2.5 Billion for Starz ($1.5 bill + $1 bill debt), we would still have a value of $7.5 billion, or a $5.5 billion market cap. The studio at a $5 Billion valuation is a whopping 40% reduction from the value the CEO was discussing when comparing us to MGM.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, lets look at the worst-case scenario. Even if a deal isn‚Äôt announced, the company will most likely be acquired (in part or full) in the near future. However, the 8-k issued on September 28th, 2022, yet again reiterated the separation and interest despite recent market volatility. 

I think the entire company is worth at least $20/Share, including Starz. This is a valuation based on the assets/sum of parts. It doesn‚Äôt take into account the management team or potential future earning power. In fact, I don‚Äôt trust the management team one bit, especially after they failed to reach a deal in the time frame they said. I do, however, trust the interest potential acquirers have for Lionsgate‚Äôs content and IP (17,000 movies and tv episodes). Especially during times when streamers want to boost their library. 

The likely outcome is Lionsgate separates from Starz and sells a stake in the studio. Once separated the new company, Lionsgate Studio, can sell a stake to acquirers. Say 25% at a value, including debt of $5 Billion ($4 Billion market cap and $1 Billion of debt on the balance sheet). This would immediately inject $1 Billion into the company and give shareholders stock worth an additional $3 billion. This doesn‚Äôt even include any value from Starz.

&amp;#x200B;

If this specific scenario plays out, then the following should occur: 

Lionsgate studios stock price: $17.50/share

Starz stock price: $6.50/share

Total value: $24/share

The valuations used are the $4 Billion for the studio and $1.5 Billion for Starz.

For simplicities sake I‚Äôm going to use the same number of shares outstanding Lionsgate currently has which is approximately 228,515,306.

&amp;#x200B;

For those interested in options, the options market is pricing calls with expirations ranging from December 2022 to March 2023 incredibly cheaply. These could become hugely profitable if a deal is announced before the expirations. I've seen potential returns of up to 10x, however I advise you look for yourself and come to your own conclusions. 

**Key notable events**

\*November 4th, 2021: Management states their intent to spin off/separate Starz and Lionsgate studio, stock rallies to over $17/share\*

\*February 4th, 2022: Management reiterated their intent and discussed how talks are progressing\*

\*May 26th, 2022: CEO states that they intend to have a deal announced by the end of summer 2022\*

\*August 4th, 2022: Management says the initiative is still on track and has even broadened to include the studio\*

\*September 7th, 2022: Lionsgate‚Äôs Vice chairman goes to a BOA conference and reaffirms the separation and equity stake sale. He reiterates that he expects a deal to be announced by the end of summer, saying he‚Äôs very encouraged with potential partners. He goes on to say he thinks ‚Äúshareholders are going to be very happy with the outcome‚Äù \* 

\*September 28th, 2022: The end of summer deadline has passed and the company files an 8-k stating the separation is still progressing with more of an emphasis on the studio\* 

\*November 3rd, 2022: Quarterly results are going to be published. It‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll get more information on the separation. It‚Äôs also entirely possible a deal gets announced on the call considering the missed deadline\*

The second estimate showed that the economy contracted at a 0.6% annual rate in the April-through-June period, a slower pace than the 0.9% decline initially estimated, driven in part by an upward revision of consumer spending.

China‚Äôs National Bureau of Statistics and S&amp;P Global release September surveys of purchasing managers about economic activity in China‚Äôs manufacturing sector. China‚Äôs agency also releases a separate survey measuring the country‚Äôs nonmanufacturing sector.

# TL;DR

I'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:  

1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.
2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**  
3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble. 
4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone. 
5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.  
6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do. 
7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)

You see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.

Tesla Q3 '22 EPS - $1.05

Tesla Q3 '21 EPS - $.48

Tesla TTM eps $3.33. At the current SP of $208 (after hours), that puts PE ratio at 62. Down almost 20 points from it's current PE due to earnings growth. 

Meta - Between Q3 '21 and Q2 '22, EPS have declined by 23%, with an even bigger decline YOY once their Q3 earnings come out.

Amazon - Q3 '21 eps were $0.31 and Q2 '22 eps were negative (-0.20). Maybe they'll get some support from Rivian SP going up around 30% between beginning Q3 and end of Q3, but their operating margins are still lousy in this inflationary environment. They're up against a tough comparison for Q3 '21 so their TTM EPS will likely further decrease, pushing up their PE ratio and putting pressure on share price.

Google - EPS have decreased from $1.40 in Q3 '21 to $1.20 for Q2 '22. We'll have to see what Q3 brings, but likely it'll be less than the $1.4 eps they made in Q3 '21.

Solomon spoke after his firm had just posted quarterly earnings results that beat Wall Street estimates.

195,1666154162,y7sx4o,1,"So was Netflix earnings good? 

In short, yes and no. Bleeding has been stemed but they are vulnurable. 

Why does this matter? Because if you can remember things for longer than 10 seconds this stock is worth watching. 

Firstly, [learn where investor letters are](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/FINAL-Q3-22-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) and read them. You can bet your fucking ass big boys do. The headline shit is for you idiots. 

So lets talk about the three things you read in a headline, probably didn't understand but still got a half chub about. Here is what you saw:

**Revenue:** $7.93 billion versus $7.85 billion expected

**Adj. earnings per share (EPS):** $3.10 versus $2.22 expected

**Subscriber net additions:** +2.41 million versus +1 million estimated

What does this mean and why do we care.

**Big Beat on Memberships**

This was likely the most important investors were looking at, even when you look at it in better detail it was okay not great.

Now there are four major geographic locations they break down Memberships; I am going to list them by highest value (ARM - Average Revenue per Membership).

UCAN (US/Canada) - $16.37 ARM [12% Y/Y Growth] - 100k New Paid Memberships after losing 1.94M Q1-Q2

EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa) - $10.81 ARM [-7% Y/Y Growth] - 570k New Paid Memberships after losing 1.07M Q1-Q2

LATAM (Latin America) - $8.58 ARM [9% Y/Y Growth] - 310k New Paid Memberships after losing 350k in Q1

APAC (Asia Pacific) - $8.34 ARM [-13% Y/Y Growth] - 1.43M New Paid Memberships with only growth so far in 2022

WELL WHAT DOES THIS MEAN. Simple they stopped losing users in every single market. Are they net down users? Oh yeah big time, but the bleeding stopped. That was what mattered this stock got fucking slaughtered down to a P/E ratio of 21.42 going into earnings and is cashflow positive with still large market share. If you rushed into this hoping for nEtFliX fUcKeD puts you deserved to lose money only way down was with continued loss of users. 

But it wasn't great. Their most valuable members (UCAN) aren't growing and after losing 1.94M of their most valuable memberships even with their ""hits"" they listed they only brought back 100k paid memberships. That is not a good look. They did recover better in EMEA still down net memberships; but due to F/X (Foreign Exchange) and the fact this does include Africa/Middle East which already had not F/X their ARM is dropping meaning these accounts are becoming less valuable. LATAM was pretty much as wash on members but ARM did improve. Now APAC is where this really blew up new memberships allowing for such a bullish headline print and accounting for ~60% of new memberships unfortunately is also the least valuable accounts and has seen a -13% decrease in ARM; this is mainly India which is no secret they are trying to get into more. 

So to recap; investors wanted to see no more decline in users in this sense that was achieved. The adoption in LATAM and APAC was definetely bullish although with F/X troubles &amp; impact of inflation on the value of USD (eventually OPEX catches up) their revenue is pretty much flat even with membership growth. Not great but that can improve with F/X in the future. What wasn't great was how weakly UCAN and EMEA have recovered and how EMEA is seeing a decline in their ARM with F/X and demographics. **This is a weakness to watch for in their upcoming Q4. If their ""smashing hits"" of 2022 only brought back 100k of their most valuable members if this drops now into Q4 it will severely hurt their revenue**. In fact if you look at their forward guidance you might think ""weird Netflix you predict another net 4.5M paid memberships but again only a revenue of 7.8B? The same as this Q4"". Yeah thats foreboding, they know where their growth is and F/X is fucking it. 


** Revenue Beat **

I will be short and sweet. Pretty much barely $7.93 billion versus $7.85 billion expected is within error tolerance. Sure it technically beat but other than giving another beat to a headline this was not that interesting. If anything with the suprise beat on paid members this not being a bigger beat says alot about how the new members are in non ideal F/X. They predict Q4 revenue to again come in at 7.8B even with new memberships. F/X getting ugly. 

**So what to take away from this? Well as long as the USD keeps big dicking down everyone else their revenue is going to hurt faster as their user growth is not really in strong currencies. In fact as we get into our last section currency is the name of the game going into Q4. If USD weakens by Q4 expect a suprise beat in revenue if it strengthes a miss is possible or a revised earnings prior**.

** Earnings Per Share Beat **

$3.10 versus $2.22 expected

This one was a little interesting. I see they decided to try take some fun accounting tricks (completely legal you fucking mAnIpuLaTiON nerds). One might think if their revenue was expected how was EPS then such a good beat? Well you little illiterate fuck that is a good question. There are two main parts:

- Cost Control: They lowered their OPEX. Good for them. But this wasn't the big item. Although I think they are getting a little loose on how they try to ""interpret"" with out F/X in some cases.... but not huge. 

- Non-Cash Unrealized Gain: Oh these slithery snakes. Took a page out of the book from Amazon-Rivian and gave themselves a 348M credit to their bottom line in the unrealized non-cash gain against their Euro denominated debt. What does this mean? Simple you regard you. Because USD gained on Euro and they have debt they own in Euros that debt is cheaper. Personally, I think this is in a little bad taste given how they right before this went on about how they like to look at their finances ""not through the lens of F/X"". Except for when it helps huh? Well what this did was turn otherwise small beat of 2.33 EPS to that rip-roaring 3.10 eps.

Clever girl. Now there is nothing illegal about this; but like how Amazon used it to make their ER look better at a critical time it could also like Amazon bite them in the ass later (or continue to help).

**So why do you fucking care? Simple. Again follow USD-Euro and USD general strength going into Q4. If the Euro claws back they will have to report that as an impairment against their earnings. On the flip side a continued decline of the Euro will alow them to continue to give themselves this to their bottom line to offset other F/X impacts.**


*WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN**

In summary. Netflix earnings were what investors were looking for. Although they aren't seeing growth or even a return of their high value customers the bleeding did stop. They are particularly getting fucked in F/X. Continued USD strength will severely impact their bottom line as their parity currency customer UCAN is not really growing. The only 100k return of their UCAN customers with their ""big hits"" is also weak. So they are very very vulnurable right now. Going into Q4 watch that F/X like a hawk because it might dictate their future. Of course if there is no more good content to draw or retain UCAN users that will be a blood bath as well.

How to make money? I wouldn't go short in the near term. They were already heavily oversold and they saw net additions across all regions. Maybe macro might drag it up/down but I doubt investors saw anything they will run tomorrow from. If USD keeps going crazy the big boys will be thinking about F/X on this stock in their mind and that might be a good time to get short dated puts and ride it down a little.

But the big ticket is Q4. If you can remember long enough (I might even repost this closer to Q4 with updates) check out that F/X because it will dicate life. If USD still on steriods go short; if USD on steroids but Euro also clawed back that is the worst case scenario for them because they revenue will hurt and they will have to report an impairment.

The U.S. economy could be heading for a recession in the next year, according to growing warnings from banks and economists, as a sudden bout of pessimism hammers financial markets, which on Thursday spiraled further from recent highs.

Although major swaths of the economy ‚Äî including the job market and consumer spending ‚Äî remain robust, there are mounting worries that rising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, after years of near-zero interest rates, could cause a sudden retrenchment. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points so far this year, while officials are signaling more aggressive increases could be necessary to cool the economy. Continued uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine are adding to the uneasiness.

Financial markets fell again on Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst drop of the year. The S&amp;P 500 inched further into bear market territory ‚Äî defined as a 20 percent drop from the most recent peak ‚Äî after Wednesday‚Äôs sell-off wiped out more than 4 percent of its value.

‚ÄúRecession risks are high ‚Äî uncomfortably high ‚Äî and rising,‚Äù said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics. ‚ÄúFor the economy to navigate through without suffering a downturn, we need some very deft policymaking from the Fed and a bit of luck.‚Äù

Nations move to tackle inflation, increasing risk to global economy

This week alone, former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein warned of a ‚Äúvery, very high risk‚Äù of recession; Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said there was ‚Äúno question‚Äù that the U.S. economy is heading toward a downturn; and former Fed chair Ben Bernanke cautioned that the country could be poised for ‚Äústagflation‚Äù ‚Äî a slowing economy combined with high inflation.

Those concerns come amid a smattering of data that points to economic cooling, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors that are already feeling the brunt of the Fed‚Äôs promise to keep tightening monetary conditions. New home construction slowed in April. Mortgage demand continues to decline.

Some of the country‚Äôs largest and most influential retailers reported disappointing sales and profits this week because of higher costs and overstocked inventory issues, engineered to avoid supply chain disruptions, setting off a stock market meltdown. Walmart stock plunged more than 11 percent on Tuesday, its worst one-day loss in 35 years. On Wednesday, Target shares tumbled 26 percent, following a stunning 52 percent drop in quarterly profits, which executives attributed in part to cooling demand for big-ticket items such as TVs, kitchen appliances and outdoor furniture.

Fed hikes rates by half a percentage point in fight against inflation

‚ÄúWhile we anticipated a post-stimulus slowdown in these categories ‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt anticipate the magnitude of that shift,‚Äù Brian Cornell, Target‚Äôs chief executive, said in a Wednesday earnings call. ‚ÄúWhen we talk to our guests, they often express their concerns about a host of rapidly changing conditions, ranging from geopolitics to the high and persistent inflation they‚Äôve been experiencing.‚Äù

Goldman Sachs this week revised down its forecast for second-quarter U.S. economic growth, to an annualized rate of 2.5 percent, citing higher prices and continued supply chain disruptions. That follows an unexpected contraction in the first three months of 2022, when the economy shrank at a 1.4 percent pace, mostly because of a trade imbalance and a drop in inventory purchases.

Economy shrinks 1.4% in first 3 months of year, raising recession fear

International turmoil, including a risk of recession in Europe and China, is dimming the outlook for the U.S. economy. And a strengthening U.S. dollar ‚Äî as rate increases make dollar investments more attractive ‚Äî could dampen exports, raising the chances of a technical recession in which the economy contracts for two quarters in a row.

That fear of a souring economy as well as shifts in consumer pandemic spending habits have led some highflying tech darlings including Netflix and Peloton to announce layoffs in recent weeks. Twitter and Meta have paused hiring plans, while Amazon executives recently said the company was ‚Äúoverstaffed‚Äù after months of brisk hiring. National claims for unemployment insurance inched up to 218,000 last week, a four-month high although still near historic lows.

Meanwhile, inflation, which remains near 40-year highs, has become a central challenge for both the economy and the Biden administration. Higher prices for basics like food, energy and housing are straining Americans‚Äô budgets and clouding their view of the economy. Gas prices soared to yet another all-time high this week, with average prices hitting $4.57 per gallon nationwide. A closely watched consumer sentiment index by the University of Michigan shows that Americans‚Äô views of their current finances and future expectations have fallen sharply in the past year.

Despite that gloomy outlook, Americans continue to spend heartily. Sales of clothing, cars and furniture all ticked up in April, contributing to a 0.9 percent increase in overall retail sales from a month earlier, according to Commerce Department data released this week.

‚ÄúNear term, the U.S. economy is holding up rather well despite the trouble abroad and the high prices at the checkout stand,‚Äù said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist for S&amp;P Global, who says there‚Äôs a 35 percent risk of recession in the next year. ‚ÄúPeople are spending, businesses are still trying to hire. But there are certainly challenges ahead. The Fed‚Äôs actions will slow the economy, but the question is whether they could also topple the apple cart.‚Äù

A day after warning that slower growth and inflation are ‚Äúhaving stagflationary effects,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said Thursday she is optimistic the central bank could contain inflation without causing a recession. But she acknowledged that the ability to do so was far from clear.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs conceivable there could be a soft landing. It requires both skill and luck ‚Ä¶ I hope that‚Äôs the case, but this is a very difficult economic situation,‚Äù Yellen told reporters in Germany, citing economic shocks from the war and sanctions on Russia. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot going on. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not a straightforward matter.‚Äù

Even if the United States staves off a recession in the short term, some economists say the sheer pace of inflation, with prices up 8.3 percent in the past year, and the persistent supply-and-demand imbalances caused by the pandemic, and the policy responses to it, could snowball into an even more severe crisis down the line.

‚ÄúConsumers are spending like crazy, businesses are going to need to rebuild their inventories, and a lot of workers are still flowing back into the labor market,‚Äù said Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University who served as an adviser during the Obama administration. ‚ÄúBut all of this makes me worry about one or two or three years from now ‚Äî because it might mean the Fed needs to raise rates even more, and it might mean you create an even bigger recession later.‚Äù

Zandi, of Moody‚Äôs, said rising gas and commodity prices from pandemic-related supply chain snarls and the conflict in Ukraine have added to the specter of an economic downturn. He now puts the odds of a U.S. recession in the next 24 months at about 50 percent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre traveling very close to the edge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe housing market is the next thing that‚Äôs going to roll over; the question is just how hard.‚Äù

New home construction fell in April, led by a slowdown in single-family homes. Building permits, which offer a glimpse into future construction, also declined, according to data released this week by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

‚ÄúHome builder sentiment fell to the lowest level in two years in May,‚Äù Yelena Maleyev, an economist for Grant Thornton, said in an analyst note. ‚ÄúBuilders are seeing less foot traffic and expect sales to be softer as we enter the busy home-buying season.‚Äù

Mortgage rates are rising, but the hot housing market is slow to cool

That softening is already rippling through the economy. Major mortgage lenders across the country, including Wells Fargo and Better.com, have laid off thousands in recent weeks as a result of dwindling demand for home loans and refinancing.

In Alexandria, Va., mortgage lender Kevin Retcher said there is a discernible skittishness among potential home buyers. Refinances began tumbling late last year, around the time the Fed began signaling upcoming rate increases. In the months since, a combination of rising mortgage rates ‚Äî now at 5.3 percent for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage, nearly double early 2021 levels ‚Äî and sky-high home prices have begun deterring buyers, he said. At least three clients have gotten ‚Äúcold feet‚Äù and pulled out of ratified contracts in the past two weeks, he added.

‚ÄúThere is an extreme sense of nervousness out there,‚Äù said Retcher, president of First Meridian Mortgage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rare to have people win contracts and then back out, but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening.‚Äù

Other types of small businesses say they‚Äôre seeing a pullback in consumer demand, too, as customers grapple with rising costs. Aaron Mulherin, who owns a glass repair company in Marion, Iowa, said that while homeowners are continuing to pay for necessities such as fixing broken windows, they‚Äôre starting to think twice about spending on luxuries such as custom showers.

‚ÄúAverage, middle-class consumers are starting to hesitate,‚Äù Mulherin said. ‚ÄúEverything is getting more expensive, so they‚Äôre getting an estimate, then putting it off.‚Äù","U.S. may be barreling toward recession in next year, more experts say ‚ÄòRecession risks are high ‚Äî uncomfortably high ‚Äî and rising,‚Äô a leading economist says",1.0,2022-10-17 06:34:19

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington‚Äôs most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in [a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653?mod=article_inline)from 2016 to 2021.

Key Excerpt:

AMONG THE JOURNAL‚ÄôS FINDINGS:   

* While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon. com Inc. 
* More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.
* More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.
* At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies. 
* About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.  
* When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency‚Äôs work.",WSJ: Government Officials Invest in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,1.0,2022-10-11 15:15:18

Rivian Automotive, Inc. is another EV manufacturer focused on pickups and SUVs. The company was founded in 2009 and is based in San Jose-California. 

Rivian is among the greenest of the EV makers choosing to achieve carbon neutrality well ahead of the Paris Climate Accord timeline. Rivian Automotive went public in 2021.
The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric adventure vehicles and accessories through direct sales to consumers and commercial markets. 

Lets dig deeper into the details of this company,
Like other EV companies, Rivian did not achieve profits.  Rivian launched its first car at the end of 2021 and said that it will start manufacturing at the end of this year.  The company's stock price is currently at 30 to 40 USD per share for two main reasons: it has secured $700 million in investments from Amazon and another $500 million investment from Ford and cooperation with Ford to develop EVs under the Ford brand (a great idea from the dinosaurs at Ford to buy a stake in the EV company and benefit from its expertise)  However, the partnership with Amazon is expected to be very fruitful because Amazon has stated that it will have 100,000 electric vans for delivery by the year 2040, and this has given this company a great value as any startup that combines the names of large companies with it in addition to the use of a great PR team can make the stock soar in the sky even if the company has negative cash flows, as the initial public offering of Revan is considered one of the greatest in the history of the US and during difficult conditions in the pandemic and a state of uncertainty, Add to that, recently Rivian signed a memorandum  An understanding with the German car maker, Mercedes-Benz, to cooperate in the field of electric vans. 

Rivian reported in a July 6 SEC filing that it produced 4,401 vehicles in the second quarter, an increase of 72% from the previous quarter.  4,467 vehicles delivered, an increase of 264% from the first quarter.  RIVN stock jumped 11% on the good news.

  In the first quarter of the year, Rivian produced 2,553 vehicles, including a mix of the Rivian R1T pickup truck, R1S SUV, and commercial trucks destined for its flagship customer Amazon.  1,227 vehicles were delivered in the first quarter.


  The company reiterated that it is on track to meet its production target of 25,000 EVs for 2022, but that's half its original estimate of 50,000, which indicates that the company is overburdening itself and if it fails to deliver on its promise could severely affect the company's stock.

  Production challenges that Rivian faced earlier this year forced the electric vehicle maker to review its promises and expectations, and Rivian says it does not expect it to be profitable for the foreseeable future.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from its initial public offering for working capital, growth financing and other general corporate purposes.

CEO Scaringe said at the Wolfe Research conference on February 24 that ramping up production at Rivian's Normal plant is ""definitely making progress,"" but supply chain issues are still slowing production.
Mr. Scaringi said the global shortage of semiconductor chips was the ""most painful"" obstacle to increasing production.

In my personal view, If Rivian can implement its plans and expand further, we are looking at the biggest competitor to Tesla in the future","Rivian Automotive, Inc. DD",1.0,2022-10-07 05:47:59

228,1664903304,xvkmp4,1,"ore than a hundred Amazon workers staged a walkout, refusing to return to work after a fire broke out at a warehouse in New York City.

Christian Smalls, the president of the Amazon Labor Union, said night shift workers at the Amazon JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island were demanding to be sent home with pay after a fire broke out at the facility on Monday.

""After a raging fire on ship dock 500 plus workers sat in the break room demanding to be sent home with pay for safety due to the smoke,"" he wrote on Twitter early on Tuesday.

""@amazonlabor Lead organizers are now Marching on the Boss with hundreds of workers!""

Smalls also shared a video on Twitter showing the fire at the facility, in which a worker can be heard yelling ""evacuate.""

""Yet Amazon refuses to let Night Shift be excused with pay,"" Smalls tweeted, adding that the ""burnt chemicals from the compactor still linger by docks.""

""Hundreds of workers want to go home. Amazon will be held accountable,"" he said

Amazon spokesperson Paul Flaningan said a small fire broke out at a compactor that breaks down cardboard boxes at the facility on Monday, but that the New York Fire Department had certified the building as safe.

""Yesterday afternoon there was a small fire in a cardboard compactor outside of JFK8, one of our facilities in Staten Island, New York,"" Flaningan said in a statement to Newsweek.

""All employees were safely evacuated, and day shift employees were sent home with pay. The FDNY certified the building is safe and at that point we asked all night shift employees to report to their regularly scheduled shift. While the vast majority of employees reported to their workstations, a small group refused to return to work and remained in the building without permission.""

Derrick Palmer, the vice president of the Amazon Labor Union, said workers were refusing to work their night shift because they were worried about fumes from the fire.

Palmer said a manager threatened workers with write-ups if they didn't return to work, according to Noam Scheiber, a labor reporter for The New York Times.

Earlier, Amazon management reportedly placed hundreds of workers in the facility's cafeteria but did not immediately inform them if they would be going home or back to work.

""A lot of workers have been saying they need to send us home and with pay; some are saying that now is the time to strike,"" a night shift worker told journalist Jordan Chariton.

""There's been lots of agitation and conversations talking about being exploited by the bosses and this is typical Amazon, typical corporate failure to take care of their employees.""

The action comes after workers at the Staten Island warehouse made history by voting to unionize on April 1, establishing the retailer's first organized facility in the U.S.

Amazon had sought to overturn the vote, saying the union had acted improperly and has continued to resist unionization efforts at other facilities.

Smalls, the Amazon Labor Union and Amazon have been contacted for further comment.

229,1664831601,xuvnl1,1,"Thesis: As technology has evolved, we as a society have become more and more reliant on instant gratification. Whether it be getting that butt plug from Amazon in less than 24 hours, or having someone else drive to the restaurant 5 minutes down the street from your apartment instead of doing it yourself and waiting in line, we now live in a time of instant gratification. I believe this has had an effect on our attention spans, as far as how long we are willing to wait for something to happen. Now how does this relate to the markets? Well first it means whenever a crash does happen, wether that happens in this recession or not, we now think in a completely different manner than we did in any other crash. Waiting 5 minutes for things to happen seems like a lifetime to us. I think we are seeing that play out in the market right now. If you look at the S&amp;P500 for the last year, the market will go down for about a month, then the next month go back up almost to the same high but not quiet as high, all before going down for another month. I believe that what is happening is this instant gratification impulse is changing the market dynamics in that we aren‚Äôt going to wait for a crash. From what I can see it appears that we‚Äôre giving a coming crash about a month, then when it doesn‚Äôt happen in that short time frame we collectively go, ‚ÄúNah that‚Äôs not going to happen, it would have already done it.‚Äù We‚Äôll see how it continues to play out, but I do think there is something to this.",Attention Spans and Market Crashes 2022 Edition,1.0,2022-10-03 21:13:21

233,1664515396,xrt4xq,1,"#History for the Play
Most of this play is based on the Breath of the Wild 1 release and how The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been designed and built, so it's important to understand the history of the BotW1.

BotW1 was one of the biggest releases of all time. It sold 1.5 million copies in the first week. As of today, it sits as number four on the list of most purchased Nintendo titles. IGN listed BotW1 as number one in their list of top 100 games of all time in 2021. *This game was f'n nominated for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards Choice Video Game award, ffs.* It didn't win, but, I mean, it lost to Fortnite, so...

Another piece of the play relies on the popularity of a couple of titles in Japan, as well as the overall popularity of Nintendo in Japan. First of all, Splatoon 3. This game is a behemoth somehow. If you'll recall, BotW1 was one of the biggest releases of all time, holding the number twenty-six spot on this list of 50 best-selling video games: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games. BotW1 hit 1.5 million sold in the first week. Splatoon 3, released on 9.9.22, hit 3.45 million copies sold in the first week. It passed the most recent Pokemon game quickly and Nintendo shares jumped 5.5%. It passed BotW1 by something like 450k copies on the first day, I believe. So, Nintendo has made a lot of money on this game already, and it's poised to be one of the biggest releases they've ever done.

And finally, there's a game not a lot of people are familiar with. Dragon Quest X: Rise of the Five Tribes **Offline** released 9.15.22. This game is a Japan exclusive created by Square Enix. So, how does that help us? Well, Switch is, by far, the most popular console to play this game on. Apparently, it's a pretty big deal in Japan, so Nintendo is getting a bit of a boost there as well.

#The Hardware
Consoles are hurting. All sales on consoles are down. My understanding is that this is related to the semiconductor shortage. Even still, the Switch is outperforming all the other consoles. I can't find the link where I found this data, but the data is recent. I know because Playstation announced that it is increasing the price of PS5s pretty much worldwide: https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2022/08/ps5-price-increase-confirmed-for-uk-europe-japan-canada-and-more

Nintendo, on the other hand, reported almost at the same time both in Europe and Japan that they had no plans to increase their console prices: 
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62659688
https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-says-there-s-no-plans-to-increase-switch-price-in-japan

Based on my current research, here are some relative prices on Switch OLED vs PS5:
*Europe -&gt; Switch OLED: 314.99 -&gt; PS5: 550.00
*Japan -&gt; Switch OLED: 38000 yen -&gt; PS5: 50000 yen
*US -&gt; Switch OLED: $349 on Amazon, at your doorstep in two days -&gt; PS5: cheapest I could find was $449; $499.99 on Prime

#Why is Breath of the Wild 2 (aka Tears of the Kingdom) important?
Fiscal Year 2024 (84th fiscal year) release - post March, 2023
Breath of the Wild 1 was a gigantic release. There's not many people on earth who haven't heard of it. When they were making DLC for BotW1, they found that they had too many ideas for stuff, so they piled all that stuff on the cutting room floor and built a new game out of it. Basically what that means is that they're re-releasing BotW1 with new content and probably a new-ish world. The same graphics and mechanics and etc can be expected. So as long as they don't fuck up the story and the world, it should be a popular game that sees an even more profound launch than BotW1.

#Important Company Dates:
Recorded interim for 83rd fiscal year on 9.30.22
Scheduled 10 to 1 split on 10.1.22
Dividends paid twice per year: end of 2nd quarter and fiscal year-end
8.3.22 earnings was three months into fiscal year, so it only included 3 months of Splatoon 3 release time
10.8.22 earnings is 6 months into fiscal year


#Notable Release Dates
*Splatoon 3 - 9.9.22
*Bayonetta 3 - 10.28.22 (may be good, may be bad)
*Pokemon Scarlet and Violet edition OLED Model - 11.4.22
*Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet - 11.18.22
*Fire Emblem Engage - 1.20.23 (may be really good, may be meh)
*Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe - 2.24.23 (Kirby is always popular)
*The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - 5.12.23 **The main part of the play, and effectively the end of our safely expected gains.**

**A screenshot of my research notes:**
https://imgur.com/a/6eFklFI

#TL;DR: The Play:
*Dumped all my other stocks for a loss like an OG
*Put all my money into Nintendo stock to carry
*Tried to get in before the split but think I missed it
*Sit on these stocks and buy more as I can
*Take gains on earnings as I expect them to be up
*Take gains on releases
*Take gains after earnings after BotW2 release 2024
*Maybe dip, maybe hodl

#Risk:
Tears of the Kingdom may not be as good as BotW1. If not, the higher end of my hopes for this play are probably dashed. But, even so, we can probably still expect pretty solid gains from Nintendo between now and March 2023.

The numbers: DKS is rock hard - float is 40 million shares, shares short is 15 million, short percent of float is 38% (9/28/22 Yahoo Finance, the short number varies depending where you check), profit margin 10% (yes actually fuckin' profitable), P/E is 9, $317 million in FCF on $8 billion market cap, $1.9 billion cash and $4.4 billion in debt, beat estimates last 4 quarters.  


The squeeze: DKS is 24% short (marketbeat 9/15/22), 8.2 days to cover, 350k shares available (IBKR 9/26), big shorts include Calamos (neutral income fund) 676,000 shares short around $99 and Diamond Hills (long short fund) 130,000 shares short around $76.¬† Dick's is trading in its upper range - this is when you bust the shorts.  


Just the tip: DKS just had their ""signing day"" hiring 9000 seasonal workers.¬† DKS raised, yes raised, guidance for the rest of the year on their last earnings.  


Post Covid: shorts think Dick's is going down like Peloton, but DKS isn't a one trick pony.¬† People left gyms and started exercising outside and playing sports, that's more customers for DKS.¬† Youth sports is back, more customers.¬† Fuckin' pickle ball playing boomers, more customers.¬† People want to be outside, people need Dick's.¬† Ironically Peloton announced they're going to sell their bikes at Dick's today!  


Inflation: Dick's is inflation proof.¬† The margin on shoes is 42%, DKS sells a shit ton.¬† How much is a football?¬† Fucked if I know, but if you need one, you're buying one, inflation isn't changing my mind.¬†  


Competition: Almost none.¬† All the other nationwide sporting goods companies went under during Covid. Dick's grew to 730 stores.¬† Amazon stepped in, but who the fuck wants some knock off Nike ""Air Forse Wuns"" from China?¬†

236,1664402420,xqpruv,1,"Hello,

I‚Äôm a stupid ape with a lot of capital. See post history. 

After losing money for an entire year I think I would like to double down and open a business right before we head into a recession. I have about a million in capital and I see an opportunity to blend Wall Street bets and to drink after your 0DTE put option expires worthless. 

I google searched ‚ÄúWall Street bars‚Äù in the U.S. and I only found one. It‚Äôs located in Ohio and has pretty basic amenities. (Drinks named after tickers, happy hour crashes on random drinks etc) 

My question is, are there people in this sub that would go to a bar that‚Äôs themed to Wall Street Bets? 

I was thinking about creating a leaderboard showing the highest rate of return of profit for their portfolios while creating a monthly drawing to see who has the best rate of return, top 3 would get Amazon gift cards. 

Also my biggest worry is true legal ramifications. This seems like a grey area business if I were to be committed and the last thing I want is to see Gary Gensler showing up with the FED to shut me down.

My 3 favorite long-term metrics on the app are:

1. Growth Rating- How likely a company is to grow in revenue and/or size in the next 1-2 years
2. Profitability Rating- How likely a company is to be profitable in the next few years
3. Upside Breakout - Higher scores indicate a larger chance of a sharp move upwards in price, any time within the next 1-2 years

&amp;#x200B;

My 3 favorite short-term metrics on the app are:

1. Net Institutional Flow- Tracks if institutions are buying up or selling off a stock, or options
2. Net Options Sentiment- Provides information on how long or short the market is on short duration options
3. Net Social Sentiment- Gauges positive &amp; negative sentiment from social media, as well as the difference between them

Three things:

1. **They have yet to revisit their bear market lows** (they‚Äôre stronger than most of the market).
2. **They put in the first inkling of bullish market structure** (they experienced significant bounces and are trying for a higher low)
3. **Their social activity is growing substantially** (people are showing interest in these stocks. They‚Äôre talking about them across social and news &amp; posts about them are trending)

Let's look at these 3 things in chart format:

**Tesla $TSLA:**

[$TSLA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/qa3ufmmv8op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365e7f85b98c892e7b3f7006c7a4454d45f50977)

**Amazon $AMZN:**

As you can see, these stocks have noticeably increased social activity that appears to be trending up in the last 2-3 months.

Now, what about stocks that have already revisited their bear market lows? Let‚Äôs take a look at a couple of popular stock picks that have performed poorly price-wise and spot the differences:

**NVIDIA $NVDA:**

[$NVDA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/l8dhcjzg9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e30185a23cb56a6e87bb09bd5d9675f45c6d52)

**Adobe $ADBE:**

While $NVDA and $ADBE experienced recent spikes in social activity, they do not show the same kind of sustained growth in activity (continuous interest from people) as many of the better-performing stocks. 

Therefore, in times like these when the macro environment and markets are bearish, it‚Äôs probably best to keep your eye on stocks with sustainable increases in social activity, rather than the stocks with little growth or growth that fades quickly. 

So, will $TSLA, $AMZN, and $AAPL hold above their bear market lows? Or follow the rest of the market? 

While the social data presented in these charts don't provide the answers, they do provide a different perspective that's interesting to think about.  

How do you interpret this information? Do you find it interesting and useful?","$TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN have yet to revisit their bear market lows, while the S&amp;P 500 and QQQ already have. Will these stocks follow the rest of the market?",1.0,2022-09-23 21:10:17
243,1663786458,xkdifc,1,"VC, real estate (a bit more complex), high debt companies, and smaller companies will be drowned out the next few years as they struggled to compete with 10-15% APR loans.

On the other hand, large tech giants with little or no debt will thrive as they will be competing in a landscape with anemic startup competition. Think Microsoft and Amazon no longer competing with smaller Cloud platforms as Cloud is capital intensive at the start.

Real estate is complex because real estate relies on cost-of-carry, and despite common consensus, most rentals are owned by individuals or small groups (families, a few partners teaming up). If the cost-of-carry goes up and stays high for a few years, then we expect these individuals will be less likely to hold onto their older properties when purchasing a new one. Thus, supply will increase and prices should drop.

Earnings for large companies may contract, or earnings growth may slow, but this does not matter so long as rates are eventually reduced back to what the Fed believes is neutral. In this case, that is around 2.5%.","The Fed expects an average short-term terminal rate of 4.6%, and a long-term terminal rate of around 2.5%.

Impressive Growth Story:

On par with Twitter in million monthly active users last reported @ 69 million and that company is presently valued at around $44bn, in comparison Rumble is currently deeply discounted at a value of only $2bn-$3bn.

## Growth Story:

(**Excerpt from CEO on SEC filing**) Before this explosion of growth, we were doing roughly 1, 1.5 million monthly active users. In our first major leg of growth, we posted 21 million monthly active users in Q4 of 2020. By the summer, of Q3 of 2021, Rumble hit another leg of growth, hitting an average of 36 million monthly active users on the platform.

Rumble saw another massive leg of growth happen, averaging an average of 44 million monthly active users in Q2 of 2022. Then that takes us to now, and what we‚Äôve seen now is probably one of the most exciting times that I‚Äôve ever seen in running this business. We are now transcending politics. This has nothing to do with politics anymore. We hit 78 million monthly active users globally in August of 2022, with 63 million alone in just US and Canada.

# What makes them different:

Censorship has become a major problem on the YouTube platform for content providers and they are starting to take notice. I believe it‚Äôs about to reach a tipping point on its way to juggernaut status. Mainstream media and tech companies continue to ignore alternate viewpoints or actively try to suppress information.

Information suppression is likely to get worse after the midterm elections go badly for the democrats, with platforms likely to double down on their idea censorship. Rumble is a bootstrapped company whose main tenet is to resist censorship which will eventually cause a shift in the most popular names to move platforms to regain their freedom.

## Notable Investors:

May 19, 2021 - Peter Thiel and venture capital firm, Narya Capital, which was co-founded by author J.D. Vance. Narya‚Äôs Ethan Fallang will be joining Rumble‚Äôs board of directors.

Peter Thiel isn‚Äôt in the habit of losing money!

David Sacks - another member of the famed Paypal mafia was recently complaining that an episode of his popular podcast had been removed from YouTube without explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

## Nimble and actively recruiting

After Truth Social went live in February with a rocky start users couldn‚Äôt sign up because of glitches Rumble stepped in and migrated the platform to its cloud infrastructure in April.

It's planning on offering its cloud web hosting service with guarantees to uphold freedom of speech and plans to make it available to all users in 2023.

# Conclusion

Take this lesson from the past as to why you should support free speech platforms even if you are not currently in need or personally affected:

*First, they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî Because I was not a Socialist.*

*Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äî Because I was not a Trade Unionist.*

*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî Because I was not a Jew.*

*Then they came for me‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.*

The company has raised over a Billion dollars in cash through a stock sale and also boasts a billion dollars in inventory. 

They retired all debt early and have leased a 700,000 square foot distribution warehouse with plans on leasing more warehouse space in the future.  

They have an entire section dedicated to PC gaming including peripherals and individual components, with prices comparable or even below that of amazon. 

They have shut down low performing stores while simultaneously cutting its c-suite bloat, using that money instead as a compensation package for its front line retail workers. 

They have a board of directors who actually *listen* to their shareholders, and a shareholder base who actively communicates their needs to the board. 

Their current negative EPS is a direct result of an increased investment in transforming the company; see RC‚Äôs Chewy interview for his philosophy on growing a business. 

They have not only created a marketplace for buying and selling digital assets, but have also created their own wallet and been partnering with pioneers in the space such as Loopring, IMX, and most recently FTX.

Their *beta* marketplace did more volume in its first 3 days than coinbase‚Äôs marketplace has done in its lifetime.

The e t h merge has just happened, reducing the energy cost of transactions by 99.8%.

Investors in GME have Directly Registered 23% of the entire company as of GME‚Äôs Q3 10-Q.

Public short interest currently stands at ~51 million shares or 25% of the float, still extraordinarily high.

***Friday September 16, 20 Fucking 22***. Last night, FedEx's CEO had some very choice words to say about the economy after his company cut a third off of their EPS estimate from $5.14 to $3.44. Keep in mind, this is the absolute worst delivery company on the market, with the highest lost package rate, AND longest average delivery times. But here‚Äôs what big boy Subramaniam had to say,

‚Äú MY COMPANY DOESN‚ÄôT SUCK THE ECONOMY IS JUST ABOUT TO HIT THE WORST EVER RECESSION DUDE! IF MY COMPANY ISN'T DOING GOOD IMAGINE HOW BAD APPLE‚ÄôS DOING!‚Äù 

That‚Äôs what he said and I quote. Fax. Anyway for whatever reason Wall Street seems to agree with  Subramaniam and the market (SPY and QQQ) opened lower and fell to -X on the day. For the first few hours finance and energy fell the hardest. OH I FORGOT BOIS MICH SENTIMENT CAME OUT THIS MORNING!

So, our consensus was 60 and we came in just short at 59.5 which is slightly bullish for stocks but our previous MCSI was 58.5. So technically sentiment is higher than last month but barely, and technically we were lower than consensus‚Ä¶It evens out but be aware we aren't dropping sentiment like we would hope. Back to the markets. 

While finance and energy so far are today‚Äôs biggest losers (Sal and Joe) sitting at an averaged -3.5%, retail and automakers are barely down an averaged -0.5%. Amazon however, on the ‚Äútech‚Äù side of retail was down 3.5% by 7:30 (10:30 for you east coasties). Other company‚Äôs I like that are down today trading  are: 

* $SQ (Block Inc.) ***-4.5%***
* $GE (General Electric) ***-3.5%***
* $SOFI (SoFi Technologies) ***-4.5%***
* $BA (Boeing) ***-4.5%***
* $SNAP (Snapchat) ***-5%***
* $COP (ConocoPhillips) ***-2%***
* $ADBE (Adobe) ***4.5%***

* The Federal Minimum Wage (currently $7.25/hr) is almost guaranteed to increase very soon. 
* Currently the longest streak without an increase in the Federal Minimum Wage (13 years -- last raise was in 2009. Previous longest streak was 10 years from 1997 to 2007)
* Many other States and Cities have already been increasing their Minimum Wage significantly. Federal rate will have to follow and catch up. 
* High inflation and cost-of-living will push the US Government to take action. 

**It's time for the US Government to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, and it most certainly will happen soon.** Currently in the longest streak without an increase (13 years dating back to 2009), the $7.25 per hour Minimum Wage will have to quickly catch up as many States have already taken action and raised their Minimum Wage over the past few years. Further forcing the issue is the high inflation and rising cost-of-living which adds huge pressure on the Government to take action. 

The U.S. hasn't raised the Federal Minimum Wage since 2009, the longest streak since the national Minimum Wage was enacted in 1938 under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).   


Most individual States have already increased their Minimum Wage (see table at the bottom). Cities have done the same, with Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, New York City, and others already at a $15+/hr minimum wage. 

A number of major corporations have already raised their Minimum Wage, including Amazon ($AMZN), Bank of America ($BAC), Costco ($COST), Chipotle ($CMG), Starbucks ($SBUX), Target ($TGT), Walmart ($WMT), and others. 

President Biden recently raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 (see: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/minimum-wage-for-federal-contractors-to-rise-to-15-an-hour-11637599697](https://www.wsj.com/articles/minimum-wage-for-federal-contractors-to-rise-to-15-an-hour-11637599697) )(see: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/28/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-15-minimum-wage-for-federal-workers-and-contractors-going-into-effect/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/28/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-15-minimum-wage-for-federal-workers-and-contractors-going-into-effect/) ), so the movement is already underway. However, there is still a battle in Congress whether the $15 Federal Minimum Wage will become official. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúOf course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages‚Ä¶and to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.‚Äù  

	‚ÄìPresident Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015

&amp;#x200B;

Things to consider:

1) Does increase in Minimum Wage lead to higher inflation? Even if it does, don't these workers deserve to get paid more?

2) $15 per hour might be worth a lot more to someone living in a city or state with a lower cost-of-living. People living in major cities with high expenses might need more. 

3) Could higher minimum wage have negative effects on some businesses? Perhaps.

&amp;#x200B;

**Whether the Minimum Wage will increase to $15 or a lower number is still up for debate. However, an increase, even a smaller one, is certainly needed.**

One section that covers most of the bases.

&gt;It appeared that Cohen, the billionaire founder of Chewy, the ‚ÄúAmazon for pets,‚Äù was using the same playbook he‚Äôd applied to the video-game retailer GameStop. In early 2021, Cohen led an activist campaign to resurrect the company‚Äôs left-for-dead stock, inspiring retail investors on Reddit to send its share price soaring and, in the process, blowing up a hedge fund or two that had shorted GameStop. With Cohen‚Äôs investment, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had officially become a meme stock.

&gt;After an initial pop on the news of Cohen‚Äôs involvement, its share price sank back down, dipping below $5 in July. But in August, when Cohen had to redisclose his position in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond owing to a change in the company‚Äôs total amount of shares, the apes on Reddit interpreted it to mean Cohen had gone bullish again on the company ‚Äî despite the fact that he hadn‚Äôt traded any shares in months. The filings once again showed that Cohen owned far-out-of-the-money call options on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, essentially wagering that the stock would soar above $80. It was old news, but Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock jumped 70 percent following the disclosures.

&gt;Retail investors had played right into Cohen‚Äôs hands. By the end of the following day, he had sold all of his stock, according to a subsequent filing. The revelation sent the company‚Äôs stock crashing, while Cohen walked away with a $68 million profit.

&gt;Now, some investors are wondering if Cohen had planned this from the beginning ‚Äî exploiting his reign as meme king to execute what critics are calling a pump-and-dump scheme. The out-of-the-money options struck investors as particularly suspicious. ‚ÄúWhy are you buying $80 calls with the stock under $20 if you‚Äôre not looking to manipulate the stock?‚Äù says Marc Cohodes, a famed short-seller.

&gt;It‚Äôs hard to allege Cohen committed a securities violation on the basis of simply making accurate regulatory disclosures and legally selling stock on the open market ‚Äî which has made many on Wall Street all the more upset. ‚ÄúThe way he did it reeks of a pump and dump, just reeks of it,‚Äù says Whitney Tilson, the CEO of Empire Financial Research, who filed a complaint with the SEC alleging Cohen engaged in securities manipulation through a pump-and-dump scheme. ‚ÄúThis has been going on for forever ‚Äî Ryan Cohen just came up with a clever, innovative, nefarious twist.‚Äù

&gt;In the days following Cohen‚Äôs sale, however, the true extent of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond‚Äôs woes became clear. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs highly problematic for Ryan Cohen to place individuals on the board, dump all of his shares, and then the next day we learn that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has hired restructuring experts and now they‚Äôre engaged in some financial difficulties,‚Äù says Daniel Taylor, a Wharton professor who specializes in fraud.","New York Magazine - Beware Ryan Cohen, the Meme-Stock King",1.0,2022-09-12 22:05:00

Under the agreement, Apple will pay 95% of the costs Globalstar incurs launching new satellites to build out the network. Globalstar said it will raise capital to cover the cost of building and launching the satellites; Goldman Sachs is working with the company to secure financing.

*The most important reason for why Apple chose Globalstar is to stay one step ahead of the competition. The fact that Amazon was so interested in a potential partnership with Globalstar definitely raised the eyebrows of Tim Cook and the crew.

The violent drops have subsided since May 2022 when $WISH hit 52 week low of 1.20 and has been bouncing from 1.20 - 2.00 since. If we break below that 1.20 support, there could be some serious trouble, but it seems like a reasonable high risk / high reward play at these levels. There have been a lot of ecommerce and shit stocks with comparable earnings and revenue that have dropped substantially after IPO, only to skyrocket a couple years later, like $SNAP for example.

The new CEO is out after only 7 months, Interim CEO is with GGV Capital ''Joe served as a Director at Alibaba Group to head the operations and product management at AliExpress, as well as international corporate development at Alibaba Group. Joe was also a founding leadership team member of Amazon Global Selling and Amazon Marketplace businesses in China.''

Whispers of buyouts in the underbelly of the internets. Short interest has gone down and there are some momentum indicators that look favorable. While we may not ''squeeze,'' this price would boost substantially with large inflows since it has such a low market cap.

&amp;#x200B;

Even when we zoom in (below 1 yr) we see that the market absolutely loved the reveal of its ""Lab-to-Market"" platform but still is pricing it for bankruptcy because of the low cash on hand combined with cash burn.

https://preview.redd.it/fjnnsg8q8wm91.jpg?width=3319&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61c0951d7593d19495bc249db0234ebbc2ba6f1e

**Why Bankruptcy is off the table:** Since 2016 Amyris has been working on its vertically integrated lab-to-market platform and started pushing out brands based on molecules that it has scaled up. I'm sure either you, your wife, or her boyfriend may have heard of these brands.

https://preview.redd.it/rudk09wq8wm91.jpg?width=1336&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=505c684bbd1d674a8c3a66e7cc825edd99995da8

All of these brands are based off of molecules developed from Amyris' lab to market platform. Squalane, Hemi-Squalane, CBG, RebM, Ectoine, Bio Silica, derivatives of Farnesene etc. By the end of the year, Amyris will be the FIRST company to scale up 20 molecules more than all of its competitors combined.

Every molecule developed by Amyris is more sustainable than other methods. See RebM example below.

Amyris has been targeting beauty and cosmetics because this sector can have really fast market acceptance. Because of the ""Lipstick effect"", these brands will also do well during recessions. Not all brands will be a success, but that's ok!

Amyris also has names like John Doerr backing it, I'm pretty sure the guy behind Amazon and Google isnt going to let his synbio stock die off.

**Now... none of this means that Amyris is safe. But it does mean there is an opportunity at hand. Here are the two events that we will be watching for.**

**1) What will Amyris' price be if it proves that it wont go bankrupt?**

**2) What will Amyris' price be if it proves that it is the first viable synbio company after (1)?**

**I don't know the answers to these questions... but I'm pretty sure its more than $3.70**

I think this is the last cup of tea before the 10 year tendie train takes off. There is also a big gap that can be filled.

## The problem: 41% of humanity is offline

Over a decade ago, internet access got established as a fundamental human right. However, 3.2 billion people remain offline. \[[1](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280222-The-Mobile-Economy-2022.pdf),[2](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-digital-divide-internet-data-broadband-mobbile/)\] Cellular dead zones plague the world, and 6% of global population doesn't even have cellular coverage.

Imagine how your life would be different without internet: no email, no Google, no YouTube, no Wikipedia, no social media, no chat apps. That's the reality for billions. And 6% of people \[[1](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/280222-The-Mobile-Economy-2022.pdf)\] have it even worse - not just no internet access, but also no cellular coverage. Even calls with family or to emergency services can't be taken for granted by everyone, or everywhere.

Based on the current rate of the internet coverage expansion projected by the United Nations, the goal of getting 90% of the world‚Äôs population online won‚Äôt be achieved before 2050. \[[16](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/universal-internet-access-unlikely-until-2050-experts-say-lack-skills-investment-slow-growth)\]

Without aggressive innovation, meeting this target will take even longer. High initial costs of cell towers dramatically slow down connectivity expansion in the developing world. In the poorest nations, an internet connection is unaffordable for most. This won‚Äôt change as long as the necessary infrastructure remains expensive.

Countless people have died because they had no cellular connectivity to call for help.  
Lack of connection with the outside world dramatically adds to the monetary misfortune of the world‚Äôs poorest, closing doors to potential opportunities for lifting themselves out of poverty.

This is also bad for human civilization as a whole. Many geniuses came from impoverished backgrounds. There are currently hundreds of millions of children, many of them undoubtedly gifted - potential next Einsteins and Newtons and Elon Musks - with no internet access. Just imagine all their contributions if they were able to join the global academic and business community. There are historical cases of people with no formal training making substantial contributions to science, such as the fascinating story of Srinivasa Ramanujan \[[17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)\].

## The solution: turn all phones into satellite phones

Cellular coverage and internet access go hand in hand. 92.8% of internet users use mobile devices to go online most of the time. There are 5.27 billion unique mobile users, increasing each year rapidly. \[[18](https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview)\]

Today, only about 25 percent of the world‚Äôs landmass is served by cell towers, the rest has no coverage \[[19](https://lynk.world/our-technology)\]. Traditional terrestrial tower networks will never reach full global coverage, as there are no economic incentives to expand into low population density and low-income areas. For a solution, we must look to the sky.

Satellite constellations are magic made real. They provide robust wireless networks with global coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional terrestrial towers. The satellites can easily cover the whole planet, including the most impoverished regions. The services can then be priced accordingly in each region to be affordable by locals.

Many understand the gravity of the global connectivity problem and the economic opportunity that it presents. Recent technology advancements and the rapid decrease of payload to orbit costs started a commercial space race. Starlink from Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX and Project Kupier from Amazon are some of the most prominent players.

However, even the most advanced satellite constellations are of no benefit to those who can‚Äôt afford their services. Nearly all existing services require customers to purchase expensive hardware such as satellite phones (&gt;$1,000 for Iridium sat phone) or mounted terminals with powered antennas ($599 for a Starlink terminal \[[20](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991841/spacex-starlink-price-hike-inflation-user-terminal)\]).

For this reason, a space-based cellular broadband network which works with regular phones that people already own is the holy grail.

## The opportunity: it‚Äôs still early for AST SpaceMobile stock

Until recently, the technology of direct satellite to unmodified mobile phone communication has been the stuff of imagination. AST SpaceMobile (ticker: ASTS) is now making it a reality.

AST SpaceMobile has the first-mover advantage, nearly $500M funding, unique product, over 2400 patent claims \[[5](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780312/000095017022010109/asts-ex99_1.htm)\] and exclusive commercial agreements with Vodafone/Rakuten/AT&amp;T \[[21](https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2022/04/10/ast-spacemobile-cso-details-companys-challenge-to-the-satellite-to-cell-paradigm/)\] and other big players which allows it to target billions of customers almost instantly once their satellites get deployed.

It already proved their solution works by establishing space communication with their prototype satellite.

This in-depth report will analyze the AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS \[[22](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24asts)\]) stock as an investment.

We believe that if the company succeeds in its mission, it could bring shareholders eye-popping returns by 2030, e.g. as much as 50x\~ from a $10¬± entry price. This report explains how.

At Transhumanica Research, we focus precisely on opportunities like this: high pro-social returns for humanity and high potential financial rewards for visionary investors in our community.

We believe that ASTS has all the ingredients necessary to become a ‚Äúcult stock‚Äù.

284,1662565929,x88ncu,1,"Apple is widely expected to give a first look at its latest iPhone lineup on Wednesday, as the tech giant has done every year in September for about a decade.

The latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It‚Äôs rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model ‚Äì meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.

Finally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company‚Äôs flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.

It‚Äôs not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday‚Äôs event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.

Apple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple‚Äôs bigger breakout successes in recent years.

Apple‚Äôs event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: ‚ÄúFar out.‚Äù 

This has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.

While the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.

Many analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.

Apple‚Äôs stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.

But with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales ‚Äî and all the subscription revenue that comes with that ‚Äî be enough to turn Apple‚Äôs stock from red to green?

Investors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. 

Analysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world‚Äôs most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.

The company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.

One analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That's because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.
Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple's initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with ""macro storm clouds building."" So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.
""This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years,"" Ives added.
Apple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.
According to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).
Apple is that rare beast, a stock that still is exciting enough for the growth crowd but is also attractive to value investors thanks to its reasonable price, penchant for stock buybacks to boost earnings and a steadily growing dividend.",CNN reports - Apple is set to unveil iPhone 14 at ‚Äòfar out‚Äô event | Will they also reveal their satellite partnership with Globalstar (NYSEAMERICAN: GSAT),1.0,2022-09-07 15:52:09

Hi, so I work in a picture frame shop and I handle ordering for all materials.

We understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram‚Äôs parent, Friday ‚Äî ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company‚Äôs lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland‚Äôs Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities ‚Äî however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.

Ireland‚Äôs DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: ‚ÄúWe adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of ‚Ç¨405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.‚Äù

The Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) ‚Äî following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR‚Äôs transparency principle.

The Instagram complaint focused on the platform‚Äôs processing of children‚Äôs data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to ‚Äúpublic‚Äù by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to ‚Äúprivate‚Äù.

The GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally ‚Äî as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children‚Äôs information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).

The reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn‚Äôt leak early).

While today‚Äôs headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it‚Äôs under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children‚Äôs data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it‚Äôs likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.

The Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland‚Äôs draft decision ‚Äî triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.

Ireland‚Äôs WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft ‚Äî and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.

If you think that monopolies are relics of the past, [this report](https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers) released by Open Markets Institute is a must-read. Here are some stunning excerpts:

* Since 1993, consolidation has reduced the number of large defense firms from 107 to five.
* Amazon sells¬†74 percent¬†of all e-books sold online, and it sells¬†64 percent¬†of all print books sold online.
* CVS and Walgreens control 89% of the drug store business.
* Google controls¬†[64 percent](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings/comScore-Releases-February-2016-US-Desktop-Search-Engine-Rankings)¬†of all desktop searches and¬†[94 percent](https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&amp;qpsp=2016&amp;qpnp=1&amp;qptimeframe=Y&amp;qpcustomd=1)¬†of all global and mobile tablet searches.
* Two companies, Mars and Hershey, control 75% of the candy market in America.

Big Tech companies are the most well-known offenders with a few companies controlling almost everything we do online.

While it‚Äôs Big Tech that captures all the headlines, almost all the industries are now dominated by a few companies. Look around your store the next time you go grocery shopping - you might think that as a consumer you have a plethora of choices. But in reality,

https://preview.redd.it/92tsiukag1m91.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aac3a72e7f926223c47fd47cb1c4826efd2109ab

There are arguments [for and against](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/economics-101-what-is-a-monopoly) a few companies controlling the majority of market share that are beyond the scope of this article. *The question which I‚Äôm interested in as an investor is* whether these companies tend to outperform the market and provide stable returns while doing so.

After all, Warren Buffett‚Äôs favorite types of business are the ones that have huge economic moats which are near-monopolies in the industries they operate in. Once, [asked at an annual meeting](https://www.barrons.com/articles/myth-of-capitalism-book-excerpt-51544500404) what his ideal business was, Buffett argued that it was one that had ‚Äúhigh pricing power, a monopoly.‚Äù The message is clear according to Buffett: If you‚Äôre investing in a business with competition, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.

### Monopoly Returns

Anyone who has played the Monopoly board game knows the unbridled joy of collecting rent for the properties you own and driving your competitors to bankruptcy. I wanted to see if the same process is reflected in real life where companies having a monopoly in certain sectors could drive out competitors, rise prices, and give an outsized return on investment.

If you try to do a backtest on the biggest monopolies of today, you would quickly run into hindsight bias. The companies that are monopolies now might or might not have been monopolies a decade back. For example, there was no way of knowing Google would dominate the in-app ecosystem in Phones, and that Amazon would be the king of cloud services back in 2010.

To overcome this, I went back in time *(using this* [*nifty little feature from Google*](https://mashable.com/article/google-search-by-date)*)* and searched for publications covering monopoly investments. I found two relevant articles that we can use for the analysis.

1. **The next 7 American Monopolies** \- [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-next-7-american-monopolies-2010-11?IR=T) (2010)
2. **The Forbes.com Monopoly Index** \- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/13/monopolyindex.html?sh=16b32f1e4a2d) (2001)

A total of 17 stocks were covered by the two publications. Our benchmark as always is the tried and trusted S&amp;P 500 as most of the companies covered in the research are large-cap stocks.

The results are incredible. Monopoly companies on average returned **double** that of the S&amp;P 500 benchmark during the same period. 65% of the companies in the list beat the benchmark and only in 2 cases would you have lost money on your investments (*yes, even adjusting for inflation).*

https://preview.redd.it/ao8m2c7fg1m91.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43451cf0978eaaa10288d1ec08438f899497d589

The results were so surprising that I checked academic research papers to see if what I was observing was in line with the norm *(as we are slightly away from the sample size required for significance)*. While there are no direct papers evaluating the performance of monopolies, established research shows that companies having large market share tend to outperform smaller competitors and the market.

[**Journal of Business &amp; Economics Research**](https://clutejournals.com/index.php/JBER/article/view/2756/2804) evaluated the performance of 85 companies (50 Large-Cap &amp; 35 Mid-Cap Firms) with wide economic moats.

&gt;*Relative to the market, the aggregate appreciation of large-caps surpassed more than 85 percent of all stocks and the mid-caps more than 78 percent. While there were individual laggards on both lists, they were relatively few in number. The author‚Äôs subset demonstrated the most pronounced gains. All three lists would have handily surpassed the S&amp;P benchmark during the benchmark period.*  
*Source:* [*Is sustainable competitive advantage an advantage for stock investors?*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151)

[**Applied Economics**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151) investigated the stock returns of companies with sustainable competitive advantage (the moat).

&gt;*Our results indicate that Wide Moat stocks have created significant value for their investors. An equal and value-weighted portfolio of these companies rebalanced annually has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 3000 indices over the period of our study (June 2002‚ÄìMay 2014).*

### Conclusion

I wish this would be as simple as investing in companies in industries having a high concentration. But, as always, all the simple &amp; direct strategies tend to be captured already in the market. [Recent studies](https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/monopolies-are-distorting-the-stock-market) indicate that

&gt;*Stocks in concentrated industries trade at higher multiples as the market is smart enough to recognize their monopoly power. Therefore, an investment strategy that simply buys companies in concentrated industries does not outperform.*

This does not mean all is lost - We just have to go one step deeper. The same studies show that you can outperform the market by:

a. **Investing in industries with rising concentration** as the market seems slow to recognize their increased prizing power

b. **Adding a layer of valuation metric** \- When monopoly companies run into difficulty, investors tend to underestimate their ability to rebound and undervalue their shares.

So the next time you‚Äôre considering a stock for long-term investment, add this layer to your analysis: Does the company have prospects of growing into a monopoly or dominant player in a market with just a few players, or is it a lucrative market where competitors can eat away the profits? The first is what you should bet on.",Investing in Monopolies,1.0,2022-09-05 13:04:09

**THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

BBBY is headed straight to bankruptcy, and there's nothing you and Sue can do about it. At this rate, BBBY holders are donating their money to the golden parachute showers for BBBY execs.

Let's look at the facts as to why bulls are about to drown in cheap liquor:

\- THERE WILL BE NO SQUEEZE. Your last hope is that RegSHO will force a squeeze. That in itself is regarded and not how it works. Regardless, BBBY is confirmed to not be in RegSHO

\- Shorts made like 600% in the past two weeks; they are not pressed to cover. The only thing they're covering is your wife's face.

**Here are the facts:**

\- BBBY has five months of runaway left thanks to an additional $375M FILO loan and an asset-backed $150M revolving debt raise. The company expects to spend in capital expenditures $250M a year, down from $400M, but not total expenses; that's much higher. It was spending about $100M a month in the past year. ALSO very important, a FILO loan is one of the most aggressive loan types, meaning BBBY is desperate. How desperate? Picture a man in the desert without water who starts to drink his urine.

\- At best, BBBY has bought itself another few months (this is a rough estimate, you nerd) with its latest moves. 150/1000 Store closing and layoffs are not moving the needle in a worsening market

\- When it comes to bankruptcy, stonk holders are like LifeCare patients at memorial hospital during hurricane Katrina (I've been watching Five Days at Memorial, IYKYK). It means you're fked.

\- In a time of liquidation, creditors, aka lenders, get priority. Once they receive all of their money back, the leftover is for equity holders. And before equity holders get their money back, you best believe executives will dip their toes.

**So what's BBBY's doing?**

Well, only the execs know, but this is my guess based on their actions. In summary, the company is in fundraising mode. They're trying to raise as much money as possible. They've exhausted their debt options, and they're coming for your piggy bank.

Let's understand their equity structure:

\- 900M shares authorized, meaning they can issue up to this many shares or have done so historically

\- Of that, 688.767M were issued (meaning all shares the company ever created to sell for fundraising)

\- Of that, 161.937M are outstanding, the number of shares not owned by the company, and 76M of those shares are floated, meaning shares you and your wife's boyfriend trade in the open market without restrictions

\- Enter the big swinging trojan horse dick who will tear your bank account a new hole, the ATM offering, which adds 12M to the 76M shares outstanding, a 15% increase in shares. This would drop the current price of $8.71 to $7.52, AT LEAST. Given how shit volume is, it's going a lot lower.

**So what's their plan really?**

BBBY is pursuing two efforts, a) fundraising money to pay their debt and suppliers in hopes they don't stop servicing them (some already have since they're not paying), and b) pursuing 'growth' opportunities. What type of growth opportunities? Imagine your Boomer I, hot grandma trying to optimize her website and take traffic from Amazon. Good luck; you're a decade too late.

**What will ultimately happen?**

We all know this is a simulation, so we know how this ends. Have you heard of Blockbuster? What about Toys-R-Us? Maybe Sears? What about RadioShack, the brand name Tai Lopez purchased in the discount bin?

BBBY, the ripper, awaits.

**Why am I being so aggressive on PUTS now?**

BBBY is showing its hand. It's desperate, it's trying to raise money, FAST, it's on life support. And guess what, it needs to service its creditors before it does its equity holders. Much like Dante, BBBY has descended into the gates of hell and awaits the nine circles ahead. BBBY is the drowning swimmer grasping for anybody to hold onto, even if it means drowning them. And guess what, regard, you're the clueless tourist who can't swim spinning in circles on your float and you're about to be 12 feet underwater. BBBY will sell you all the shares it can at current prices because it knows its marketcap is so overvalued it'd be stupid not to dump on you ASAP.

And don't get me started on volume. Do you notice pre and post-market there is no volume? Do you notice the only people buying are Reddit regards? And guess why the price isn't moving? Because BBBY is dumping shares on you. And guess what's going to happen next? You're all going to slowly walk to the exit, and when you realize everyone else is also leaving, you will run each other over.

314,1662007845,x2ylnr,1,"About 4 weeks ago I went into BBBY and spent $300 on an espresso machine. I could have bought it on Amazon, but I wanted to see it in person first. I wanted to feel it, see if it was built well, see how it would look at my home, all the things I can't do when I order the same product on Amazon. This is the aspect BBBY needs to completely focus on in order to survive. They will never be a huge volume retailer again. Those days are dead and gone. But, they can find a niche service that will keep their business operating and generating revenue.

You want to buy an espresso machine? Great. Here's 5 different options all set up to demo and here's a person on staff trained in their use to show you and answer your questions. You've been looking at that new blender? Great. Come on in and try it out. Make a smoothie. Someone will be there to clean the machines and make sure they are operating perfectly for you to try. Been looking at that new stainless steel pan set? Awesome, come give them a demo. We have a trained staff member and some portable burners so you can give it a try. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. People will just demo the product, find the one they like, and then go buy it on Amazon. BBBY just offered a free service and got nothing out of it. What a dumb idea. Well, I don't actually think that's what will happen. That's exactly what I thought I was going to do, but 2 things happened. One, I was right there in the store, I wanted to take the item home, and I was ok with paying a little bit extra. Two, I actually felt a sense of loyalty to the store that had helped me find the right product. This is the real kicker that I couldn't have predicted before I experienced it. BBBY offered me a valuable service, and in return, I wanted to support them and buy the product locally. I could see their employees working, chatting with each other, relaxed and seemingly not hating life, and it made me think of a warehouse full of Amazon slaves that were suffering to give me my product for 5% less. I didn't want to support that system.

So, will BBBY ever compete with Amazon or Walmart? No, they won't, but I don't think they need to. I think they need to be something different. Something new. And I think people will respond to it. I think people are realizing that the cheap prices at Amazon actually come at a cost, and they don't want to support that system anymore. Am I going to completely stop using Amazon? Of course not.

315,1662002944,x2x2qt,1,"Amazon was the next evolution of retail, and traditional brick stores have been feeling the pain for many years now. 

Traditional retail is now acting on thier retaliation against the Amazon threat. Most retailers now offer the same 2-3 day shipping but they also offer the ability to come into a store to touch and see the products. People dont have to rely on bought reviews of products anymore. Traditional retail has the brick infrastructure that Amazon doesn't have, matter of fact Amazon has to rent space in retail outlets and negotiate deals to allow people to drop off returns and pick up products.

Now between Covid and the recession ALL the traditional retail outlets have been able to accelerate thier plans. Stores are closing, people are being laid off and the model is changing. Costs are being cut, inventory is much tighter and goods can be delivered to locations as needed instead of moving massive amounts of stock around and waiting for it to sell. It is a lean and mean model. Plus the retailers get to make these cuts with all the blame falling on the pandemic and it's economic effects, they walk out of the situation without any of the bad publicity they would catch if these moves were made during a more stable time. We are going to see stores shift from a majority sales floor footprint to a majority stockroom footprint. Less shelves full of stacks of products to more example products and more diverse product offerings in a smaller space. No more asset protection personal or devices, no more stock personal keeping shelves full, less salesmen and the near complete elimination of cashiers. We are already seeing the elimination of cashiers all across the board for years now.

Around my city I am seeing massive distribution centers being built, the big developers are banking on these spaces being used. Honestly they probably already have the tenants lined up, although I cant verify that for sure yet. My personal experience as a commercial contractor for 30 years, and my gut tells me I am correct. The closed stores will be moved to the distribution centers, from which the majority of deliveries and installations will operate from. It takes much less personal to operate a distribution center than it does to operate a retail store. Less stores does NOT reflect any loss of sales volume. Only the distance you must travel to touch and feel the goods before buying. Amazon cannot provide that, nor can they provide the installations, and there are plenty of products that this train of thought applies to. Such as appliances, exercise equipment etc..

What we see now is the smartest companies have survived the Amazon assault, while many others have closed. Such as Kohl's, K-marts, JC Penny's, Sears and the list goes on. Those that are left are moving to skeleton crews, less stores, less overhead, better inventory management and much larger profits.

And now that I have suckered you into reading this far lets apply this new model to BBBY. 

1) The closing of 150 stores is GOOD, they are cutting the fat, dropping dead weight employees, curbing overhead, this is responsible forward looking decision making

2) The amount of financing that has been secured is WAY more than anticipated. This is also GOOD. No one would provide such funding if they didn't have a good plan moving forward.

3) BBBY did not have to sell the most profitable aspect of thier business to secure this funding, they retained Baby and all of its potential. New mom's wanna touch and feel the products that will be in thier nurseries, most drive small vehicles that are not capable of transporting products such as cribs and changing tables, toddler beds etc, and could probably benefit from installation as well. All aspects that brick stores can provide and Amazon cannot.

4) 12 million shares is nothing, that represents a SMALL percentage of the float. Its also a very arbitrary number, how did they decide on 12 mil? Why not 15, why not 10? Could the 12 be based on someone providing funding that needed 12mil liquidity? RC still has his appointees on the board, if the 12 mil didn't goto the financers maybe it found its way back to him? Maybe the 12 mil was a nod signal to WSB based on our membership? Maybe part of the revitalization plan depends on us doing ape shit? There is a lot of wheeling and dealing behind a lot of closed doors in these deals, and never forget the rich enjoy stealing from eachother just as much as stealing from the poor.

5) I found the terminology of the conference call interesting when she said "" the CFO has been eliminated"", not ""let go"", not ""replaced"", instead terminology that seems prejudicial, perhaps we are looking at a solid company except for some games the CFO was playing? Will we find out these games caused the current bankruptcy situation? Without a possibly corrupt CFO is this company actually better off than we think? The massive amount of new funding seems to indicate such. 

6) With the failure of Sears, Penny's, Kohls, etc who is the brick based mid grade product competition for BBBY? Walmart has the low grade market wrapped up, the high grade market was never the BBBY bread and butter anyway, so who is left, and if any are they as positioned to come out of this better than BBBY is now positioned? 

7) After today's announcement the stock held some good numbers, even me who was looking for that dip to $5 today and it never came. In my opinion for the news the stock held up like a champ. Really quite impressive resiliency to the bears, hell even JPow couldn't kick its ass like he did to the rest of the market. This is all GOOD!

In times like these I look at Warren Buffet, he made his bones buying early and cheap. No one will get rich investing in the same holdings buffet has now. He did, because he bought when those companies were cheap, early and had good setups. BBBY has good numbers for being in the midst of a recession and massive restructuring of the world, we all admit it should be around $30, and that was when bankruptcy seemed imminent, now with the new plan and funding $30 should be the minimum. This stock definitely has room to run 200% from the $10 its at now, and every share purchased makes the prospect more sound and the turn around that much quicker. If it should be at $30 now, whats it gonna be at when it turns around?

316,1662002859,x2x1uh,0,"Reg sho is bullshit.  Most of time FTDs are bullshit and meaningless.  Shorts don't have to cover. 

The 12 million share cap is being thrown about is completely false, complete fucking bullshit. The S3 is the governing document, and it determines when the maximum amount BBBY is authorized to sell. I suggest reading it. The answer is 900 million shares. 

BBBY can file a supplement at any time without any approval and sell as many shares as it wants to sell.   At this point, its a cut and past doc that takes 20 minutes to file. 12 million cap is completely false, complete fucking bullshit. Don't trust me. Ask any securities lawyer.

Regarding staving off BK, BBBY now has $500 million more in debt and negative $100 million per month in negative cash flow. 100/500 = 5 months &lt; 1 year. So if you are bullish, it is based on bad math.

The plan to shrink sales and migrate back to brands that have lower margins is too late.  It will just make things worse, because the problem is simple.  Amazon took the sales.   Don't trust me. Shop for a comforter on both websites and report back.

  
FTDs, sho rarely results in a squeeze. 

Since BBBY can now  file a supplement to the S3  with zero authorization and sell stock in 12 million lot tranches, that makes it pretty fucking hard to pull off a squeeze. BBBY will keep selling stock until the debt trades up to 100 cents on the dollar. Right now its 20 cent.

Two kinds of investors are in this boat for the bulls i recognized on todays WSB premarket call. 

No.1 the short squeeze player: these guys looking for a short squeeze an event where the share price jumps by short seller closing their short positions. They are in for the squeeze play and give basically no fucks about the company.

No.2 the BBBY believer store abuser : heard someone saying he would only buy stuff for his baby from BBBY becuase walmart/ amazon products are to dangerous for the baby apparently(no offense intended in case you read this). These guys would love a squeeze of course but even if they would know for 100% that this shit wont squeeze they would keep their shares because they genuinely think BBBY is a great company and needed in their lives. 

Many people here talking about ‚Äúonce the shorts cover‚Ä¶., this moons‚Äù ‚Äúmoon soon‚Äù
‚ÄúShorts have to cover/close‚Äù ‚Äúmoass imminent‚Äù

Im sorry but i have to correct you! Its most importantly that you understand that SHORTS DO NOT HAVE TO CLOSE.
Yes you read it right. They are able to hold on to their short positions or are able to create new ones. 
Here are some reasons in what scenarios shorts could eventually have a reason to close their short positions:

No.1 : CTB ( cost to borrow ) is getting insanly high. Having a short position will cost a certain fee since they borrow shares-&gt;sell them into the market and plan to buy them back at a later point so they owe the lender a certain amount of money.

The problem here is shorts are in because they think BBBY will go bankrupt so they plan to never buy back those borrowed shares. SHF( short hedgefunds ) usually have a huge amount of collateral to keep their short positions open those fees mostlikely are not that important to them specially if the float has not that many shares in total.

No.2 : the short thesis is getting destroyed. If the company in this case BBBY manages to make money instead of losing money monthly/quarterly/yearly then there would be no reason to short it since they wont go out if business. 

The company BBBY tho is cashflow negative they losing money. And they do not have a solid plan to change that. Thats why the short thesis looks valid. 


Everyone was waiting for the news for BBBY today and people expected a huge comeback. First of all they got a new loan which js basically good news since they can stay alive a bit longer but dont forget they also have to pay interest fees for their loan. The second thing was the closure of BBBY stores. This can never be positive! Never ! I know people here are writing posts why this is bullish and i dont know why they might be full regards ( most likely ) or they try to create some sort of fomo to dumb their bags on new investors shoulders. The new loan is giving BBBY a bit more time to stay in business but ask yourself how would they possible able to pay back their debts (share dilution will hapoen most likely) and how will they be able to turn into a profitable company. They part of being cashflow positive is more important than having no debts. How can they achieve that before defaulting ask yourself.

318,1661985988,x2r210,1,"BBBY has declining revenue and a relatively fixed cost structure yet it has a new plan to reduce the number of stores and cut labor so that it can solve its debt problem.  Since when does shrinking your business while migrating towards lower margin national brands solve a debt problem?  It will never fucking work.  

Everybody says the valuation of BBBY is $900 million.  Complete BS.   This conveniently ignores $5 billion of debt plus $500 million in additional debt (despie the friendlier ""financing"" term,) that is tacked on putting the same money losing business further in the hole..  If BBBY was debt free it would might have a $900 million valuation.   I doubt it though.  The company has no business.  Businesses are supposed to make money.  A company that is bleeding money at a clip of $100 million a month is not a business.   BBBY has 6 months to solve its problems.   Does anyone really think it will turn a profit in 6 months?  

Everybody mentions price to sales in the valuation metric for BBBY.  Its fucking stupid.   Companies that valued on sales have very high margin businesses (ie software business like Salesforce) that are growing and or that have a platform that is scaleable (ie Amazon) so that it is clear their cash flow improves in the future.  BBBY has a negative margin business with sales that are shrinking, and it simply can never compete with Amazon.  

BBBY does not have a dominant web presence, it does not have state of the art automated warehouses in every city, and it does not have drivers that already travel to your neighborhood every day spreading their cost of delivery over many more items.   Amazon can offer its private label products at a far lower cost, and these products are eating away at the business of national brands in textiles and at Bed Bath and Beyond.  The trend is your friend.  BBBY will never be able to compete in e commerce with Amazon, and the shift back towards national brands will not work.  It is too late.  The BBBY retail cost structure is a noose around its neck.  

I keep hearing about how GME squeezed and BBBY can do the same.  Not a comparable situation.  First, the squeeze happened when the entire stock market was valuing companies with no earnings based on a negative real cost of capital.  More importantly it was a Bull market where the Fed was buying every asset in sight.   Now the situation has reversed, the Fed is selling every asset, and we are in a Bear market and money losing companies have been hammered.  Sure Gamestop has raised a ton of cash at equity prices that were 50x higher than its low.   Still, it burned over $200 million in the last quarter, and its cash will last until the end of next year at best.  There will be a day of reckoning for all of these stocks unless redditors keep feeding the pigs.  Ryan Cohen will not save it.  You can bet your ass the day will come when he will post his 13D with some high priced calls and liquidate his stock in short order.  

The reddit ""team"" strategy of we are are going to squeeze others only works if no one sells.  AS someone said, investing is a dog eat dog world.  No one gives a shit about you.  Espcially here.   
Bulls and snake oils salesmen are the only ones with a voice due to downvoting.  

Everyone says they don't sell but last time I checked 160 million shares have sold in the last 2 days.  Someone is selling, and the price has fallen as a result.  Its a simple supply and demand situation.    More sellers and the stock goes down.    How often does someone say I sold in this sub?  Not to often, because if you do you can't do that here.  Karma silences reason.  

To pull off a short squeeze, this stock needs a positive catalyst.  Ie an activist investor, or a plan that actually works where they can make money in the future.  Sorry but borrowing another $500 million just means the enterprise value of this company is over $6 billion.  That debt is there. Its not going away.  And the market says its not getting repaid, or you wouldn't be able to buy it for 20% of the amount borrowed by BBBY.   When a companies sales are not profitable, it does not have a business.   BBBY does not have a business.  Its only chance of survival is convince you all to feed its money every quarter.   There is no way in hell that this group will do that forever..   

It may seem like you are among friends on your side, but only some of the people here are your friends.  Most sell you out every single day.  Sorry, it is the fucking truth. Don't be a dumbsass.

If you disagree, what is the end game here?  To continue to convince the masses that ponzi schemes in in stocks going out of business always work?  Businesses that lose a shit tons of cash eventually die.   Maybe not this week, but at some time.  Shorting and ponzi shemes have been around for 100 or more years.   Polaroid, Blockbuster, Toys R US, Borders books, Tower Records, GM, Kodak.  They all BK'd.   No amount of trickery could save them.  

If it does squeeze, do you really fucking think someone will give you a signal of when to cash out?  Fuck no.  They will cash out and then post bought more.  No one will ever say oh shit has turned, time to get out.   

Get a fucking life.   Bet on a real company.

For me the play for me was never a short squeeze, or merger bullshit. Icing on the cake yes, but not the real deal.

The play was a valuable company and subsidiaries being on a fire sale with a potential for a 180 business turn around and we got that. 

The volatility right now is hedges shaking the tree and watching the paperhands fall out.

This company has a solid plan, solid financing, and solid cost savings in line. Stores are now getting packed with people (because buying on Amazon for most shit sucks), and if their turn around works out, which i believe it will. We will see a great holiday revenue beat.

Ask yourself this, why is a company that has 1.13billion in financing, cutting 20% of office workforce (trimming fat), ramping up BuyBuyBaby, creating a new rewards platform, closing 150  low producing stores, reduced capital spending from $400 million to $250 million (50%). worth less than $900million?

$5.1 billion in assets, $4.9 billion in liabilities.

Don't give a shit about 12million share dilution. This stock trades 120million shares round every day. Dilution on that kind of volume doesn't mean anything.

They have 12months to sell anything after an S-3 report They will wait until they kick ass and beat earnings during the holiday season.  


When I heard the report, I just new it would work out still... just not the day trade kind of working out. Have you ever seen a company release this kind of info and crash normally.

Hey, guess what, [so did BBBY during Tritton's presidency](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-advances-1-billion-three-year-share) just last year! $1B dollar worth of stock buyback. Terrible idea. Stock has been spiraling downward ever since.

Even though Best Buy survived the 2008 crash, it faces yet another challenge: Amazon. What they did to turn things around is to focus on their [""showrooming"" and price-match challenge](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/amazon-almost-killed-best-buy-then-best-buy-did-something-completely-brilliant.html), and build partnership with product brands such as Apple. ""Showrooming"" is what big box retailers have an advantage over online retailers like Amazon. Bed Bath and Beyond better be showrooming lots of towels and scented candles.

# Sears

An infamous blunder down the capitalism drain. There isn't just one mistake to pinpoint when it comes to Sears, just a series of bad decisions one after another. Some notable errors: buying K-Mart when it was already struggling, failed to capitalize on the ""discounted goods"" market unlike Walmart, and failure to innovate. Very small e-commerce presence. Amazon took their customers like candies from a baby. Stores were not being maintained, and friction between upper management and employees are just icings on their bankruptcy cake.

To their credit, they did put some efforts, and did some right things, but more wrongs than rights.

&amp;#x200B;

# Six Flags

These guys managed to get out of the grip of bankruptcy because some hedgies and investment companies spent a whopping $725 million in debt restructuring and capital infusion, effectively reducing their debt from $2.7B to $1B. A whole lot of breathing room to invest that much capital on growth. This is somewhat similar to BBBY that JP Morgan decided to recapitalize with that $400M juice.

# Starbucks

Out of the 2008 economic meltdown, this one shines out and bright. You can order your pumpkin spice latte pretty soon, you millennial apes. What they did right was they closed down stores as they expanded too rapidly, shifted their focus back to customers, building relationship and brand awareness through social media and customer engagement.

1. BBBY will receive capital infusion from JP Morgan and RC Ventures (to be revealed tomorrow), just like Six Flags did. **This is good news.**
2. [There is a desire and need of restructuring and changes from the management](https://www.hometextilestoday.com/retailers/bed-bath-beyond-interim-ceo-we-are-working-with-urgency/). **This is also good news.** At least, they aren't sitting on their asses like Sears did.
3. Store closures. **This can be both good and bad.**
4. Bankruptcy is more likely out of the table. What Sue with reveal tomorrow will determine all your bets. Although at this point, I am just thinking the only way this company can go even lower is bankruptcy news. Since it's unlikely, it's just up from here on.

To BUSINESS!

Forget Fun-dementials, SHF, forget Cohen, forget all that fluff. Since the dawn of time, early bird got the worm. Is the bird smarter? Is it stronger? Is it just lucky? Dunno. Don't give a shit. When you surf a wave, you don't ponder where in the ocean it got started. You catch it EARLY, and you HOLD THE FUCK ON.

I've been seeing some people struggle with the play here, and the whole ""rEaSoN"" why we're here.

Okay. From the top.

SCENARIO 1:
Fellas. Let us begin by assuming we are all pretty much dead wrong. In that case, the big shorts know how to trick us, the SI is dead wrong at &gt;100%, And we're essentially doing a soft but very public pump n' dump.

MEANING:
JUST PLAY THE FUCKING PYRAMID. This isn't a team sport, fuck you and don't fuck your wife cuz she got AIDS from me. Sure. It's slimy AF. But what the fuck isn't in Wall Street? Eat your crayon and fuck your watermelon.


SCENARIO 2: 
Okay, let's assume we're  NOT wrong, but obviously this lovely ape poop echochamber/toilet is making us hear our own ape noise as whispers of the deep state. A'ight. Let me present to you two exhibits to google. ""GameStop short squeeze"" and ""Self-induced consensus of Reddit users to characterise the GameStop short squeeze"".
The exhibits TLDR is, more than any other manipulation or attempt to influence us, the biggest factor here is NATURAL MOMENTUM. Essentially, Jimmy isn't wrong and incompetent (I DONT BELIEVE THAT BUT ROLL WITH IT) and probably not paid by hedgies, at the very very very least not directly. Nor does he have a major stake in this. NOBODY does. Not Yahoo, CNBC... ANYONE. Only sad HF managers and some rich but not exotically rich asscunts.
(remember guys. SCENARIO. Not my opinion nor my inverse opinion.)

APE BRAIN HURT, EXPLAIN IN NOISES!:
We're literally inviting anyone who agrees with us how dumb the shorts are to play this to our side. Not because they ""like"" us, but because that's the only play.
What would you do if you ran BlackRock? Attempt a strategy with infinite risk or claim that risk to your pocket?
EXACTLY. (refer to ""Gains by existing shareholders and third parties"" under ""Impact on involved entities"" on exhibit A).

Also, see my note below if you're interested in the future of Wall Street as a whole, and why I think we're literally the grave diggers for shorts for the rest of history (or until H. sapiens forget. They do that alot.)

SCENARIO 3:
Basically, not only is every positive verification of our retarded notions from S2 are correct, but so are ALOT of our theories.

I'm saying, for example
-Major mass-media players really are held by extremely wealthy and risk-loving 1%ters.
-Jimmy really does sell instructions for dummies, rather than being an ""ExPeRIEnceD TraddeRRR""
-Rich people know other rich people, and are more likely to be connected in a social sense. (That's just a pure fact. Why do you think nepotism is a thing? Why do you think the gov bails out banks when it doesn't have to? and so on). Meaning, even if ""legally speaking"" they're golden, the TL;DR is you're less significant for their daily life than a fly that flew into their room. a fly they never noticed. THAT'S how insignificant you are to them.

OOH OOH AHH AHH!: 
Yes my friend, in-deed.

SCENARIO 4:
Basically, scenario 3++. RC/Someone is playing 5D chess, and a major sort of merger/acquisition/whateverthefuck is incoming. Gogl ""Kroger BBBY"". Is it true? I HAVE NO CLUE.

MEANING??!!!!:
That we're going to 1000$. I kid you not. Sure, I pulled that number out of my ass, but that's where I get the feces I throw at non-apes. Seems like a good place to look.
An acquisition means THERE'S A LONG PLAY.
***I AM NOT SAYING 1K WILL STAY THE PRICE. I MEAN THAT'S THE PEAK OF THE SQ I THINK IS POSSIBLE***

So, I think that is enough to text to assert my dominance over you. All of these scenarios are ALREADY highly likely.
BUT WAIT, you ask,


*HOW THE FUCK IS THERE A LONG PLAY, YOU FUCKING CROOK*

Look, retards. All the FUD about retail shops dying breaks down into 4

1. Amazon (and co.)
2. COVID
3. America, and along with it, THE WORLD, playing it fast and loose since the Information revolution began.
4. Worker shortages (refer to 3)

They are all complete bullshit. I'll explain

Worker shortages are pretty easy to explain. With the rise of automation and the ""common man"" being more informed than ever before, we just have people understanding entry lvl jobs are pretty much lite slavery with extra steps. Social security and working condition laws are a JOKE in the US. I'm sorry.

Fast and loose with credit - Refer to the 2008 Subprime mortgage crisis, the 1987 crash, the motherfukin great recession, and of course - The fall of the CCP by the hands of the Chinese mortgage uprising/two-way-rape. (Look up ""Github china mortgage"". It's scary and hilarious and wonderful.)

COVID. The mother of all poor excuses. I'm not even touching that.

FINALLY!
AMZN is going down. Why? take your damn pick. Workers' rights' movements are on the rise. A lot of sections are flooded with cheap, Winnie-Pooh made GARBAGE. Stock prices at an all time high. Bozos is playing with rocket fuel with his private capital. competitors are slowly catching up.
And besides all that shitstorm, you have two more critical things. ONE, retail will make a comeback, unless we're all uploaded to the cloud anytime soon. It won't kill amazon let alone ecommerce, but it will recover and thrive moderately, like it used to in 2010-2015. 
TWO. We're headed into a bloody recession. Cheap cloud storage? undercutting ecommerce? bloody CLOUD CHIPS (sup, Annapurna)????
Whatt does any of that matter if NOBODY HAS ANY FUCKING MONEY. E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E IS GOING TO LOSE. even US.
Prepare for fucking soup for the unemployed on the streets. WHO IS GONNA FUCKING BUY ANYTHING? WHAT FUND/INST WILL INVEST IN STARTUPS? NO. ONE.
copy and paste all that shit for BBY, WALMART, whatever. Only one I'm afraid of is COSTCO, and luckily they're not a threat.

This isn't advice.
This isn't an expert's thesis.
I am not an expert. I never finished grade school.
This isn't proper analysis. This is a wall of copypasta I literally got off of the CIA's alien document drawe, which ofc doesn't exist.

We still don't know.  What's been bothering me a little a bit is this thing called perspective...

So he dipped from BBBY for $60mil.  Got it. Seems logical.  His net worth is $2.3bil.  This means he dipped for about 1/40 of his net worth. Now, $60mil to you and I, be thee bear or bull, is a lot of fucking money.  To a billionaire?  Eh, not so sure.

For example, if your net worth is $4mil you would have dipped for $100k.  If your net worth is $400k you would have dipped for $10k.  More likely to you, if you're net worth is $40k that means you would have gone through all that contractual rigamarole just to pad your pocket an extra $1,000 whole dollars.  To me, that's just not worth the fucking effort.  This isn't new DD/conspiracy in terms of RC's approach or our approach to BBBY, but there *is* a thing I haven't heard being discussed.

""The Next Big Thing"" is the next big thing because no one has thought of it before.  Furthermore, most of the perspectives of most of the people in this thread are attempting to predict the future based upon the past.  ""The Next Big Thing"" has no concern for the past and instead seeks to write its own future, thereby becoming ""The Next Big Thing"".  What if - and this is now getting into conspiracy territory because there are no known facts on an unknown future - what if the ""The Next Big Thing"" is a business conglomerate that *incorporates* meme stock support as an actual, viable, and quantifiable business variable?

Meme stocks are a thing.  Obviously. The next generation of stock market investors, hedge funders, and dumpster divers *all* have to take this aspect into account.  And this aspect *does not follow logic*.  Mostly.  The meme stock investor is a collective *idea* that exists as a powerful and influential outlier in an otherwise ""predictable"" market that one assumes one can figure out using a lot of green and red (mostly red) lines, dildos, and mathematics.  This is no longer the case.

Many have alluded to this by RC creating some kind of rival to Amazon, but even then we are looking at this from the perspective of what Amazon represents.  I'm talking about looking forward towards a possibility *that hasn't been thought of before*.  And how, pray tell, do you think of a thing that hasn't been thought of before?  This is the miracle of the market and the possibility I am supporting when I continue to support BBBY.

This post is going to be bullish on VSCO; Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. While we are all aware of the power of Becky during booms, we need to look at her counterpart Vicky during busts. Who is Vicky you ask? The swath of women caught up in slowing economic times looking to pair up and bed down with a mate during these economic winters. She's not going to college, she isn't reading a book in the park, she isn't trying on sensible cute outfits. She's showing off what God gave her and waiting for you to buy her a drink and cut to the chase by telling her what you can do for her. She isn't waiting for Mr. Right to bump into her outside of a Starbucks and have a meet-cute. She is toxic femininity leaving the bodies of men in her wake as she walks across them in all different types of stiletto's and goth boots that they probably paid for. She's making drag queens jealous with her over the top super-bitch magnetism. She is the physical embodiment of 80's hair metal electric guitar intro-riff, and she is here to rock your fucking world.

First, this post may be starting off as a crude misogynistic take on ""modern ***dating""*** and my username probably makes you think I'm some ultra douche-bag, but my intent is to bring to light the historical effects that economic hardship has on women and how we can profit on it, or at least weather the storm as the destroying dollar made equities only go up, and recession will make them go down. The counterpart version of this DD would be examining why penis pills, toupees, and giant pick-up trucks sell so well in recessions. Male spending gets fucking weird, unpredictable, and comical. Unfortunately, it's that unpredictable nature that makes it hard to trend and predict.

# Trends:

The world was shocked when Revlon seemed to rocket into space after their earnings report, and it got me looking at both tickers. (Rev DD to follow?) It seems that the time is finally here to bring out an ""ol' reliable"" that has repeatedly and predictably dropped in and out of society with every boom and bust cycle. A little known trend that we can ride into the atmosphere as a solid and time-tested hedge towards recession. On top of that, there are a few more booster rockets and factors strapped to the industry that can have some long-term growth potential continuing past this economic turmoil and shake-up.

So, let's kick it off with this:

[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology - Boosting Beauty in an Economic Decline: Mating, Spending, and the Lipstick Effect](https://personal.tcu.edu/sehill/LipstickEffectMS20March2012.pdf)

This paper is from 2012, but it is not outdated. It discusses the historical effects on the spending habits of women during the recession, depression, world wars, and the reality of existing relationships and courting during these time periods. Here is an excerpt that sums up the thesis: ""An economic recession may signal that financially stable men are becoming scarce."" Hitting close to home here chief?

It also states that Men's preferences in a mate lean more towards attractiveness (This is why my üåà bros are so fit and hunky. They know what men like!) The demand for women to compete among each other for physical beauty intensifies as they struggle to find the rare elusive ""High-Quality Male"". That's the research paper's words, not mine. I would just say ""Dr. Job Not-Regarded"" or ""Mr. Clean Ninetafive"". It also states, unsurprisingly, that women spend a significant amount of time enhancing their appearance for their own ego boost. All in all, looking good and sexy leads to feeling good about yourself, and has little to do with men. Which may be why they have üåà guys design all their clothes, and it's why she isn't responding to your DM.

The paper goes on to justify itself by looking at the 5% increase on cosmetics during the great depression, and the shift in priorities during spending, and other times of hardship. It is a messy bit of math and trying to put numbers to old data in order to validate the theory of ""The Lipstick Effect"". This is a term that Wikipedia defines as:

*The* ***lipstick effect*** *is the theory that when facing an* [*economic crisis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis) *consumers will be more willing to buy less costly* [*luxury goods*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods)*.*[*\[1\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_effect#cite_note-1) *Instead of buying expensive fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive* [*lipstick*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick)*.*[*\[2\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_effect#cite_note-2) *The underlying assumption is that consumers will buy luxury goods even if there is a crisis. When consumer trust in the economy is dwindling, consumers will buy goods that have less impact on their available funds. Outside the cosmetics market, consumers could be tempted by expensive beer or smaller, less costly gadgets*[.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mansplaining&amp;ia=definition&amp;iax=about)

# WHO GIVES A SHIT:

What is indirectly proved is an increase in spending on cosmetics to look good. Without a doubt, in this modern era of selfies, Instagram, Bumble, Tinder, and Craiglist, there has almost NEVER been a more competitive market for women's dating. The Cell Phone has created an all you can eat pussy buffet and COVID has slingshot the amount of women looking to hurry-up and pair-up and wife-up into the marketplace after losing 3 years of courtship, dinner, laughing, travelling, and baby-making. Even women IRL are competing with their boyfriends over online THOTs getting paid to wear heavy makeup, play video games or workout with a camera on, or just have big boobs and a skinny waist while they lip sync a joke written by an ugly funny clinically depressed man. Fuck, even some anime cartoons are winning the war on continuing the human race. Despite the 50/50 split between the population of sexes on planet earth, women will need to compete harder as men exit the marketplace. If it just so happens that you are a woman reading this and thinking ""I don't relate to this. I don't have any problem meeting guys!""; That's great babe, but this is mostly about the women keeping in-demand males through an increase of upkeep. Um... give me a call?

Men, Bumble charging you more for swipes and shit is just a psyops convincing you of artificial scarcity. They know that if you can't initiate a conversation with a women in the wild, you'll be easy to take advantage of and pay up. As a confident adaptable man, my very mild rant ends here and this is where it should end. I think everyone already gets it, and there is nothing wrong with a healthy open conversation about the reality of ***how it be***. Nobody wants Incel bullshit comments, and that goes for you ladies as well.

# I WANT MONEY:

This brings us to three important things going forward that will need to be acknowledged:

1. Accept that we are in a recession even though unemployment (statistics) are down. If you think the economy is booming and better than it has ever been, you must be morbidly obese and never go outside. People are having a hard time and as inflation comes down, real unemployment goes up as a fundamental, and there is no true statistic that you will ever get from the labor department about how bad it truly is, because they have been changing definitions of unemployment pushing goal posts for so long it is a worthless metric. It is similar to how they changed the definition of recession, but do that every year since George W. Bush.
2. **You**th virginity is up, marriages are down; and it isn't just about getting rocks off. Single mothers ( [Click for depression](https://singlemotherguide.com/single-mother-statistics/)) , women deep in debt and suffering food insecurity, and other factors sadly lead to pairing up as a matter of survival. Being married is incentivized by the government (one example) because our system is designed to have 2-person partnerships and it greatly reduces the number of people from being dependent on the system. The system and life in general is designed so partnered people have an easier time. The chaotic dance of scrambling for high quality partners in our petri dish intensifies magnitudes when fear of uncertainty begins looming.
3. The current technology we have created has surpassed mankind's maturity. We are a bunch of monkey's with apps on our phone that let us fuck each other silly and tickle our reptilian brain. Doesn't matter how smart you are, you haven't overcome billions of years of evolution *\*Elon\_Musk.JPEG\**. The natural order of breeding has been replaced with the sex marketplace of Tinder just like the natural order of hunting for food has been replaced by the supermarket. The sooner you get over it, the better.

If any of these 3 points are in juxtaposition with your world views, this isn't the DD for you. I like to live in fantasy land too, but I only make fantasy money in there so... here I am.

# VSCO (Bullish)

VSCO came out of IPO like an ugly girl in a romantic comedy that takes off her glasses. It stamped an all time high of $**74.77** ON August 13th, and continued to decline and decline to $**26.14** on June 13th, of 2022. A month before in April, the company reported a **loss of 4.5%** for the year. Since then it has made a rough and valiant effort to come back into a sub-median range of about $49.47.

$74.77 -&gt; $26.14 -&gt; $49.47

What is happening? Why the turn around? Well...

&gt;*""Victoria‚Äôs Secret* ***&amp; Co***\*. *has announced a new* ***streamlined corporate leadership structure*** *that will unite the company‚Äôs three lines of business, Victoria‚Äôs Secret, Pink and Beauty, into a single organization.\*Amy Hauk, who has been CEO of Pink since 2018, will take on the additional role of CEO for Victoria‚Äôs Secret, and the brands‚Äô merchandising, planning, marketing and creative teams will be integrated, the company said.Martin Waters will remain CEO of the parent company."" \[1\]*

Part of this re-structuring includes letting heads roll and cutting staff, **as you do** in lowering inflation and on-coming recession:

&gt;*about 160 management roles, or about 5% of home office headcount, the company said.

So far it seems like the new CEO has really hit the ground running. She is leading Victoria's Secret ""Brand Revolution"", and she seems very fit in this position. She was in a leadership role at Bath &amp; Body Works in 2008, and worked up to vice president in 2012. Also at GAP, and Disney. Part of her biggest ~~challenge~~ opportunity is combining Victoria's Secret with PinkTM and BeautyTM to create a three-headed [Ghidorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Ghidorah) of fast paced fashion savvy first to market monster. If you are clever you'd notice that I've bolded ""**&amp; Co""** every time. Bullish.

Some of the things she is doing include: opening up new stores, finding new test locations, re-modelling the traditional look for a more expansive and relateable product selection, closing down losing stores, expanding to include ""mannequins of different body types"" (Finally), becoming a more modern and eclectic yet agile retailer of women's beauty products and lingerie. She is breathing life into the company with ""stores of the future"" concept which seems to be an experimental concept shopping experience that your date/girlfriend/wife will definitely want to go to.

&gt;*Victoria‚Äôs Secret* ***&amp; Co*** *had 867 stores in North America at the end of the first quarter. That is down from 1,143 in 2018, but 94% of stores are cash flow positive. \[2\]*

Sounds like Victoria's Secret is positioning itself as a try-before-buy retail store piggybacking on Amazons distribution ability! Using the online sales as teasers to get you into the store to see the more exotic selection. How forward thinking!

This sort of agility, distribution, market cornering, overhead-trimming, and safe experimental expansion is exactly what this company needs to take on the world of tomorrow. You may think this Amazon partnership is big, and it is, but you really need to see and understand the even bigger picture. The future of the trillion dollar industry that is ""make women pretty"" will NEVER stop selling their products. In fact, it will only ramp up as more women take back their feminine powers of seduction and use it to their advantage. They can make more money off a tweet than you do all month, maybe all year. You want a slice of that? You want a cut every time they powder their nose and turn the webcam on? You want to pimp these pimpettes? VSCO is your ticket. Going into the colder months, us as animals will begin our evolutionary imperative to bed down for the winter, so expect this next next quarter to reflect the lipstick effect. This quarters earnings we will see how hot-girl summer did. I'm optimistic, but cautious. However, the sexual marketplace is now changed forever. The competition and ""price of entry"" is now so high and low respectively, and will CONTINUE for the foreseen future.

# VSCO (Bearish)

Now, no DD is complete without including some downsides. Only scammers won't admit the downsides to a stock they are eyeing. VSCO is currently handling a bit of a crisis with a debt to equity ration of 15.20. Now, for a growth company a high ratio is to be expected, but indeed it sucks. Compared to Revlon's -2.07 ratio.

[Debt/Equity Ration (High means bad)](https://preview.redd.it/comlzj1k5ti91.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99fd8d2ce90ba2a6277f30851852f2a5fa79737)

Depending on who you ask, high debt is good in time of inflation, low interest rates, and growth. However, VSCO will be increasing their sales and revenue according to the above thesis, and the CEO is aware that in order to continue success, it needs to change quickly and knows that REV's earning are a early sign that things are looking up. Currently, [their interest rate on their debt is 1.85% Which is smack dab average among competitors.](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/EffectiveInterestRate/NYSE:VSCO/Effective%252BInterest%252BRate%252Bon%252BDebt/) You can see that it has had two quarters of steady decline. (What Reebok doin?)

So yes, the stock is climbing from it's lows. The numbers and financials seem to be typical of any IPO stock that is re-investing in itself and picking the right people to lead the charge to take advantage of the new scene. You can say ""Slut, that's pretty shitty dawg. I'm going to wait until they pay off their debt."" Well, it's long-term debt that is rising slower than the rate raises, which means that part of it must be locked at a set amount. Also, if you want to know the secret to making money, you buy low and sell high.

If you want to wait, it'll be too late. I get it though. You deserve that stock that has perfect numbers, high growth potential, AND is undervalued and secret and no one knows about. All the most successful investors I know choose to wait until a company completely turns around to invest and have no recession proof hedging assets **/S.** Like I say all the time to women, lower your standards just a few inches please. There are competitors that sell similar products as the **&amp; Co** portion of VSCO which will also benefits from the thesis. They sell Church-approved makeup and lotions and clothes, but me?... I want the most Slut-tastic one. I want that fucking sizzlin' hot fajita full-throttle adrenaline blood-rush product. The kind of thing that will hook a man and reel him in.

# Entry, Positions, and TA:

Edit: The following was written 2 weeks ago (been waiting to post ), and has aged like wine. Earnings saw a sharp drop and an even sharper rejection. Lovin' it.:

&gt;Been flipping big positions since REV shot up in June. Currently as of this second, I only have 10 shares, at an equity of $398.50. I expect the market to be bearish for the Jackson Hole meeting, where they will decide to doing anything BUT digitally delete the money they flooded into every part of the market except my wallet.I plan to buy a good healthy percent of my portfolio after, and because this is a **recession hedge for now**, options are not being highly balls-to-the-wall advised simply because the stock is mildly volatile and has higher IV than I would like, reaching it's mid-level cooling, and my (awful) technical analysis is showing a smoothing wedge or possibly a 3 month cup and handle (see pic related). Either way, a little now, a lot later is my plan. [Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ibk72igueti91.png?width=1653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3159cbbe977290d4fd32246504f69becd630eb95) If it is a cup and handle, feel free to get yourself some call options out to early December and January. I'm expecting a heavy earnings run-up which is on August 24th followed by an IV crush, and I will evaluate strike at that time. More than likely it will crash into the cup's handle, and then climb from there. I have set dates based on events, but if anyone would like to take a shot at really analyzing this chart be my guest.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Edit: Updated chart showing what I expected.  Monday, we ride!](https://preview.redd.it/0mau4xchdck91.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf05b61b75809955e04a33e5d8249e62b93cd50)

VSCO has a P/E of 6.621 as of writing, and I am shooting for a P/E of \~10 which would bring it to \~51.28 in the near term as the pain starts. HOWEVER, with the growth and restructuring, I am expecting a heavy amount of speculation Jet-fuel to get poured into the rocket which could really lift the P/E to something outrageous, and the stock along with it, but that isn't what this DD is about.

VSCO has a SI% of: 8.4% according to [Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/VSCO/short-interest/) (I don't know what equation is being used here. OG or new formula). This means that smart money doesn't think it is a flaming pile of shit going out of business. (This coming from a guy who is a GME whale and BBBY holder so, don't take the joke personal)

~~Insert nasty joke about the~~  ~~double entendre~~  ~~""TA, Positions, and Entry""~~

# tldr;

VSCO is about to benefit from the reliable and predictable trend of scarcity in the market of suitor males, causing women to fight for scraps (you) using their appearance to give them an edge in a HIGHLY competitive sexual market due to dating apps, instagram/twitch, COVID, and recession.

Edit: Again, more wine.

&gt;My play is to let a market-wide correction happen to enter a hedging position and ride up the restructured business model and speculative growth of Victoria's Secret \*\*&amp; Co.\*\*Also waiting on the earning report to evaluate options after an IV crush.

**Short term goal is $51.28**

# Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Announces A New Financing Program Will It Be Enough To Save The Company?

¬†Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is looking for a turnaround and some new financing may be just what the company needs. The retailer has been struggling in recent years, but they are hoping that a new credit line of $2.5 billion will help them get back on track. The company plans to use the money to improve its online presence, invest in stores, and offer more discounts. Some experts believe that this may not be enough to save Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, however, as it continues to face competition from Amazon and Walmart. Only time will tell if this new financing will be enough for the retailer to rebound.

The shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond appreciated 18% on Wednesday after the news broke that it was in talks to receive funding. But after investors inquired whether the cash infusion would be sufficient to help the firm achieve its long-awaited turnaround, some of the air was let out of that rally. The company's shares were trading at $10.62 on Friday, down 4.7 percent for the week, a particularly volatile one that included Ryan Cohen's exit from his position in the firm.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has been trying to turn things around for a while now, but it has been difficult. The company has been facing competition from Amazon and Walmart, two of the biggest retailers in the world. This new financing will help the company improve its online presence and invest in stores, but some experts are skeptical that it will be enough to save the company in the long run. Only time will tell if this new financing will be enough to help Bed Bath &amp; Beyond get back on track. Thanks for reading!

348,1661491924,wy0n42,1,"The answer is complex, a review of BBBYs financials is necessary:

At the end of the last quarter, BBBY had current assets comprised of inventory and cash of $2 billion, but it also has current liabilities of $2 billion.  In addition, it had future lease liabilities of over $1.5 billion, senior asset based debt of $400 million, and long term debt (bonds issued) of $1.2 billion. On an operating basis was losing $100 million per month in cash flow.  

If the company was shut down tomorrow, the inventory would have to be liquidated, and if it could be sold without any loss  (normally banks assign a loss of 50% when liquidating inventory), the current liabilities would be paid in full.   

The Buy Buy Baby brand would be then be sold.  According to Freeman Capitals letter less than one month ago, it is worth somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion.  

The proceeds from Buy Buy Baby would be used to pay the following  additional liabilities.  

An existing asset based senior loan facility with $400 million outstanding.  
Bonds with a face amount outstanding of $1.2 billion comprised of:
-	$295 million for notes maturing in 2024 plus 
-	$225 million for notes due in 2029 plus 
-	$675 million for notes due in 2044. 
Future lease liabilities of over $1.5 billion.

According to Freeman Capital's letter to BBBY board on July 21 (see link here: https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16311/html), 

‚Äúas of 7/20/2022, the 2044 Notes traded at approximately twenty cents on the dollar. The value of the notes reflects both recovery projections and the probability of the notes being paid off.  Currently, the market value reflects a half percent chance that the notes are paid off in full.‚Äù 

This means the market assigns a 99.5% chance the 2044 notes will not be paid. Since these notes are senior in right of payment to equity (which trades under the ticker BBBY), in bankruptcy, the 2044 would have to be paid in full before the equity receives anything.

Why would Sixth Street bother to loan money if there was a chance of bankruptcy?  Sixth Street‚Äôs proposed loan of $400 million would get paid immediately after the asset based senior loan facility of $400 million. So BBBY‚Äôs assets would only have to fetch $800 million in bankruptcy for Sixth Streets loan to be paid in full.    This is highly likely, so their loan is pretty safe. This is why they don‚Äôt have a lot to worry about in making the loan regardless of what happens.

The BIG problem here is that the BBBY business is losing $100 million a month and fixing this problem is easier said than done.  The solution likely requires store closures.  Even if this happens though,  landlords will want to be paid what they are owed. 

In bankruptcy, a new owner can choose to buy BBBYs profitable stores and choose to not buy money its losing stores.  If the new buyer can reverse some of the ecommerce losses in towel sales to Amazon, and utilize BBBYs brands, trademarks in its e-commerce business, and keep some profitable stores, it will likely be worth something in addition to Buy Buy Baby.   The bankruptcy judge accepts the best bid for these assets, and directs the proceeds to pay off liabilities in order of their claim on assets.  Again, all liabilities get paid before equity.  

Since  Freeman Capital assigned a less than 1% chance that the 2044 bonds get paid, the chance of equity (trading under ticker BBBY) getting paid is basically zero.

Chipotle reported disappointing sales this quarter as price hikes helped boost profits but may have scared away some inflation-weary customers.

**Here's the juice:**  During the second quarter, Chipotle‚Äôs board approved an additional $300 million to repurchase shares of the company. 

This is just their initial approval and there are talks of more buybacks to come. When buybacks occur, stock prices go up. Chipotle is already trading at a price far too high for low income investors. Companies often choose to split their stock prior to buybacks to keep their stock attractive to investors. And that is what's about to happen. Stock splits have become somewhat of a trend the past two years as we've seen with Alphabet, Tesla, and Amazon. Chipotle is a strong company and knows what they're doing. Expect to see a split within the next month. Take it as you will.

Total household debt jumped by $312 billion, or 2%, to $16.15 trillion at the end of the second quarter‚Äîpushing balances about $2 trillion higher than at the end of 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the NY Fed's quarterly report on Household Debt.

 the New York Federal Reserve reported on Tuesday, warning that delinquencies are also starting to rise amid growing concerns over the broader economy.

I know some of you struggle to find motivation with your loss porn.

But owning AMD will give you a reaction stronger than viagra.

AMD beat both on top and bottom lines, achieving 8 **record quarters of revenues**, hitting $6.6bn, with yearly **growth of 70%**.

As of today, both Intel and Nvidia have **MISSED** their Q2 earnings.

**Intel**: reported their **first quarterly loss since 2017**. Investors are **horrified**, as Pat's ""rearview mirror"" statement is haunting him. Their discrete GPU (ARC) is a **FAILURE**. Their Sapphire Rapids server chip for the datacenter are a no-show, while they keep losing share to EPYC.

[EVERYTHING IS DOWN... except taxes and R&amp;D expenditures](https://preview.redd.it/t3xrfh8cvtj91.jpg?width=1774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8132dee859292de04e93d2b901068b386c54a562)

**Nvidia**: just reported revenues of to $6.7bn, a  reduction of over $1bn from initial expectations. They can't get rid of their RTX 3000 over production. Next quarter guidance is $5.9 billion a HUGE drop from the $8.3bn last quarter and **LESS THAN AMD's revenue**.

[EVERYTHING DOWN... except Operating Expenses](https://preview.redd.it/c3mfoiu6wtj91.jpg?width=1704&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afae7ccda8dc43ff271f3db33ef2943518ed92dc)

**AMD PASSED NVIDIA IN SALES THIS QUARTER**

Not only AMD's revenues up by 70% thanks to the Xilinx integration, but AMD  is also entering the telecommunications and automotive industries. AMD is the ONLY semiconductor company that reiterated its 2022 guidance, while the competition is revising downwards.

[Data Center Growth of 83&amp;#37; year over year!!!](https://preview.redd.it/qjgha03mutj91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd82832d651c07aa2fa13f7ed6ee8a45f7265c0e)

**This year belongs to AMD.**

**Breaking down AMD by markets:**

**Client:**  Consumer PC's have dropped as we head into the second half of 2022. The exceptional demand created by COVID-19 is gone, as consumers have the equipment they need. AMD expects the rest of 2022 to have a mid-teen drop in sales, but still record and better than last year's.

**Gaming:**  which includes GPUs and gaming consoles, is getting hit from the GPU  side, as demand drops from mining drops and new GPUs coming out in the next 3 months (consumers hold their purchases  before new generation launches). However, expect the drop to be offset by console chips (Xbox, Playstation, Steam Deck, Aya, etc.), which have a sales spike in Q3.

**Embedded:**  Entirely comprised of Xilinx products is a door opener for AMD, as it  will increase its offering and TAM. Expect this business to continue growing at double digits.

**Datacenter:** the jewel of the crown, growing 83% year over year, is **VERY STRONG**  and continues to take market from Intel. Genoa, Genoa-X and Bergamo  Epyc chips will continue taking market from Intel. This market is bound  to become AMD's largest business next year.

SAMSUNG, TESLA, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent... all major tech companies are buying AMD chips for their products and infrastructure.

To summarize, AMD's execution has been **ROCK SOLID**.

You now have a chance to buy the stock at double digits.... CALL NOW!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**AMD's Stock Price Target: ($120 for Q3, $150 for Q4, all time high in 2023).**

**Remember:** AMD launches Zen 4 Ryzen chips next month (September), as well as its RDNA3 Radeon High-end gaming GPUs in November, and the Genoa Epyc chips in Q4.

**This is AMD's BEST YEAR in terms of product launches.**

I expect AMD to hit its all time high in 2023, likely in the first half of the year.

It is heading to the moon, leaving the competition behind. All aboard!!!

**CONCLUSION**

I told you guys last time and I'll tell you again. I don't like what's cooking. I'm not nearly smart enough to know what is actually in the pot, but I am smart enough to know [most people](https://www.seekpng.com/png/detail/28-283466_pointing-finger-at-you-png-we-want-you.png) don't either. I'm counting on it. Even by reading this far **you are** in the **top** **1%** of idiots who think about whether the [Crayon](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/01/business/01crayon1_xp/01crayon1_xp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp) will be ~~green~~ or red tomorrow. Most don't know or care or have time ~~because they have employment~~. They just follow the trend and listen to CNN. The fundamentals have gotten worse. I don't give a shit what you have to say about that because it is the truth. We are stuck between a [rock](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi) and a [hard](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/us-economy-headed-for-recession-by-mid-2023-majority-of-economists-say/ar-AA11111S?fromMaestro=true) place. If this was a metaphor we've lost a lot of blood and even though the only solution is keeping pressure on the wounds the market has priced in rate cuts.

Surprise surprise, **China** isn't the only house of cards when it comes to [housing](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf) or the handful of other bubbles I could name off the top of my head. Governments of the world are strung out blasting the dealer's phone asking for just a few more hits.. but it's not coming anymore. I don't have a particular catalyst to point to but rather would like to state the ~~apparently not~~ obvious, the economy is dangerously fragile. I'm not saying that BBBY will crash the market ~~even though GME almost did last time~~ but it won't take another global shutdown to shutdown the globe. Funny how 411 seems to be my number but here we are again.

Snowflake (SNOW) will release the company's Q2 FY 2023 financial results [today, after close](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/snow). Think of Snowflake stock as a proxy on the torrid growth of cloud computing giants [Amazon.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn), [Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft] and [Alphabet's Google](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl). Cloud companies continue to post above average growth but SNOW stock is down 55% in 2022. Snowflake sells data analytics and management tools that run on cloud computing platforms.

**SNOW Stock: Biggest Software IPO**

Snowflake's fiscal 2023 revenue is expected to grow 68% to $2.03 billion, decelerating from 106% growth last year. Still, at that size, Snowflake's sales growth stands out.

SNOW stock pulled off the largest initial public offering ever by a software company in September 2020. The Snowflake IPO raised $3.4 billion.

Because Snowflake's business model is consumption-based rather than subscription-based, investors have raised concerns over a possible U.S. recession curbing demand.

SNOW stock is just turning profitable on an ""adjusted"" or non-GAAP earnings basis. The company is far away from generating profit using GAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, which include stock-based compensation.

**Software Stocks Lag S&amp;P 500**

[Software growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/software-stocks-software-growth-stocks/) have clawed back somewhat as analysts debate whether the S&amp;P 500's gains since mid-June mark a bear market rally or not.

A closely watched software benchmark ‚Äî [the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV)](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/-ishares-exp-tech-sftw-igv.htm) ‚Äî is down 26% in 2022. The index has under-performed the S&amp;P 500.

Snowflake stock bulls tout its total addressable market ‚Äî potential customer base in dollars.

""With a robust top-line growth profile, NRR (net revenue retention) sustaining above 170% in recent quarters, TAM expansion  and continued margin improvements, we see a faster path to meaningful free cash flow generation as well as upside to the longer term $10 billion revenue target,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a recent note to clients.

Snowflake hosted a user conference and analyst day in Las Vegas in June. The company said new products in app development, data security and other areas will expand its TAM  to $248 billion by 2027, up from $90 billion last year.

""With its roots in data warehousing, Snowflake has rapidly expanded on all fronts to become a data cloud company,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a note.

At the user conference, the enterprise software maker reiterated its fiscal 2029 target for $10 billion in product revenue for SNOW stock. Snowflake said it expects its free cash flow margins to improve to 25% from 15%.

**Snowflake Stock: Consumption Business Model**

Most software stocks typically trade as a multiple of forward-looking revenue growth. Snowflake is not a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, company that aims to build recurring subscription revenue.

At the user event, the company addressed concern over its consumption-based revenue business model. Snowflake revenue is tied to how much data its customers crunch and store. One issue is that usage could slow during a recession.

Another issue is that customers view Snowflake as expensive if they don't control usage. Some analysts say there's less transparency and predictability than with subscription-based SaaS business model.

Snowflake in early 2022 made cloud infrastructure changes that impacted how customers are billed and slowed revenue growth.

**Synergy With Cloud Computing Giants**

In addition, SNOW stock in 2021 dropped off the [IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/?src=aurljhh#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). The Leaderboard is IBD's curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.

Many companies are turning to cloud computing services as part of ""[digital transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/)"" projects that aim to gain business insights from crunching massive volumes of data. The cloud computing titans offer their own data analytics and management tools.

But the [cloud giants](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-are-spending-but-how-much/) make Snowflake's platform available to their customers. The reason is Snowflake's tools are better at some key tasks, such as letting companies compile, view, analyze and share massive amounts of data in an easy way.

Nearly two-fifths of Fortune 500 companies use Snowflake's software in the cloud as they move away from on-premise data warehousing products from [Teradata (TDC)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tdc), [Oracle (ORCL)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/orcl) and [IBM (IBM)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ibm).

**Competition Increasing**

Further, Snowflake stock hit an all-time high of 429 in early December of 2020. But SNOW stock swooned amid analyst concerns over its lofty valuation.

Whether Amazon Web Services or Google cloud ratchet up competition remains a concern for SNOW stock. Plus, competition with privately held Databricks is heating up. A recent funding round valued [Databricks at $28 billion.](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raises-1-billion-series-g-investment-at-28-billion-valuation)

Databricks, which uses [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/), is expected to launch its own IPO. [Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hpe), with its GreenLake platform, is another rival.

Two former Oracle engineers ‚Äî Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes ‚Äî along with Marcin Zukowski, former chief executive of startup Vectorwise, started Snowflake in 2012. The company holds patents in database architecture, data warehouses and other areas.

**ServiceNow Veterans Lead Company**

Snowflake stock bulls point to its seasoned management team as a strength

Snowflake brought in [Frank Slootman as CEO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-ceo-slootman-ipo-coronavirus-emergency/) in May 2019. Slootman had stepped down as CEO of ServiceNow in early 2017. Former [ServiceNow (NOW)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/now) Chief Financial Officer Mike Scarpelli in 2019 also joined Snowflake in the same CFO position.

Unlike legacy, on-premise data management systems, Snowflake's platform was built from the ground up for cloud computing. It provides 100% of its software over the internet.

Snowflake customers can share data with their partners across multiple online storage systems using the company's data warehouse. Snowflake also enables easily searchable data to be shared among applications.

Snowflake's data analytics tools became available on Amazon Web Services in 2015, Microsoft's Azure in 2018 and on Google's cloud platform in 2020.

In June 2021, Snowflake partnered with [C3.ai (AI)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ai). The two companies will cooperate in offering artificial intelligence tools to companies.

**Amazon Web Services A 'Frenemy'**

""While Snowflake is multi-cloud, it derives some 85% of its revenues from data analytics jobs deployed on Amazon Web Services, which is also Snowflake's biggest rival with AWS Redshift,"" UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said in a recent note to clients.

""This 'frenemy' relationship is critical to Snowflake's success,"" Keirstead went on to say. ""AWS benefits far more from Snowflake spending on compute and storage infrastructure resources than they lose in the form of foregone AWS Redshift revenues.""

Snowflake has focused on six core markets, including financial services, health care and life sciences, retail and consumer packaged goods, advertising media and entertainment, technology and the government sector.

When Snowflake went public in 2020 it used a dual-class share structure that gave its CEO and insiders [super-voting rights](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tech-companies-ipo-super-voting-rights/). However, Snowflake eliminated the dual-class structure in March 2021.

Snowflake had been based in San Mateo, Calif. Amid the shift to remote work spurred by the coronavirus emergency, Snowflake in May said it no longer has a corporate headquarters. It designated Bozeman, Mont., as its principal executive office, where Slootman and Scarpelli are based.

**Snowflake Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Meanwhile, Snowflake reported a loss for the April quarter that met estimates while revenue topped Wall Street targets. Guidance disappointed, sending shares down.

Snowflake reported a first quarter loss of 53 cents a share using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, compared with a loss of 70 cents per share a year earlier.

Revenue for SNOW stock jumped 85% to $422.4 million from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated Snowflake revenue at $413.7 million. Revenue climbed 101% and 110% in the two previous quarters.

The Snowflake earnings report said product revenue rose 84% to $394.4 million vs. estimates of $389 million.

For the current quarter ending in July, Snowflake said it expects product revenue of $437.5 million at the midpoint of guidance vs. analyst estimates of $436.6 million.

In addition, Snowflake said it now has 206 customers with ""trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million,"" up from 184 such customers as of Jan. 31.

**SNOW Stock Technical Analysis**

Snowflake stock went public on Sept. 16, 2020, at 120 a share. At the time, software growth stocks were hot as investors sought recurring revenue amid the coronavirus emergency.

SNOW stock popped as high as 319 on the first day of trading and closed 111.6% above the IPO price at 253.93. Shares pulled back as analysts debated Snowflake's valuation.

Snowflake stock forged a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp) over the next two months. The new base created an entry point of 301. SNOW stock blew past the buy point, hitting an all-time high of 429 on Dec. 8, 2020.

**Expectations For Snowflake's Second-Quarter Results Are Low**

As a start, it is necessary to assess the market's current expectations of SNOW's financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In my view, we have low expectations of Snowflake's Q2 FY 2023 results based on three key indicators.

The first indicator is that the sell-side's consensus estimates point to a more moderate pace of top line expansion and continued losses for Snowflake.

According to the market's consensus financial projections taken from S&amp;P Capital IQ, Wall Street expects SNOW's revenue growth to slow from +101.5% YoY in Q4 FY 2022 and +84.5% YoY in Q1 FY 2023 to +71.8% for Q2 FY 2023. Also, Snowflake is forecasted to stay in a loss-making position for Q2 FY 2023 with an estimated normalized net loss per share of -$0.01. SNOW was also unprofitable in Q1 FY 2023, but the company previously achieved positive non-GAAP adjusted earnings for both Q3 FY 2022 and Q4 FY 2022.

The second indicator is that analysts have become less optimistic about Snowflake's Q2 FY 2023 performance in recent months as seen with the revisions to SNOW's financial forecasts.

In the last three months, 24 of the 36 sell-side analysts covering Snowflake's stock have lowered their respective bottom line estimates for the company. Specifically, the sell-side's consensus bottom line projections for SNOW were cut by -11% and -20% in the past one and three months, respectively.

The third indicator is bearish sell-side commentary on the near-term prospects of SNOW.

Earlier this month there was a [BTIG research](https://research.btig.com/about/) report noting that ""a downtick in recent field checks and the fact that cloud hyperscalers started to decelerate"" had prompted a reduction in FY 2023 product revenue estimates by the analyst. Another analyst from [UBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS) also cut his or her top line forecast for fiscal 2023 on the basis that ""more customers"" are ""flagging efforts to curtail discretionary data analytics spend.""

TLDR: This stock is certainly not a buy right now and for those looking to gamble, puts would be the play. 8/26 150p is about 4.40/share, so I'll be grabbing those.","ZM died after earnings, here's my next earning play for tonight: SNOW",1.0,2022-08-24 16:20:32

What if it was just him saying hey guys look things are about to happen and one fateful day there was a post about his actual involvement..

I am just saying that the media wouldnt pump so hard if there wasn't enough stake to be lost... They tried killing it before it became a thing and then all of the bots came out to play.

Crazy enough.. It actually could be a thing..

This separates any of the current gud thats coming around and directly relates to an option no one talked about.. What if the short squeeze was in fact due to a merger and not a spin off.

It makes sense with his background for rc to do this... He fought head on with Amazon building chewy.. What if his master plan actually is to build another Amazon.. Jeff Bezos is not the one all say all and Amazon is great but there's more that could be done.. Amazon is quite diversified and the segment that has been lacking has been the update for the selling and buying interface.


AMC could have been a key player if they took a look and actually was able to provide the web streaming of movies or other possible avenues give it like Amazon prime video

Game stop and BBBY are avenues for selling products.. 

Thinking outside of the box.. Ryan Cohen's master plan is to build a different type of Amazon using the failing brick and mortar companies that will be acquired to form a conglomerate to battle the likes of Amazon... Rd ventures would be smart to play the activist role to do this..

This isnt the first time it's happened and I think this is the game plan. 

Amazon has aws which is a bigger focus for bezos than the rest of the company..

No one at this time has thought about it this way or posted it at least.

How do you combat a billion dollar company fast? You dont start small and hope it grows to be it.. You take value and merge that value to be a contender.. As long as you have the capital to do it.. 

Rc is a billionaire running under the guise of activist because the best way to pick up these companies is to acquire on the cheap and bring the little man to rally with it building name recognition and loyalty

367,1661292390,ww1k8i,1,"We all saw the ""bullish"" news about BBBY adding 1500 jobs to LinkedIn today.  I looked at their corporate site and found they're actually hiring 1308 total positions between Corporate, Retail and Warehouse.  Wow, that's pretty much in line with what was posted on LinkedIn- were all those positions created today though?  Lets delve a little deeper.

BBBY careers doesn't list posting dates, so we'll take our search to Indeed.  Oh wow, they have 1,334 positions open on Indeed, so far so good.  Hmm, wait a minute, only 54 were posted today, 8 yesterday, and 10 two days ago.  That's not close to the 1500 today number.

But okay, 1500 open positions is still a lot of jobs, right?  I wonder how many stores they operate though.  According to Yahoo Finance, there is 771 Bed Bath stores in the US, so they're hiring roughly 2 people per store.  That seems about normal for retail I'd think.  But we all know most retail is hiring and currently understaffed, and they're hiring just 2 positions per store?  That seems a bit low.  But further research is needed.

Searching Google for ""Bed Bath and Beyond Competitors"" some of the most common names are: Wayfair, Kohl's, Lowes, J.C.Penney, Christmas Tree Shops, Target, Williams-Sonoma, Home Depot, Ikea, Walmart, Amazon, Macy's, and Crate and Barrel.

I'm going to throw out Wayfair (online), Lowes and Home Depot (not the same kind of store), Walmart, Target and Amazon (too big).  That leaves us with Kohl's,  J.C. Penney, Christmas Tree Shops, Williams Sonoma, Ikea, Macy's and Crate and Barrel.  

Lets see how many they're hiring:

&amp;#x200B;

|Store|Current Employees|Hiring|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Williams-Sonoma|27,000|1400|5.2%|
|Kohls|99,000|4961|5.0%|
|J.C. Penney|55,000\*|3600|6.5%|
|Christmas Tree Shops|unknown|180||
|Ikea|14,200|281|0.2%|
|Bed Bath Beyond|55,000|1308|2.4%|
|Macy's|unknown|6863||
|Crate and Barrel|7,500|607|8%|

\*The numbers were all over the place.  Most common were 50k and 60k, I settled on 55k

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so BBBY is on the lower end of positions available in relation to current employees.  But, not as bad as Ikea.  What about on a per store basis?

&amp;#x200B;

|Store|Stores|Hiring|Per Store|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Williams-Sonoma|502|1400|2.8|
|Kohls|1,156|4961|4.3|

|Bed Bath Beyond|771|1308|1.7|
|Macy's|509|6863|13.5|
|Crate and Barrel|112|607|5.4|

Oh, that paints a much better picture.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, but they wouldn't be hiring if they were going bankrupt right?  Revlon entered chapter 11 protection two months ago.  They currently have roughly 5,700 employees and have 116 positions available (an increase of 2%), nearly the same ratio as Bed Bath has now.

BBBY isn't hiring because they see growth in their future, they're hiring because they need employees to staff stores if they have any hope of surviving.  They're adding fewer people per store than their competitors and are hiring a lower percent of their total workforce.  Think about how many companies are currently hiring- if you see that sign outside, they're at worst hiring .7 less people than your local Bed Bath.

368,1661260780,wvond5,1," Tony Calls the Summer Rally

By early Summer, Tony Dwyer began to see the first sign of those oversold conditions. The Canaccord fund manager took to CNBC once again to call an upcoming bounce in the market, specifically in beaten down sectors like tech and consumer discretionary.

‚ÄúWe are going to get an oversold bounce. Sentiment and my tactical indicators are about as bad as they get \[...\] What‚Äôs done the worst could bounce the most.‚Äù

In the following month, that‚Äôs exactly what took place. While the S&amp;P rallied as much as 17.5% off the June lows, stocks within Tony‚Äôs target sectors like Amazon (a top holding in both the tech and consumer discretionary sector) would ultimately rally far more ‚Äî running more than 41% off the June lows in the case of Amazon.

But what does Tony think now?

Tony Dwyer Says Don‚Äôt Rush in and Buy This Rally Until the ‚ÄúFall-fall‚Äù

Despite the market delivering on Tony Dwyer‚Äôs tech-heavy summer rally, this analyst isn‚Äôt issuing the all-clear for markets just yet ‚Äî especially at these prices. In August, Tony Dwyer said in an interview,

‚ÄúOur call is the Fall-fall. So, once we look through the Summer rally (which I think we‚Äôre pretty close), you get the Fall-fall. \[...\] Not only has the Fed not started easing ‚Äî they‚Äôre actually telling you they‚Äôre almost going to double rates from here. So I‚Äôm having a hard time wanting to buy stocks when they‚Äôre up 14%.‚Äù

One week later, following the soft July-CPI print, Dwyer gave yet another interview where he expounded on his end-of-year thesis. Asked by CNBC anchor Sara Eisen, ‚ÄúSo you think this is just the final innings of the Summer rally?‚Äù, Tony said,

‚ÄúYeah I do. But forget about my opinion, you know I‚Äôm about the data. Remember the indicator that we use ‚Äî the 10-day rate of change on the S&amp;P 500. When you have it drop by 15%, and then pivot higher \[...\] the only time where you don‚Äôt have some retest of the lows \[...\] is when the Fed already started easing. Obviously, that‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù

What Tony Dwyer‚Äôs saying is that history suggests the market might pull back from here to retest the June lows, which clocked in at $3,636.37. Tony Dwyer believes this potential second-half dip (Or the ‚ÄúFall-fall‚Äù, as he calls it) will be triggered by economic weakness as the effects of consistent Fed rate hikes begin to take effect.

I view this as another undervalued retail play, again just like gamestop before all the wallstreetbets craze and bed bath and beyond before the recent wsb frenzy. Yes, we know retail has issues from ecommerce and Amazon, but that isn't a new phenomena and some of these retail stores have found their new strategies and equilibrium on sales.

Let's take a look at some of their fundamentals:

Revenue: Averaging \~$19B revenues since 2014.

That's 19 billion with a B, every year consistently.

EBIT: Averages \~$1B, consistently with low volatility since 2014.

FCF: Averaging \~$1B each year, dropped in Q1 this year but I expect FCF to jump back up in the next few quarters back towards the $1B average.

That's $1B in free cash every year to be used.

Book Value: \~$5B year year on average

I expect this one to grow considerably in price from where it's at currently in the next couple of years much like the other retail plays.

Aug 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled on Monday as investors fretted about a U.S. Federal Reserve gathering later this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that is expected to reinforce a strong commitment by the central bank to stamp out inflation.

All of 11 S&amp;P 500 sector indexes fell, led lower by consumer discretionary [**(.SPLRCD)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SPLRCD), down 2.7%, followed by a 2.6% loss in communication services [**(.SPLRCL)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SPLRCL).

Amazon [**(AMZN.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O) and Nvidia [**(NVDA.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/NVDA.O) each dropped more than 3%, while Microsoft [**(MSFT.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O) and Tesla [**(TSLA.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O) both lost more than 2% as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose past 3% for the first time since July 21.

 Technology and other higher-growth stocks often fall when bond yields rise.

After a summer rally on Wall Street ended last week, the S&amp;P 500 [**(.SPX)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SPX) remains down about 13% so far in 2022.

The CBOE Volatility index [**(.VIX)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.VIX), Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 23.8, its highest in over two weeks.

Focus is on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday at the central banking conference in Jackson Hole for further cues on how aggressively the Fed is likely to be with future interest rate hikes.

 ""Powell is going to try to sound hawkish to tamp down inflationary expectations and tighten financial conditions. So that's most likely going to be a negative catalyst for the market,"" warned Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.

Now taking into account the partnerships throughout, for example, Microsoft, Amazon, (Meta as I am sure they are hiding the NDA as currently Meta is testing Blackberry End to End point Cryptagraphy for the messenger app throughout - WhatsApp, Instagram and FB - and their will be a large dollar figure paid to Blackberry quarterly on completion of the testing and implementation), and these are just a few players in the game.....

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut) now why would they do such a thing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now then we come to the next item of concern, the Apple Killer, the Tesla PI Phone, now is this reliable or not?? Who am I to guess, though it makes sense,  [https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/](https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/) \- and where does this lead us, well Blackberry sure did create a great deal of despair when the legacy patent deal did not come through, though if you believe that deal was ever anymore than a jab to blind the investors, so they would give into more FUD, as the inside players are feasting on the insider knowledge, and the retail players are just being decimated, as i am sure if you do a bit of research it becomes clear very quickly the moral characters you are dealing with when you review the board members (one in particular who disgraces Warren buffet by referring to himself as the CDN one). 

And of course this post will get slaughtered by the reddit bots, who are against anyone doing anything other than holding bags, but for some reason, I would like to speak out and tell those who are having hard times to take a look at this, as the calls are cheap the SP is in the gutter, though all the fundamentals are in place, and it is evident management has been burning the books to ensure profitability is not seen, though what do I know I am just some guy who wishes he lived in his mom basement, though I am not that blessed...

**Disclaimer :**

Apologies beforehand for a lot of verbose because of the final newsletter. For quick read up i suggest reading ""Tl;dr section"" ( headings ) and for the reasons behind it are included in the detailed ""Experiment section"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro:**

&amp;#x200B;

    ‚ÄúI felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices slowly and wildly got together and then there was an uprising against the government and the financial institutions‚Äù
    

Sorry guys, I was supposed to send this the day before yesterday ( great movie ) but unfortunately I got caught up in a celebration we are having over here.

So it's the start of the weekend. Y‚Äôall know what that means. I'm not talking about having a party lol, that is for me. You guys have to decipher this long post so that you can protect yourself from the upcoming danger that I am seeing. In short you‚Äôre fucked if you don‚Äôt read this especially institutions and hedge funds. Just for this week please avoid strip clubs. This one's for you guys because you read my post. ( I like to think so )

Retail public especially retards i don‚Äôt have words for you guys. You guys can chill this weekend because all you do is sh9t on my post. Might as well sh9t on this too. I don‚Äôt care since all you‚Äôre obsessed with is Ryan Cohen and $BBBY. So when you‚Äôre finally over him after getting drunk this weekend then you can go ahead and read this post. Could be worth your time.

&amp;#x200B;

As for people asking me why I don't give my opinions regarding meme stocks. Well folks the reason is simple. We are still in a bear market according to my calculations. So it's written somewhere in the gospel of investing that bear markets are the opportunities to analyze value companies, not meme companies which are about to be purge in the upcoming mega crash as an offering to please the gods of stock market.

Yes you ‚ÄúYou-tube‚Äù folks the crash hasn‚Äôt even started yet. We still have -53% to go from here till March 2023 as my base case. Don't even ask me about my worst case. For that just open the Dow Jones 1929-1932 chart.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr and Td;du folks : ( Too long didn't read, Too dumb didn‚Äôt understand )**

We have already discussed this : Buy 4 months/2 months/1 months puts i.e Dec 30/Oct 29/Sept 29 at the money with strike price near about ""200 day moving average = 200dMA"" in $SPY last week of august if it comes. 

It already did one time on August 16 and i think the top is already in. So you‚Äôre gonna profit regardless.

Invalidation would be three white soldier candles above 200dMA of course in daily chart. For positions go scroll down. ( I will make you work for it at-least. xD )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[We have a long way to go friends.](https://preview.redd.it/vacale5b52j91.png?width=1643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b3152d06dfbe35d8a9ca145d06fb6271cfe08b)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now for those folks who want a detailed explanation about everything let‚Äôs dive in.

**Respected Traders and Investors,**

&amp;#x200B;

How are you guys doing? It‚Äôs been a long time hasn‚Äôt it. God I was gone for a while and had Ni-san use my Reddit account for a few days. First of all, I'm gonna apologize for the Shzio post by my brother Itachi. Man, it felt like it messed up my brains for a while there. It was so damn trippy.  So I highly highly advise you guys not to go and read it a second time. Please, it's for your own health. 

Regardless i love my brother analysis coz he thinks like no other normal people do in the world of trading/investing. So, I take full responsibility for my actions and if things don't go as planned out in the above charts ( i.e the mega crash doesn‚Äôt happen you know ) then you‚Äôre not gonna hear from us.

P.s. We promised you that we will do these posts only in bear markets. Even if the USA goes into depression for 10 to 15 years we will post in a week or two until we visit ath ( all time high ) once again. One may ask why not do this stuff in the bull market? Guys you have to understand we are not bull market specialists. For bull markets it's generally advised to follow moon boys on twitter, tik-tok, You-tube etc. They are more educated and well informed than us in that department with a huge audience behind them. ( They spend so much on marketing lol )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Recap : Predictions 2022 so far.**

I don‚Äôt usually like to do this because my readers already know about this but it‚Äôs time to back-test how accurate we ( i.e. me and my brother ) have been this whole time especially to show random people who are new to reading these kinds of posts especially when it‚Äôs season finale.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* We predicted the March 16 post Fomc rally.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6n7xv1xs52j91.png?width=1851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef518b9218d0bc29d830fc61927009ece8a66438

* We predicted the April top. Thought it was gonna last two to three days more but it lasted just one.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ictvxtex52j91.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1905d15b9028016b853e12dd817097c285d2eac7

* Then we predicted June Fomc bottom which we already mentioned in our first letter. Does ‚ÄúDante cash deployment $SPX $3600-3700 at trend based 1 fib‚Äù ring a bell. ( But then later i said to just sell above 2% because Cpi 8.8% est and Atlanta Fed Gdp -2.1% est scared the sh9t out of me and i changed my strategy from ""Riding to the top of the Bear market rally"" to ""Shorting at the top of bear market rally"" )

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/brojy4p462j91.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a96db2532fe7643a3b03e3f2293102e8c28a06e2

* And now we finally did the same for August top at 15/16 i.e. 200dMA/ 50-61.8% fib retrace which is just a follow up to above June Fomc bottom. post.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/da60ccei62j91.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9e342a4a1f31b7ed9cd4931c8511bdd9368ae5

&amp;#x200B;

And then there were bond, commodity, Dxy calls that we are not even mentioning.

What this all means is that the stock markets have been performing as we had hoped for since February which is like 6-7 months ago. So i guess we are not a broken clock and actually do provide the exact days or should i say the time horizon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Am I a member of secret society i.e. ""Illuminati‚Äù or have contacts in ""Pay pal mafia"" ?**

No guys. I am not a member of secret society nor do i have any contacts. My brother do though. I do want to manage the portfolio of wealthy clients like my brother someday but I'm too lazy. I just want to take bets and watch anime and Tv shows my entire life. I just finished West world and now i guess i will watch episode 1 of ‚ÄúHouse of dragons‚Äù. ( Why did that producer said bad things about Emilia. Hmm ) As for anime recommendation man its getting hard to find good ones. I'm just waiting for Chainsaw man now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**About my self.**

Before all of this I was a Computer Science student whose only good skill was learning a hybrid application development platform called Flutter ( By Google ) but now I just write detailed and boring posts on Wall Street bets about anything that comes to my mind for you guys. My predictions come right because of you folks so thank you for taking trades and also I just basically copy pasted 2008 charts ( 32nd death week ) like I do with Git-hub while programming.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Now will I be wrong in the future?**

Of course I will be. I‚Äôm no economist. I just make cases i.e stock market = 1972-73 or 2008 and just bet on them. Also a big hedge fund guy might find my post someday and take the opposite trade against me wrecking people who followed my advice.

Hence i always tell you guys ‚ÄúDo your own research‚Äú ‚ÄúThis is not financial advice‚Äù even though it will be right most of the time. You absolutely should not follow anybody w/o checking out at-least 10 other guys.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why take my advice ?**

So now that we have cleared some of the confusion which I couldn't in my Wsb guest talk appearance you might be thinking why we should even consider your advice in the top 10 folks we watch. You‚Äôre a nobody. Well folks in my defense i would say it's because I gradually improved myself. Earlier my posts were shitty but now they are getting better especially my T.A. And I'm also learning economics day by day. Do you know guys I didn't wanted to write this as final post coz I was actually busy working on other post like ‚ÄúDeciphering Stagflation 70's‚Äù and ‚ÄúThermodynamics in Economics‚Äù as my farewell post. Yes it's true guys the US economy is one giant open system. That‚Äôs how Elon Musk and Jerome Powell do calculations about economics. xD

Well enough spoilers about the next season. I know you guys are getting bored. So lets now finally jump in what i wanted to actually talk about.

**Tools :**‚Äù

I mean the Technicals i will be using today includes :

\-&gt; Candle sticks

\-&gt; Elliot wave with Fibonacci

\-&gt; Stochastic Rsi

\-&gt; My favorite which never ever lies : Pvt(O)

&amp;#x200B;

**Procedure :**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 1 : Forex Markets

&amp;#x200B;

[Eur-usd](https://preview.redd.it/848syozq72j91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14cb27fe26c6818e1afbf67de147c95d735240d)

&amp;#x200B;

**Eur-usd :** Have you ever seen such a bearish chart in your life both on a weekly and monthly basis? I mean as much as I love European countries but I have to say your Eur-usd charts sucks equally much. Putin owns you guys this winter. Italy and Germany are already suffering so much with 10x bills gas + electricity if compared with 2021 so i can't even imagine about countries like Spain, Greece etc. Okay so I'm gonna stop myself now with the pessimism and dive into Technicals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Eur-usd bull traders have to stop this deadly weekly close otherwise the whole world is f‚Äôed.
* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.924.
* Stochastic RSI are about to cross weekly and go down.
* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over.‚Äô
* We aren‚Äôt even testing the Ketlner red upper band. That‚Äôs how bearish we are.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Eur-usd bull traders couldn't stop monthly support i.e 1.03. Rejected it, retested it from below and rejected it again. The double top at 1.24 was deadly too coz you know when we break the support at 1.03 you go down equally much. Hence those red vertical lines.
* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.81487 so is 0.834 vertical red line support.
* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain't coming out of there any time soon before weekly readjusts.
* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat for a while.
* We are hanging on the Ketlner upper red band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say with 1000% certainty that  Eur-usd is going down. Thank you madam Lagarde. You‚Äôre doing such a fine job by selling German Bund and buying Italian bonds. Congratulations to you and your PEP tool (Lol, guys this woman is bat-sh9t crazy)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Gbp-usd](https://preview.redd.it/yh25km1x72j91.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69b5b05bc7239d7a39983d46014631a715cbac77)

&amp;#x200B;

**Gbp-usd :** Well first Sir Mr Bailey. I have to say I'm a big fan of your honesty if you are reading this. I mean in today's world it's hard to find someone that honest in a government job. So guys we know inflation is double digit‚Äôs over here ( heading to 13% or was it 15% in coming months ) and in September the Bank of England is going with 50 bps. So we already know that Uk is gonna have more than 2Q of -ve Gdp. I hope you Uk folks survive considering you're gonna lose jobs, probably go into economic depression because recession is everybody‚Äôs base case even of Mr Bailey. So enough details let‚Äôs do analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Gbp-usd is in a huge IHS pattern but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will go to the upside that easily. Currently the price is testing right shoulder at 1.19. If it breaks then the price will test the head 1.14 and if it doesn‚Äôt break and holds then the price will go to 1.42 to test the neckline. After that we shall see whether the IHS breaks or not. Also the volume is supporting the down move.
* There is no Elliot wave here. But the key thing to note is that if 1.14 breaks then you‚Äôre heading to 0.87 levels. Reason being two vertical red lines should be equal.
* Stochastic RSI has crossed weekly and is about to go down.
* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over. If it doesn‚Äôt break only then you have a chance of at-least going to the neckline.
* The price action has occupied the whole Ketlner red band. Meaning we are in a bearish downtrend.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Just remember we are in the box lock of 1.14 to 1.42 range. The increasing volume is also supporting this downwards move. If i don't take any wicks into consideration then it looks like the price has broken 61.8% fib and would likely head downwards to 1 fib cause there is no support of candle closing. So watch out for monthly close here as well and an eye on higher high volume.  Also don't forget those red vertical lines. 1.72 - 1.42 , 1.42 - 1.14, so 1.14 - XXX. Do the math.
* 12345 was completed in Oct 2007 ( Yah that old ) From then we are in the ABC corrective wave. Elliot wave C is still deciding what‚Äôs gonna happen with IHS. If it breaks down you‚Äôre looking at 0.95.
* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain't coming out of here any time soon.
* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat.
* We are hanging on the Ketlner red upper band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say Gbp-usd is going down. Mr Soros if you‚Äôre listening to this, let's break the ‚ÄúBank of England‚Äù once again. Just for good old times sake.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Usd-Jpy](https://preview.redd.it/onbs70bf82j91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac73e6bdb79823496a0f762e30e2fb467f38af61)

&amp;#x200B;

**Usd-jpy :** If i tell you anything about this forex pair I‚Äôm probably Bs‚Äôing you. It‚Äôs true guys. Even Mr Kuruda the governor of Boj doesn‚Äôt know where the Usd-jpy is gonna go. But what we can speculate is if the dollar becomes so much stronger due to the weakness in the Eur-usd equation then Dxy is gonna pump past 110 and the dollar becomes stronger. Got it. So I could easily play this approach into my thesis by telling you yes this pair is just gonna go up. But I will not do that. Instead I'm gonna play a devil‚Äôs advocate here saying Usd-jpy will go down. So let‚Äôs analyze things which are a total waste of your and my time because I'm gonna reverse this forex you will see how.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )

* Traders watch the 136. It‚Äôs a critical resistance. A clean break of it would mean 148 otherwise we go 125.
* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 and now we go for the ABC corrective wave. A will hit you at 116 and the rest is just a made up wave.
* Stochastic RSI is on bottom and will go up.
* Pvt(O) too looks like it could go up.
* Here in this Ketlner channel we are hanging on a lower green band. That‚Äôs how bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )

* Traders watch the monthly close. If it closes above 136 we go to 148 otherwise down.
* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 wave. Entire ABC is made up because it all depends on the monthly close.
* Stochastic RSI is on top flying and looks overbought but who can argue with their unlimited bond buying which in turn has caused the parabolic move.
* Pvt(O) too looks like it could touch the blue line. If it crosses we fall, if not we go up.
* Here in this Ketlner channel we are on an upper green band. That‚Äôs how extremely bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.

&amp;#x200B;

So since I took the bear case it doesn't look like any bearish to me. Don't you agree? So our devil in devil‚Äôs advocate looks weak. So to fit our thesis lets reverse this. This is kinda like physics or Math kind of stuff where we proof things by assuming inverse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say but I will say Jpy-usd is going up to 148 at my favorite dot com times where Dxy went 120. Hence i‚Äôm selling my Yen trust with ticker $FXY.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 2 : DXY. A basket of forex currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

You must be wondering, I'm gonna introduce another colorful RGB crayon drawing chart on both weekly and monthly. Sorry to disappoint you folks but I'm not doing that. Instead let‚Äôs use our brains.

We know that US dollar Index i.e. Dxy is used to measure the value of the dollar a/g basket of 6 currencies. The Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, British pound and Swedish krona. Now I'm not gonna explain you here why dollar is global reserve currency or dollar has more liquidity so let‚Äôs just assume that.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens now is when Eur-usd becomes weaker, investors usually go risk off and buy the safest asset in the world i.e Dollar. Hence the Dxy goes stronger which suggests the dollar is getting stronger coz european buddies will exchange for dollars coz its very liquid and due to interest rate differentials. ( Remember Gbp-usd is an exception to interest rate differential coz what's happening over there is interest rates will go up but their currency is still losing its strength )  

&amp;#x200B;

We have discussed a thesis in past letters already and came to a conclusion and I quote.

‚ÄúEur-usd is a mirror image of the Dxy chart.‚Äù Remember this for your lifetime. Especially you Gen-z.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn‚Äôt gonna post a chart but then I realized I should for new folks who are lazy to read past posts. Eur-usd breaks parity and goes 0.80 levels Dxy will be 120 for sure. In monthly Dxy is super bullish. And on a weekly basis it's trying to close above 107 i believe. Hence your Voldemort asset class dropped -8% i guess. Right ?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say Dollar or  DXY is getting stronger in comparison to Euro, Gbp and Jpy. Hence DXY to 120 is back on the table according to the ‚Äú20yrs of wyckoff accumulation‚Äù pattern. If you cleanly break 110-112 i must say equities especially the Spx is gonna visit to my $3200 level.**

**Now some Cnbc or Bloomberg guys who stole my research and didn‚Äôt gave me credit 2-3 months ago used to come on tv and say things like ‚ÄúOh in 2018 Spx visited 200wMA so it makes sense that this cycle which is even more tightening compared to last makes sense to visit this range.‚Äù**

**So folks now the Spx has shifted its 200wMA/50mMA = $3500-$3600. But these clowns oops economists don't know that we should take a look at the monthly chart. Once you open that. Your pants are about to drop coz in the last tightening we visited not 200wMA but 100 monthly moving average i.e 100mMA. Yeah let‚Äôs go visit makachev vs oliviera in oct 23rd ufc 280. So if we cross paths over there I will tell you we are going to Spx $2873 i.e. somewhere around $2800-2900 which my close friend Dr Burry suggested too. Hence he sold + he is shorting coz he has relieved every moment in 2008. So he knows what‚Äôs coming next. You guys don‚Äôt.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 3 :Eur-usd  Implied Fed funds 100-CME:GEZ2023 ( Not gonna use Elliot wave + Fib trend starting here now )

&amp;#x200B;

This is like gonna be super high level stuff even far above my pay grade. Only Zoltan can explain this using repo markets but since he is busy I will try to explain it in a funny way. So if you might have watched Cnbc this past week two economists were arguing about how Fed funds have priced in 4% already but one might be saying no it has only priced in 3.4-3.5%. So who is right?

&amp;#x200B;

If you watch ‚ÄúEverything money‚Äù by my suggestion then Mo came to the conclusion that the reason he is saying 4% is because the Fed is doing QT + rate hikes which Mo still does not believe.

&amp;#x200B;

So who is right and what is the right explanation for 4% ?

Imo they both are right but the explanation is wrong. The reason one should present about the 4% Fed funds argument is that in Eur-usd implied Fed funds went to 4%. Hence the market has priced 4% in the euro dollar banking system. But if you take only the dollar banking system in Usa then we look at yields of 2 yr and 10 yr which are hinting that Fed funds 3.4-3.5% is already priced in by the markets.

&amp;#x200B;

[Eur-usd implied Fed funds.](https://preview.redd.it/1e44kz7n92j91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed1184c16108f660d104edbd1ceac6e0b786f46)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly and weekly time frame analysis :

* Both look strong on a monthly and weekly basis. If monthly candle closes above resistance i.e. 3.50 this month then we are looking past 4% Eur-usd implied fed funds
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly and crossed and is heading up while on monthly they are about to cross and hover above for a while.
* Pvt(O) on weekly looks promising as compared to monthly.
* Both of them don‚Äôt wanna lose their lower green Ketlner band.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say that we are going up here technically. So J. Powell, could you please back me up on this. Zoltan agrees with me. Snyder doesn‚Äôt.** 

**( Just remember implied fed funds can go up due to Eur-usd weakness. So its kinda like indirect interest rate hike for markets. Add QT on top of that. Hence Fed is dovish in Fomc minutes for rate hikes )**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 4 : HYG &amp; LQD : The corporate bonds

&amp;#x200B;

[HYG](https://preview.redd.it/xwav70t8a2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b03c2b697eaabdb09728007e8699c1f158e40810)

&amp;#x200B;

Hyg : This product is designed to replicate a benchmark which provides a broad representation of the U.S. dollar-denominated high yield liquid corporate bond market. The high yield bond space has been cracked wide open by ETFs, as these products have offered numerous ways for investors to take advantage of this space. High yields can be a great addition to a yield-starved portfolio, as they can offer yields into the double digits for those willing to take on the risks that come along with it. The high returns come from riskier bond choices who have to pay out higher ratios to compensate investors for high risks. This means that the holdings of these ETFs will have higher chances of defaults, and could potentially leave investors out to dry. But those who have done their homework on the holdings of a particular ‚Äújunk‚Äù bond fund have the ability to generate strong returns from these powerful products. HYG keeps most of its assets inside of the U.S., though it does offer a slice of international exposure as well. The ETF is dominated by corporate bonds, the majority of which have investment grades between B and BB. This product will make a great income addition to any investor who is fully aware of the risks a high yield bond product carries.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* Weekly is gonna print bearish engulfing candle. Also there is a volume divergence. Price going up but volume going down which leads to fall. Trend line break candles will be the nail on the coffin.
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading down.
* Pvt(O) on weekly is also done after releasing supply and now will head down to accumulation..
* Ketlner middle line changing band rejected the price action suggesting bearish continuation.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly time frame analysis :

* Monthly rejected its previous to previous top of the candle and is gonna print another st. down red monthly. Again price ascending volume declining.
* But interestingly stochastic Rsi on monthly going up..
* Pvt(O) on monthly also about to cross its blue line later sometimes.
* As for Ketlner, well it's pretty much occupying the entire red lower band.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

LQD : I leave it up to you guys. Cmon at least do one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going down on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going down because of that deadly candle that folks have been talking about.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 5 : IEI/HYG : Government bond price / Corporate bond price.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[IEI\/HYG : Double check below thing.](https://preview.redd.it/i3bbj0fda2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36056c59d1b790618d5af8006a9bafec16ea7884)

&amp;#x200B;

IEI/HYG : If it goes up then credit spreads are widening. ( Bad thing i.e risk off )

IEI/HYG : If it goes down then credit spreads are tightening. ( Good thing i.e. risk on )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* Weekly is about to print a bullish engulfing candle. Also volume isn‚Äôt supporting downwards move i.e. price is going down but volume is going down as well.
* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading up.
* Can't comment about Pvt(O) weekly. Mixed signals
* Ketlner middle line changing band supported the price action and is green. Meaning bullish continuation

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly time frame analysis :

* No complete data on monthly that we can make assumptions.
* But stochastic Rsi crossed on monthly and suggested going down.
* Pvt(O) flat.
* As for Ketlner, well we had rejection from an extremely bullish green band i.e. we haven't gotten permission for capitulation but we got support from middle Ketlner to make the price go up again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going up on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going up.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 6 : ( Super scary ) : Velocity of m2 or m1 money supply i.e v = us gdp / m1 or m2.

&amp;#x200B;

[Velocity of M2](https://preview.redd.it/63y690uka2j91.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=259b9d0855aacf6aae7f97a74591f5408b1ad7da)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very debatable topic. Only the pros have the right to argue about this stuff and no one else. Peter lynch once told me during my time travel visit that people worry that the velocity of money supply is going up way too fast then we are gonna have depression and if the velocity of money supply goes down then too we are gonna have depression. So which one is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways Q3 2020 : 1.149 was the highest reading. Currently we are trying to break it. Q2 2022 : 1.147

&amp;#x200B;

""The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. This is called an expanding economy."" \~ By Fred website.

&amp;#x200B;

So go out there and ask your banking friends and tell them please explain the concept of money supply in today's terms. Not an old term. So I too went to my brother for advice. He told me ‚Äú F off ‚Äú

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : ‚ÄúF off‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 7 : Gold

&amp;#x200B;

We are not gonna do weekly and monthly time frame analysis on this. Some of you guys may be like ‚ÄúDude, I'm an old man with agricultural land. I wanna own gold like my ancestors from 18th century coz i believe in stagflation, parabolic move, end of the world, negative debasement hedge blah blah‚Äù So i need charts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Old man's Gold :**

Old man you need to chill. We are gonna use our brain like Peter Schiff. So we know, gold doesn't love that his nemesis dollar is going up. Now if you can tell me how high Dxy will go up then i can tell you that the top of Dxy will be the bottom of Gold. Also gold doesn‚Äôt love financial crisis or bank runs. In my world gold is a phoenix who rises from ashes. Meaning if we plunge into the abyss then gold is gonna drag us out of there first. Then indices move and other asset classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Digital Gold :**

As for young folks, you love the King of Voldemort asset class don‚Äôt you? So go buy it at amazon bottom i.e. $4-5k or my favorite Richard heart level -83% i.e 10,690. Or if you really don't have the patience like probably 99% of the entire world population you buy some % of this commodity for whatever reasons these guys are selling you at $20k. I shall rest my case now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Gold down and vice versa.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 8 : TLT/JNK : It‚Äôs kinda like IEI/HYG

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys do this please? 

Hint : Bullish divergence on weekly and monthly. Meaning TLT ( 20yr treasury bond etf by black rock ) buying over Junk bonds i.e. JNK

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 9 : US Oil.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's go Brandon and the government. Just how much are you gonna manipulate the best inflation hedge alive. You guys have already killed my Gold. Yes you J.P. Morgan traders, I hate you. May your bank dies in upcoming crash and have Panic of 2023 just like  Knickbocker crisis in 1907. Only then I shall have my vengeance a/g those rumors you circulated back in the days.

So guys you probably would know this that our Usa Government try to manipulate oil market just to please people and ask for votes. These are some of their stupid tactics.

&amp;#x200B;

* Releasing SPR ( i.e. Strategic petroleum reserve ) in the market.
* Pressurizing Saudis to find oil. ( Btw Saudi Armaco alone made profits greater than all Usa mega cap tech combined )
* Windfall taxes on Oil companies.
* Distributing E.V. credits to people. But even E.V. companies are smart. They instead increase their price. Ford I mean what the f you guys are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the most manipulated market I have ever seen in my 100 yr+ of lifetime. So traders if your conclusion from my above observation was that we should short Oil lemme tell you something in double quotes.

‚ÄúBe afraid of Putin‚Äôs Winter Oil boogeyman‚Äù. ""Contango is a dangerous thing that futures creates""

&amp;#x200B;

You don‚Äôt short Oil in winter. Period. Heck you shouldn‚Äôt even trade Oil. Only the expert can do this because it's called ‚ÄúWidow Maker‚Äù i.e. the losses in this commodity trading could be catastrophic planetary devastation like.

&amp;#x200B;

Tip : Btw currently oil is in downwards wedge and it could break to upside and we go up in winter but Oil too like gold doesn't love Dxy going up. So kinda mixed signals i guess. Let's see who shall prevail bulls or bears of oil.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Oil down and vice versa but Winter is coming/ Contango = Maybe Oil up.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 10 : Powell curve i.e.10 yr - 3 month, 2 yr - 3 month ( Pvt(o) and Elliot wave doesn't work here )

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys remember the talk we had with Powell earlier this year when he was trying to explain us that the inversion of the 10 yr - 2 yr curve doesn't mean anything and unless the near term curve inverts it's all okay. Well folks Powell near time curves are close to getting inverted. Therefore you‚Äôre seeing these Fed officials talk dovish recently. Coz if they invert Fed will lose their remaining 0.0000001% credibility. So let‚Äôs analyze them on a weekly time frame because on a monthly time frame they look super super bearish to me and there is no chance that the curve won‚Äôt invert at some point later on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[J Powell\/ Fed Curves : Us10y-Us03m , Us02y-Us03m](https://preview.redd.it/djrc8jaf83j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d99ee474cadfaa810f9d14a4dd3ac350a9591a)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly time frame analysis :

* The current weekly candle in both curves are going to close lower than previous week which could suggest further downside risk.
* Stochastic Rsi on 10yr-3m looks flat dead whereas on 2yr-3m it looks like it is rising.
* MacD in both of them is showing us that the downwards declining move is losing its strength.
* As for Ketlner, well in both of them they are staying in the lower red band suggesting they are still in a bearish trend.

&amp;#x200B;

Larry Summers former Fed chairman came recently to Bloomberg saying that the Fed has shown in latest minutes that they don‚Äôt even know what they are doing. Hence they Bs‚Äôing us in their statement. I mean guys just read these hawkish and dovish points yourself. Also do check out the hidden statements in minutes which are pieces of advice for billionaires about liquidity and t-bills. Don‚Äôt forget my warning about bank runs. They are coming. My bet is Well‚Äôs Fargo Oct 2022/23 = Lehman brothers Oct 2008 or you could also go with lowest read by a bank in Fed stress test.

&amp;#x200B;

[Hawkish vs Dovish vs Billionaire's \( Highlighted in blue \) Fed minutes.](https://preview.redd.it/omb5j3ws83j91.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6158e6604b455fbd85a1d9a922db7ce00ec1e833)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for individual bonds and overall yield curve : 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonds :**

* Well 10 yr yields looks so good on both weekly and monthly time frame. So we go up in yields.
* 2 yr yields  look so good on weekly and waiting for monthly close making it bullish. Meaning on September Fed is gonna be dead. ( Yields will rise meaning bond prices go down with stocks )

Note : Once again i'm telling yields is going up due to Eur-usd down i.e. Dxy up and markets front running 95B/m QT. We are quite unsure about rate hikes coz its nearly 50-50 b/w 50 and 75 bps. It will all depend on Cpi and Jobs data in September.

&amp;#x200B;

* Institutions and Hf‚Äôs are also buying Chinese bonds like crazy or maybe Chinese themselves because of fear of recession and growth slowdown i.e. flight to safety trade. They have deflationary recession but the thing is they have balance sheet recession. So their government is creating a liquidity trap by cutting rates. But don't forget they can always do  exuberance amount of liquidity coz they have very less inflation. In Usa you're getting rekt in both stocks and bonds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yield curve :**

* As for the entire yield curve here look at these beauties that Powell has created in these charts.

&amp;#x200B;

[Credits : Eurodollar University. By Jeff Snyder](https://preview.redd.it/in4k23tl83j91.png?width=1427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8d4fbef2d512895f7d20db2b348b80b9907ebe)

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Yield should be higher if the time horizon is higher. Meaning shorter end like 2 yr to 5 yr should yield less than 10 yr and 20 yr normally due to unknown risks associated in far future. But look here in these charts. A 52 w t-bill is yielding more than 20 yr and 10 yr bonds. That‚Äôs insane. It tells us there is a danger in next 1-2yrs as compared to far in future. The curve has gone banana's b/w 26 w t-bill to 10 yr bond. After 10 yr to 20 yr curve looks so good and why won't it. Because after the most horrible decade in entire history of Usa will come a little less horrible decade. Haha.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : I can confidently say yields are going up in respective bonds. But will basic yield curve i.e us10y-us02y will steepen or invert more is out of my pay grade.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Step 11 : VIX. It looks so ready to pop anytime.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean what do i even say here. This whole year traders are buying Vix calls in 20 and shorting equities and as the Vix goes 30 they sell their calls and buy puts. Meanwhile longing their equities position.

So smart Vix traders, it's time to integrate the mega crash in your calculations. Meaning do the first phase of second part but leave tf out of second phase of second part i.e. don't buy puts on Vix and don't try to long equity in 30 coz this time folks are going to promised Vix 40+.

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Vix is going up. Reason : It's mid terms + Putin x Jinpig x Biden at G8 = Volatility in Sept - Nov.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Conclusion :**

&amp;#x200B;

Financial derivation = Take those steps into consideration that you are confident in your analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

**So I chose my Eur-usd pokemon.**

Reason : I am quite confident in my analysis and Lagarde. Plus Fed minutes made a commentary about this that dollar is looking so strong as comparison to Euro. Maybe this too played a part in their recent dovish commentary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assuming :** Eur usd is going down coz Europe is f‚Äôed. ( We were most confident about this in all of our steps. Also my birdie told me 0.93 eur-usd traders have risen from their grave in options market )

&amp;#x200B;

**Above assumption ( proving in step 1 t.a. ) will mean :**

* Dxy go up due to the mirror chart theory.  ( 0.80-0.90 levels in eur-usd = 120 move in Dxy )

&amp;#x200B;

* So now equities, commodities, metals and rest other asset class will fall down.

&amp;#x200B;

But what about bonds?

&amp;#x200B;

* Well when the dollar strengthens then the countries who have dollar denominated debts have to sell their bonds and buy new bonds to refinance. Something like that. I think i butchered it. But yah it happens. Other reason being when dollar strengthens due to ext factors then its kinda like a rate hike. So since bonds don't like rate hike they sell off. Now add QT on top of it i.e 95B/m  + Us treasury will issue more long term bonds and cut treasury bill issuance. So 10yr to 20yr bond yields will go up.
* So now remains the case for 2yr bonds. The Fed will hike rates but it's kinda hinting that they won't go aggressive now coz they don't wanna overshoot and bring depression. Hence the 2yr bond will not go up more than the back end i.e. 10yr bond. Meaning us10y-us02y will move from inversion territory to steepening territory.
* T-bills is getting bought more instead of rrp. Hence t-bills are trading below rrp. Meaning billionaires or banks fear about incoming liquidity crisis or collateral shortage. So t-bills it is or cashola. Or you could go to a money market fund and park your money there coz banks don't give you anything. Let's cause bank run together next year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Also vix will pop up in this scenario due to asset classes being sold off

&amp;#x200B;

* The velocity of m2 is gonna go up suggesting economy expands. Nope. Imo its suggesting dollar milkshake theory coz m2 is going down. Less dollars will be in circulation but exchanges will remain same. ( Long shot. I really don't know. Just guessing )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Final Result :**

&amp;#x200B;

Every step we proved above using technical analysis on weekly and monthly time frame is being backed by my financial derivation except one thing. Will us10y-us02y curve invert more or steepen.? Coz steepening is bad for dollar strength whereas more inversion is good for dollar strength i.e. Dxy.

P.s. I think i'm so confused. Damn these bonds are tough to read.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : I forgot Dr copper. Lol. Why is it going up when Gold and other metals is going down?

\*\*\* Illuminati said : ""Coz Dxy move up or bond yields move up is not because of rate hikes. They all are priced in. It's because of pseudo rate hikes on the Global market that is causing dollar to strengthen. This is due to QT + Eur-usd , Gbp-usd going down. Throw Japanese yen in there too but its chart is going up coz its Usd-jpy pair not Jpy-usd. Just like i said before too. 

&amp;#x200B;

378,1661070692,wtuka4,1,"So everyone is speculating about the EOM announcement of BBBY and at this point any positive announcement could ignite the fire and we could easily see $30+ prices.

Some people say that the announcement will be bankruptcy. I kind of doubt it. 

Do companies make a planned public announcement where they announce bankruptcy? Don't they just silently file for bankruptcy and let people know it from the news?

Also, there is the recent 8k filing...

I see 3 possible outcomes:

1 - They announce bankruptcy. In this case I announce bankruptcy as well after ordering a rope from Amazon.

2 - They announce some neutral bullshit blahblah. This means that they are not going bankrupt right now, but somewhere in the near future, so we are fucked.

3 - They announce spinoff of Buybuy Baby. This means rockets and watermelon fucking.

What are your bets?

Since GME biggest focus is building and renting new fulfilment centers the lasts couple of year as big as Amazons that should give them the ability to consolidate BBBY distribution warehouses to reduce logistics cost by more than half all around nationwide.  It should save their asses and boost GME logistic. 

GameStop Pro Membership has over 5.8 million customers.. they can turn that into a new membership program with BBBY that cost more with 2 day shipping like amazon since their shipping sucks right now being delivered in 10 days. They eventually need to regardless. Gamers are willing to pay more for a better membership and most importantly getting their new games fast.  I sure do.

381,1661027837,wtgux5,1,"I was looking at Plug Power and think it is about to go down starting next week for several reasons.

1. Although it might be a good investment on the long run (like for 1 or 2 years until they built their Hydrogen Plants and got them running) it currently looks more like traders are using the volatility to make some money midterm. The Company didn't make any profit yet and the negative EPS was always under the expectations, which have been reduced during the last 4 quarters. 

The announced Walmart Deal in April 2022 gave it a little bounce up, though the stock price dropped shortly after the announcement and kept dropping down to 13$ on Mai 12th where it hit a support line at an RSI of 25. 

2. After hitting a resistance Line on August 15th at 29.9$ and an RSI of 75 it pivoted and dropped more than 10% within the next 3 days. Traders probably started taking profit here from the previous rally?  
PSAR also has been crossed coming from the top on August 18th. 

3. High Inflation has a negative impact on big partners like Amazon and Walmart which might also negatively impact Plug Power

Ryan Cohen by day, Warren Icahn by night

In short, EBay shareholders¬†received one PayPal share for every eBay share they own as of July 8. Both Ebay's and PYPL's stock prices went up significantly afterwards.

Now, do you see the connections (Ryan pushing BBBY to spinoff Baby and then exiting his position - Carl Icahn pushing Ebay to spinoff PYPL and then exiting his position)?

I don't know why Cohen exited his position, maybe he needed to preserve cash for the spinoff and buy a large stake of Baby, maybe he just needed money to buy some goodies for his girlfriend, who cares! He did his job and took profits out while creating substantial value for BBBY's shareholders. That's all I can tell at this point.

Just imagine the value the BBBY and Buy Buy Baby spinoff would generate. It's not a question about ""if"" anymore, it's ""when""! In addition, the float is shorted to oblivion and a ton of FTDs due in the next few months, therefore, the spinoff along with short covering and eventually FOMO from retail will be create substantial value for its shareholders.

I will be honest with you, after seeing my profits disappear overnight, I was freaking out a bit today. But, now I am relaxed and going to sleep like a BABY.

I know we all just got kicked in the nuts (lips for some)by Ryan Cohoe but listen.  I don‚Äôt give a rats ass if you are an Ape, chimp, pimp or simp here is a company that everyone can make some damn money on!
Genius Brands International INC. (GNUS) is on the rise! If you want to do your own homework great, if not here‚Äôs the fucking cliff notes for you millennials.

Andy Heyward (Chairman/CEO)-stated in just one quarter all these things happened:

-company grew from 100 to 900 employees
-grew their owned/controlled children's catalog of  animated from 450 to 3800 episodes. But, now has over 22000 animated childrens episodes under license of Kartoon Channel! 
-grew the Kartoon Channel! distribution footprint from just the US to 60 territories 
-the content is being displayed on multiple platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Peacock, Paramount+, HBO Max and terrestrial and satellite broadcasters worldwide. 
-signed a 20 year deal with Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Company to license Stan Lee content. (Pssssttt Stan Lees 100th BDay is in December and the company will be making announcements around this time)
-partnered with Wolfgang Puck(generates approx 650 million revenue worldwide) to create an animated series as well as healthy food products
-reported that this quarter (2Q) the company had revenue of 22.1 million which was almost tenfold of last years (2Q) 2.3 mil.

Now that I threw out some facts about the shit that‚Äôs going down in the company listen up Fucktards. Something Huuuuuuge(Donald Trumps Voice) is coming. Coming out soon is a series called Shaqs Garage. Not only does everything Shaq touches turn to gold I‚Äôm sure his dick is huuuuuuge as well. He has been very hands on with the series and other celebrities such as Rob Gronkowski will be featured in the episodes. 

This entire post may sound childish(no pun intended üòâ) but,  it seems like it‚Äôs going to be successful.

My question is why he has a say in the company when he is holding bags but not me when im carrying them? The fact that we eat 9 million of his shares means retail ownership must be up to some good levels. So is there a way we can unite and demand change from the company?

If so i have some suggestions. That son of a snake RC wants BABY to be sold. My guess is he might wann get it at a cheap price. Or lets say some other company bought it. Then what? BBBY will be stripped its only modern business model and hopes for future. The company is failing and selling the only thing has growth potential would cripple the company even further. 

Instead selling it cheap now i think BBBY should sell everything else to pay the debts and improve its financials. Then focus on BABY. It wont be amazon overnight or ever perhaps but that kinda shit has way more potential than a failing oldass budget deficiting business model. 

The fact that we gonna hodl this bags to eternity sale of BABY doesnt make any sense to me. We got into this in hopes to make company's market cap go 20 billion or smthng.

Second and more earnestly i know alot of folks here are hurting real bad. I'm sorry, i feel your pain too to an extent but not nearly as bad as you. I hope your okay, i hope you didnt lose more than you could afford. Even if what im about to say is wrong and you do end up at a loss just remeber, money is money, you are more important so take care of yourself and be gentle. You took a risk and made a mistake and got burned. Its okay.


Onto the meat and potatoes here for yall. Ive been trying to think through the issue of BBBY and really any reason why someone would hold and hope for another spike in price to help ease them out of the trade with less of a loss. I'll be real and say its not super great. Lots of debt, a brick and mortar store with not so enviormentally friendly products in the age of amazon and consumers that care about pretending to be enviormentally friendly mixed with ever shrinking sales with debt up to their eyeballs. Its a pretty junk stock. 

However i think/ hope sometime in the next few months there will be another spike. NO, this wont be to the moon, but it may ease the sting of some of the pain those of you with shares who bought in high. So my thinking here goes like this, during the holiday season shitty bougie retail stores like bed bath and beyond do see an uptick in sales. You can look at the chart and see this somewhat as theres large jumps in the end of November going into feburary (although 1. Past performance isnt an indicator of future performance and 2. That hasnt always been true). If this spike comes it MAY get into the mid to high teens but i really doubt it would even touch 20. The catch is i think this genuinely may be a last chance out and even then it has to come before they declare bankruptcy which may be soon considering they hired a lawfirm for that. Its also worth mentioning holiday spending could be a bit lean this season due to inflation fucking with folks spending power.

Full disclosure: im not a finacial advisor, i hope to not have any stake in bbby by end of day tmmrw and barring that (as in my call doesnt get exercised) i would honestly sell more covered calls with the hopes of getting out and abusing whatever IV is left to get a tasty premium.

GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen has announced plans to sell his meme stock holdings, with Bed Bath and Beyond share prices declining more than 15% in after-market trading.

Within the next 90 days, RC Ventures plans to sell its entire 11.8% stake in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond that it currently owns.

An investment firm must give notice about a planned sale if it or its affiliates plan to sell over 5,000 shares or $50,000 worth of stock that hasn‚Äôt been registered through other filings.

Mr. Cohen announced he had a large investment in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond through RC Ventures at the beginning of March.

The GameStop chairman, who also founded online pet store Chewy, wrote a letter to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond‚Äôs management around the time of their initial investment urging changes at the company. 

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock rose as a result of the company's proactive stance, and it eventually hit a high of over $27 in late March. The share price then dropped as investors began to take risks off the table. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has since recovered following the stock market's resurgence over the previous month.

&amp;#x200B;

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stocks have multiplied more than four times in value over the last month due to a resurgence in meme stock popularity. According to Ape Wisdom, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has been one of the most talked about companies on Reddit's Wall Street Bets forum for weeks now.

On Monday, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock rose after it was revealed in regulatory filings that Cohen had bought over 9.4 million shares of the company through RC Ventures. This included more than 1.6 million distant out-of-the-money call options with strike prices between $60 and $80.

When an investor buys a call option, they are betting the stock price will increase.  If the strike price is $80 and Monday's closing price was only $16 per share, it appears as though Cohen thinks the stock could make a large jump soon.

¬†Cohen's decision to sell his shares in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was influenced by the company's low stock price and the recent meme trend. While this news leaves some meme traders behind, it may be a sign of good things to come for the home goods retailer. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has been struggling to keep up with online retailers like Amazon, but Cohen's involvement could help the company compete in the digital age. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock may rebound in the future as the company implements Cohen's vision, so meme traders shouldn't give up on the stock just yet.

Him filing FORM 144 means if anything that he and he alone decides what to do with his shares, and could also mean that we are in for a parabolic ride as the Squeeze will probably happen within 90-days. 

**Here is a DD-BulletList on why i am LONG in Bed Bath and Beyond.** 

* Ryan Cohen's average buy in price for 10% of BBBY: 15.74usd a share. RC owns Call-options at 60, 70 and 80usd. These Call-Options constitutes about 1.6 million shares. Currently he owns a bit over 11% of the company. He also has 3 of his people on the board from RC Ventures. HE DID NOT SELL HIS SHARES. Read up on Form 144 that is pretty much REQUIRED by the SEC. 
* Bed Bath and Beyond is a world famous brand. Branding alone is at the level of Walmart and Starbucks in the United States and the Americas. This cannot be underestimated for any Deep-value Play. 
* The value of BBBY:s assets alone makes it a 25usd dollar company (without the squeeze and Ryan Cohens plan for an Amazon-style business, as a current ""Brick and Mortar""-Business). 
* **Buy Buy Baby**, daughter company of BBBY, is alone estimated to be worth over 1 billion dollars. Ryan Cohen however, believes that ""Buy Buy Baby"" is even worth more, potentially SEVERAL billion dollars, and that current valuation models are flawed. He is thinking in the terms of ""Buy Buy Baby"" as a potential online retailer and not just a ""Brick and Mortar""- Company. 
* Remember Gamestops new valuation when it was no longer classified as a ""Brick and Mortar"" Company but also as an emerging online retailer? 175usd a share pre-split prices, and its roughly there Gamestop is today with a marketcap of 12 billion dollars at a 40usd a share. What will BBBY:s new valuation be when its announced that its focusing more on an online market? , 80usd a share? 120 usd a share, 250usd a share?
* At 26 dollars a share (down to 20usd(!) now after the Short-Attack + FUD ,god people are dumb), the marketcap of BBBY is currently 1.5 billion dollars. Current marketcap for Gamestop is about 12 billion dollars (as just mentioned)...
* ... And NOW things get interesting, BBBY has a revenue of 8 billion dollars annually. Gamestops has a revenue of 6 billion annually. BBBY has 25% higher revenue than GME at a 1/7 of the price.

**I will repeat:**

# BBBY has 25% higher revenue per year than GME at a 1/7 of the price.

**Business Overview**

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is an American based home and kitchen retail chain that sells things you would need for your bedroom, kitchen, or dorm room.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was a struggling niche retail chain that experienced the ""Amazon Effect"" when Cohen bought his initial stake.
However, the company is beginning its current turnaround with new CEO Sue Grove. She¬†bought¬†50,000 BBBY shares under $5 and could help transform the company's declining revenue and same-store sales.

In¬†Q1 2022, BBBY comparable same-store sales fell 24% and revenue fell to $1.46 billion. The company is drowning in $3.28 billion in debt with only $107 million in cash on its balance sheet.

BBBY soared to $30 in March 2022, but hasn't hit that point yet.

So what caused the March 2022 BBBY stock price?
A billionaire activist investor bought a huge stake in the company.
His name is Ryan Cohen.

**The Ryan Cohen Effect**

Ryan Cohen¬†is a Canadian billionaire activist investor who is famously known for his helping hand in the GME stock boom last year.

He¬†purchased¬†7,780,000 BBBY shares with 16,701 call options expiring on January 20 2023 at $60 to $80 strike prices.
If exercised, Ryan Cohen would own 9,450,100 BBBY shares, giving him an 11.8% stake in the company.

BBBY stock has many similarities to the GME squeeze, so I've gone all in on the stock:

*Both BBBY and GME stock traded as low as $5

*Ryan Cohen only owns 2 stocks in his RC Ventures portfolio: GME and BBBY

*Retail investors got behind GME to send it to the moon. BBBY is gaining massive social media attention recently.

*GME had a high short interest and got bashed in mainstream media before the squeeze happened. Many media pundits (Jim Cramer) are now attacking BBBY.

*GME had 76 million shares outstanding in January 2021 before the 2022 4 to 1 stock split. BBBY has 75 million shares outstanding as of August 2022.

The similarities are frightening but what I like the most is that Ryan Cohen is a long term investor and hasn't sold a single BBBY share or call option.

His average BBBY cost basis is $15.34 yet BBBY shares are trading at a 16% discount as of August 15 2022.
That means savvy investors can open a BBBY position at a cheaper price than Cohen did back in March 2022.
It's likely not too late to invest in BBBY stock if you truly stand behind Ryan Cohen.

**BBBY Stock is Undervalued**

The best way to evaluate BBBY is to look at similar retail companies and compare their valuations.

BBBY stock is significantly undervalued, possibly partly due to all the short selling recently.

GME trades at 15 times higher P/S ratio than BBBY. It's one of the lowest valuations across the entire retail industry and screams undervalued to the astute investor.
I've never seen a company generate over $7 billion in annual revenue yet trade at such a low valuation.

No wonder Ryan Cohen bought a massive stake. Billionaires buy assets on sale when nobody else wants them akin to Warren Buffett's value investing strategy.

**How High Can BBBY Go?**

GME stock traded around $4 then soared to as high as $480 in January 2021. At the time, GME stock had a high short interest and caused an epic short squeeze that cost short sellers billions of dollars.

According to¬†Ortex, BBBY has a short interest of 47%.

GameStop hit $480 during its peak in 2021 and I believe BBBY shares could soar to triple digits within the next few weeks.
My BBBY price prediction is¬†$250 per share¬†with the potential for $500 if BBBY follows the exact same path GameStop did.","BBBY, the journey so far and what's to come",1.0,2022-08-17 13:28:47
402,1660708195,wqep9t,1,"How can I siphon a single cent out of millions of people a day? seriously anyone that can do this would be rich. we live in a society where real estate is the best investment because you can supress anyone that doesn't own it simply because your name isn't on the loan or deed. There are a lot of worthless people out there that don't do anything for society and get paid a lot of money while everyday people actually run society while everyone else is just having fun with their lives. Celebrities, sports players, and people who make youtube and tik tok videos aren't needed and worthless in society.. they just do it on a large scale.

Bankers are legit fucking goddamn broke and don't actually have any money. Seriously think about it for a second.. you're telling me that I can deposit $3,000 in a bank account right now and then that bank leverages your money 100 times over and loans it out (aka they know there's enough money out there in bank accounts where not every single person is going to take it out at once so they can inflate the number of actual bank notes in existence and loan it out to people and make money off of your money). Why in the world can I not take a loan out of $300k for myself on this if it's so secure and pay very little interest? oh wait because the bank does it and needs to make money on top of the federal funds rate even though they are lending out your government debt notes that you have in your possession and have the audacity to charge you interest on it, charge late fees, charge fees if you go below $0 on your account. You're all fucking broke you, stupid bankers. Don't you dare think because we have a society set up to protect the rich and that money is the new form of survival of the fittest that you think you're better than me. Let's go to the woods and see who deserves life once and for all. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-MEF\_\_IOe8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-MEF__IOe8) you're broke bankers.

If you think about it, investing is the weirdest thing, but also at the same time the best thing. Investing regardless if it's good for society or not, has a good utility or not, is good for anything or not, is about making one's own self more capital. Investing or day trading penny pumper stocks is investing you're just hoping some poor old sap buys it off you. Everything is speculative. Even Apple is speculative because anything can happen. Investments are just backed by something underneath. So being speculative or not it's still investing in yourself but it also has an underlying benefit.. it makes a company more profitable hopefully and there for your investment was worth it. Nothing is done without someone else. Investing is great because anyone can do it. Anyone in the world, invest and you do the work yourself or you invest and someone else does the work. It's nice having the ability to invest and have other people do the work, it makes you better off of others' work. Companies and other people's work is nice to invest in people anyone can be a partial owner, but the weirdest part is that since anyone can be an owner.. the have a say in it. Someone that doesn't even shop at that store, buy that product or in any way use such service from a company or use such real estate can benefit.. anyone! I can buy ford Amazon stock and based off how the company is ran essentially force everyone in that company to work harder and be a better company. Driving down your road and complaining that someone sold their house at a lower cost that you don't like and bringing down the neighborhood property values. Essentially investing these days it feels like it would be the same as driving past a home being built and not liking how slow someone or fast but not fast enough or efficient someone is working and telling them to work more, faster and smarter. Writing a note to an employee to be better or I will vote your CEO or want your CEO to fire you because of needing more profit in my hands. It's insane that it's like that these days. Employees and every employee needs the ability to get more company stock to have more wealth around, they need to get paid more in general to live life. What's wrong with a market cap of $600B vs $550B?? They still are a successful company, can take out loans and grow and leverage, but they cannot pay their employees more to buy products in society and live happily. It's all we have is life. what's the difference of someone being worth $1B in cash vs $100M in cash they still enjoy live the same, why can't someone who actually does work to increase the companies worth more get paid more? CEOs don't do 347 times the work as an engineer or a cashier or a desk worker.. Warren Buffet isn't great, he just invested in companies and happens to be healthy. He's just the same old person who thinks Coke is a great company because of cash flow and doesn't care about if it's actually good for society or eats a McDonald's burger each day because he likes the business.. it's not healthy.. But investing is the way to improve society and yourself but it's not always good.

Siphoning money out of people is the way even if you're worthless and just a living sack of dusk in a human flesh bag. World doesn't make sense.

Everyone wants to know what is going on with the market and ""did we hit the bottom"".  If it pleases the court of angry apes I will attempt to demystify:

Pandemic:  The Fed adds between 5-8 trillion dollars in currency, while the whole world is closed created a falsely unaffected market while the supply chain tightens and shatters and reorders all behind the scenes.  One of the most primary markets remains open, real estate and home buying, during the whole pandemic and sky rockets (or can the apes all say INFLATES).  We get a vax and come out of quarantines and suddenly inflation hits everything.  

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html)

&amp;#x200B;

This scares everyone.  Shit dicks and Nozzles de bagga de douche (it's french) talk about runaway inflation as if the dollar is backed by Madagascarian oil (ridiculous, the dollar is the standard, we'll need bazookas not bucks if the dollar goes under cause we in WWIII) and that covers the big money thinking it's time to reorganize the old folio and reinvest their tendies in all the old money places.  This was always going to happen.  

The market ran faster than Harambe towards the light and you know eventually everyone wants to take a taste of the money life.  So hedgies and everyone else took a haircut roughly six months after the last stimmies were sent out.  Bonds had gone back up so why not put a little something away for the rapture.  I aint pretty so I gotta date seniors and Granny gonna need a new set of titties.  They expensive but tendie titties are the only reason my hands stay diamond.  I tell my ladies ""you gotta pick up what gravity put down"".

Now it turns out that inflation is subsiding and being reabsorbed as the Fed has the opportunity to return some of it's balance sheet and oil is becoming more reasonable.  Everyone is realizing that this isn't 2010 crash,  THERE ISN'T A SUBSTANTIAL MARKET EVENT LIKE A BUBBLE THATS BURST.   Everyone that bought a home during the pandemic has a historically low rate NOT AN ADJUSTABLE RATE THAT CAUSED THE LAST IMPLOSION.

# BUT HERE'S THE KEY:  DURING THE PANDEMIC A SHIT TON OF COMPANIES OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT.  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE GREAT JOB NUMBERS AND STILL HAVE JOB AVAILABILITIES FOR AIRLINES AND NUMEROUS OTHER FIELDS, ETC. 

This means that we have a larger retirement class and a burgeoning, suddenly higher earning (because businesses have raised wages to entice and compete) young middle class.  SP, DOW, NAS all turned back near the 2020 plateaus we were at and here's the kicker.  When you pour 5-8 Trilly into a market only so much can spill out and hold outside.  YOU HAVE TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE.  The vig has been working and those divies are begging the oldheads to get planted.  Look at AAPL, it's up almost to ATH and if Eve weren't such a needy bitch it would be passed it (why do chicks only want to eat what isn't theirs?).  The shorts are ready to call it quits and BBBY is proof of that, clearly there is some reversal energy and just like when I see a little 100 pound gymnast walking a bull mastiff the blockchains and NAS makes me scream out the window ""WHO'S WALKING WHO?"".  I don't know but theyr'e both looking to retrace.

I give this an 80% chance of bull market given the present conditions so where to go?

Personally, I got 1000 shares and 3 modest contracts (I am humiliated at this number and I beg you to roast it as I deserve) of BBBY.  

VUZI (3000 shares and 200 contracts) is the next runner 28% Short of the float with almost 12 days to cover and they already are working with Amazon, just a matter of time till the big order comes then fuck the moon I'M GOING TO MARS.

  **Rivian's Losses Nearly Triple to $1.7 Billion -- Update**

By Sean McLain

(Dow Jones) -- Rivian Automotive Inc. reported its net loss in the second quarter nearly tripled to $1.7 billion, further putting pressure on the electric-vehicle startup to conserve cash and move quickly to fill customer orders.

The California-based SUV and truck maker said revenue for the quarter was about $364 million as it increased production and deliveries of its first three models. Rivian started manufacturing vehicles for the first time late last year.

The auto maker affirmed its 2022 production guidance of building 25,000 vehicles by the year's end, but said its operating loss is expected to grow to $5.45 billion, from its previous projection of $4.75 billion for the full year.

Rivian said the figure was due to higher raw material and transportation costs, as well as other supply-chain issues. Rivian said it had trimmed capital expenditures, and expected to spend $2 billion rather than its original projection of $2.6 billion.

At the end of June, Rivian had about $15.46 billion in cash and cash equivalents, about $1.5 billion less than at the close of the first quarter.

The results come as the startup enters the second half of the year, a stretch in which Rivian must prove that it can rapidly increase its production rate and deliver vehicles to tens of thousands of waiting consumers.

The company has said it produced 4,401 vehicles in the second quarter, a figure it needs to more than double in each of the final two quarters to hit its target of 25,000 for the year.

Rivian's ability to hit that target took on a greater sense of urgency as rising interest rates and inflation stoked fears of a potential recession.

The company last month said it would cut 6% of its workforce and slash spending. RJ Scaringe, the chief executive, said the cuts were needed to ensure the company could meet its production goals without having to raise additional cash.

Rivian's efforts to boost sales longer-term were dealt a blow this week with lawmakers proposing to add new restrictions to a $7,500 tax credit available to electric-vehicle buyers. The revisions would add a price cap to current subsidy, making any electric truck and SUV costing $80,000 or more ineligible for the federal credit.

Rivian has said most of its vehicles sell for more than that amount. As a result, the company said the changes put it at a disadvantage to more established car makers, who used the tax credit to grow their EV businesses.

The revised tax credit, proposed as part of a broader climate bill in Congress, contains protections for customers who have made a binding contract to purchase a vehicle, allowing those customers to qualify under the old tax credit system.

Rivian recently emailed customers offering them purchase agreements to lock in future sales ahead of changes and allow them to qualify for the $7,500 tax credit as offered now.

Last month, Rivian delivered the first of its battery-powered delivery vans to Amazon.com Inc.

The company has a contract to deliver 100,000 vans to Amazon by 2030.

Mr. Scaringe has said production is improving at the company's sole factory in Normal, Ill., after overcoming initial problems that prevented the plant from operating at its full capacity. Rivian said the factory can produce up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

Rivian shares have fallen 62% so far this year as the company has struggled to increase production.

Yes, indeed it is that time again where I get to share what I feel is the play of the century - Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM). Following on from my previous installments \*(including the hidden bonus track that the mods removed because of the lame ass $1B cap rule which we are now loitering around, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesktopMetal/comments/uon4h4/desktop_metal_the_next_industrial_revolution/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) along with links to all of the others explaining the fundamentals and my thesis)\* I felt it was time to again share an update.

**Oh, God... not this again... WHAT NOW?!**

Well, little monkey, read on and ye shall see... This week, the company reported its 2022Q2 results - of which the following is of quite significant importance.

\- Firstly, the company reported record revenue of $57.7 million, up 204% from second quarter 2021, and an increase of 32% sequentially from first quarter 2022 along with increasing margins - demonstrating **exponential growth is still very much on track**.

\- Second of all, the company announced during the quarter their **""Strategic Integration and Cost Optimization Initiative""** to increase the pace of ""Additive Manufacturing 2.0"" by **reducing their liabilities, losses and ensure their path to profitability remains on track**. This involves simplifying its operational structure, working the synergies between all of their subsidiaries to maximise efficiency, and continued investment in innovation of their technology - **saving them $100M over 24 months.**

\- Finally, and most importantly, the company r**eaffirmed full year 2022 guidance** of approximately $260 million for revenue, representing **131% growth from 2021**, and approximately $(90) million for adjusted EBITDA - **meaning reaching breakeven and profitability by late 2023 is very much on track.**

The company continues to demonstrate growth and IP dominance in the AM sector through the further adoption of their various systems, and continue to expand their client base amongst various industry leaders, blue chips, and government. Their current client base features such names as **Tesla,** BMW, Toyota, **Ford**, Medtronic, Adidas, **Amazon**, Cartier, Bose, LG, **Caterpillar,** Siemens, **General Electric, Space X, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon,** Airbus, **The United States Air Force, Army, Navy and DOD,** Shapeways, amongst many, **MANY** others who continue to adopt and integrate Desktop Metal's machines into their design, prototyping and mass manufacturing.

**Each of their flagship P-50 Production Systems generates a 10-year lifetime value of $4.3M**, along with the flagship **Xtreme 8K's $1.4M 7-year lifetime value** \- let alone all of their other products such as those in their **rapidly expanding healthcare subsidiaries**, of which there are **already 1000+ printers installed and in regular service globally**. Indeed, the company r**emains the industry leader in metal binder jetting, digital casting, printed hydraulics**, while also being the **only company with mass production solutions for printed foams and FDA-cleared solutions for restorative dentistry** \- demonstrating their dominance across the entire AM 2.0 spectrum.

**WHAT ABOUT THE STONK?**

After the annihilation of last earnings' report on the share price, sending the stock down to an unholy all-time low of $1.26 on a viciously red day (-67%), the trend has been solidly upwards back towards $3, where it is currently testing the 100MA. *(I tried to tell you you'd be missing out on at least 80% gains, blame the mods of* r/wallstreetbets *and* r/stocks *for taking the post down).*

Weekly RSI remains low, and it has broken previous resistance at around $2.65, gaining close to 30% this week alone at the time of writing. I'm expecting a retest of the uptrend around $2.70 next week, and a break above the 100MA to fill the gap and meet the 200MA at around $3 in late September/early October. Beyond that, near term resistance at $3.40 and $4. I feel confident that between fundamentals, float size and short interest, in the next 12 months the stock will reach pre-merger levels of $9-10 in anticipation of breakeven in 2023Q4, and I retain my 10-year price targets. Once again, ripe for short term plays and long term plays. Currently ~~bag~~holding 1,500 shares at $3.35 because my country is lame and doesn't let us play with LEAPs.

419,1660242310,wlyfk8,1,"I've been deep into WBD research since the merger trying to find the buying time and when is the right time to let out a rallying cry. The time is now friends. TA was screaming last week before earnings so I traded May 1 - May 5 with calls 15$-17.50$  and now is the time to get in as a poor earnings call from the CEO provided a buying opportunity (13.74$ WBD). 

This is HBO, Warner Brothers Pictures, DC Comics and all of their superheroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Joker, Harley Quinn etc), Cartoon Network and all of their IP, Adult Swim, Looney Tunes, and the list goes on, Literally the best content OWNED by the company providing it (this will be huge if Warner Brothers ever choose to change strategies and pull their content from other platforms).

it was a very smooth ride to 17.50$ right up earnings but was a disaster due to the CEO missing KEY points on things that are happening and are about to happen with the success of the Multiversus game on all platforms getting 10m download in 3 weeks BEFORE it's even been released, The Sandman show being the biggest show on Netflix but was produced by Warner Brothers and is a DC Comic, Game Of Thrones: House of Dragons is about to break watch records, Black Adam comes out this quarter with the Rock.

All the debt is now baked into the price after that earnings call 100%. If they paid off 4b-6b in debt and the debt is now a part of the stock price, you can now add that percentage of debt paid to the value of the stock from this point on. 5b in debt paid adds 10% in pure value to the stock price from 13.50, this will continue every quarter, and the percentage will be higher each quarter as the debt is reduced.  
Now that the Debt is baked into the price at 13.50$ and the debt paid is added as pure value each quarter, this allows the calculation of value added for FUTURE PERFORMANCE which wasn't possible last quarter due to this being the first quarter the company has ever been reported as a whole.

So the performance of HBO MAX VS. what the other streamers Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Apple are going to do this quarter can finally be reflected in the share price.  


So when Game of Thrones House of Dragons brings back 10m subs from years ago, and when Multiversuses finally releases with Season 1 of their hit game that broke 10 million downloads BEFORE it's even been actually released ( OPEN BETA releasing this month), and when Netflix reveals that The Sandman a Warner Brothers / DC Comic based show is their number 1 show, and when Black Adam with the Rock breaks the box office in October.....  


All of that can be finally added to the price of the stock. I have no regrets so far, I'm holding my calls LONG and hard baby. My only regret was expecting more from the CEO during the earnings call in terms of delivering news of what is to come. The call could have been handled much better, but the assets are still the same gold they have always been with all the bs finally brought into the light to be dealt with. 

 Oh ya, and everyone forgets the  Game of Thrones effect. Game of Thrones: House of Dragons is a SERIES, so the mass increase in subs that comes is pretty much a permanent increase in subscribers that will lead to an overall increase as they tell their friends how they can't live without HBO Max for the next 8-10 Years while House of Dragons airs.",WBD is ready.. everything is baked in and set to dominate the quarter..,1.0,2022-08-11 18:25:10

I‚Äôm tired of seeing the same stocks and shitty memes posted here every day, so let‚Äôs do some old-fashioned DD like before 2021. Alright you retards, are you guys tired of throwing away money on shitcos? Want to make some real money on a stock with an actual future that lets you confidently diamond hand through any bear market?


Then look no further than ASTS - ¬†the Starlink of cell phones (but 10x better)! Why? Because it lets ANY phone on the planet have a 5G signal ANYWHERE on the planet with ZERO extra hardware required. You can lose money on FDs in the Amazon rainforest, you can sext your wife‚Äôs boyfriend in Antartica, and you can even call in sick to your Wendy‚Äôs day job in the middle of the ocean! It achieves this with powerful satellites in orbit that connect your cell phone to a ground station, so you can have service anywhere at anytime.


‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt this miraculous technology require partnerships with all of the major players in the telecom space?‚Äù ‚Äì yes, you‚Äôre right. That‚Äôs why Vodafone, American Tower, Rakuten, and AT&amp;T are the major investors behind the company, publicly declaring ASTS to be the future of the industry:


Vodafone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT8AAOSxMuk
American Tower: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRvLA4YMhL8
Nokia: https://twitter.com/nokia/status/1552653352659406848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw


It does all of this with a intelligent business model in which the MNOs that partner with ASTS are the ones who sell the 5G service to end users (ie regards like us) and they split the revenue 50/50. Projected revenue in 2024 is 1 billion, and will scale all the way up to 16 billion annually by 2030!


THE PLAY: Currently, the final test satellite is scheduled to launch with SpaceX next month, and we can see the launch run-up already beginning this week as it skyrocketed 50% throughout the week. This momentum seems primed to continue in the wake of the market being risk-on again due to the inflation being lesser than expected. 


I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the best part: The stock is shorted almost THIRTY percent, and has 8 DTC due to the low volume that the stock usually has. The shorts are UNDERWATER, and the satellite launch will be the final nail in the coffin drowing these MFers for good.


TLDR: We have a company with the technology of the future, a high short interest, and an imminent catalyst that will drive the stock price and force the shorts to cover creating a massive increase in price. Get on this literal rocket ship to the moon, or get out.

Today with market cap close to cash on hand, any large cap tech savvy US online retailer ( Amazon, Walmart, etc. ) could purchase WISH for pennies on a dollar offering $15B - $25B in public stock to gain global presence with $1B in cash w/no debt. Stock holders get $20-$40 a share. It's a win-win. 

Management started grooming company for a sale early this year with layoffs and add spend reduction, Piotr's departure makes it now official!

I know why you're bullish. Bears are repeating what they've heard from their favorite Tiktok analyst about QE, how our economy can't handle 3%+, etc. When the shoe shine boy says the doom is here, inverse that fucker. But look, I looked. I looked at Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and your mom. I've got mom fetishes like I got 10-Q fetishes, and the generals--the kings of the Nasdaq? They're getting old. They had their best years. What do you think covid represented? The peak of technology. You think it gets better from here? AWS gonna keep breaking records? Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me ""the chicken comes home to roost."" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a fa√ßade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Enough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, ""but that's another topic"" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**

&amp;#x200B;

**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost.

1. The  company has announced that at the end of June 2022 it would proceed to  issue new shares to raise , if I remember correctly, $18 million. We  have now arrived at the end of July and nothing has been done.

2. The  company as I have written has already announced that the results from  clinical phase II are going great, however there is not much activity in  the share price, probably because they don't know it. At this phase  this is not bad because those who buy know there is something. What do  you think?
3.

The research was done  on mice. In fact, the results of the research recorded the fact that  MYMD's anti-aging substance could bring about a reversal even in  advanced age! I agree that it is a research on mice but with such  announcements or even more vague such companies write over 500%!

Many investors are making it too easy for themselves. They see a seemingly ""dying"" industry and punish companies in it. Moreover, they unqualifiedly say that a company would not manage to adapt and become contemporary. Granted, the latter point is often true, but not always, and research is needed to see if this caveat should be trusted.

**What are Paramount's good qualities that make this rating overstated?**

Paramount is an established company with a great track record. I don't even have to tell that to people who have never looked at the stock before. It was founded in 1986 and has been a top player in the film and TV industry for years.

In addition, Paramount has stable financials. With $28B Revenue in 2021, it has made 12% plus from the previous year. Moreover, while it has deteriorated, it is still much more profitable than other companies in the industry:

**Paramount's goal: transformation to streaming business**

You may have heard of Paramount+. Paramount+ is Paramount's streaming service. Paramount has realized, as we all have, that the future is not in linear television, but in streaming. Paramount wants to become a competitor of Netflix and co. and offer their content on the Internet and in video-on-demand form.

https://preview.redd.it/a6nxrfpsrrf91.png?width=1962&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aecfd3f4eef5ba39037b088639acff855a1a876

They are available globally and already have a wide range of offerings with series from top franchises. They also create original content like Amazon Prime and Netflix. 

You can check out the Wikipedia-List about what content they have. Can't post it because of low karma. Paramount+ has already managed to achieve 140% growth in subscribers and revenue.

**Why it is likely that this transformation will work out**

Many investors seem to assume that it won't work. What they're overlooking is this:

Paramount has a high moat. Paramount includes CBS, Showtime, Paramount Studious, Nickelodeon and other networks. Their sports network is the broadcaster for the NFL, NCAA, PGA, and the UEFA Champions League. Despite Paramount's transformation into a streaming service, the traditional part of the business is still doing well and unlike Netflix, Paramount is able to produce and profitably share its content across all its platforms without depending on streaming. As the quote goes: Content is king

Paramount's strategy is to maximize the quantity and quality of its content, thereby increasing its long-term value to investors. The whole thing is described in detail in this lecture. Really really recommendable (available at their IR page)

The company knows what it's doing. To me, none of this looks at all like a desperate attempt by an outdated company to somehow stay alive. I think the strategy will pay off over the next few years, and with continued adoption of their streaming, potential exclusives as catalysts, and stabilization over the next few years, it will pay to take the risk now. Growth costs, no doubt without, but it's a path that needs to be taken and one that I see as really promising.

449,1659647916,wgck7m,1,"Hey, I did a little research on Paramount today and would like to share my findings with you. I think the market is more than wrong on valuation (Paramount is trading at 4 P/E and 0.72 P/B) and also the short float of 9.08% is not justified. Here's why.

Many investors are making it too easy for themselves. They see a seemingly ""dying"" industry and punish companies in it. Moreover, they unqualifiedly say that a company would not manage to adapt and become contemporary. Granted, the latter point is often true, but not always, and research is needed to see if this caveat should be trusted.

**What are Paramount's good qualities that make this rating overstated?**

Paramount is an established company with a great track record. I don't even have to tell that to people who have never looked at the stock before. It was founded in 1986 and has been a top player in the film and TV industry for years.

In addition, Paramount has stable financials. With $28B Revenue in 2021, it has made 12% plus from the previous year. Moreover, while it has deteriorated, it is still much more profitable than other companies in the industry:

450,1659642772,wgaiq6,1,"Block, Inc., formerly Square, Inc., is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.

Consider the fact that the company's stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&amp;P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.

**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**

https://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq

Square on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. 

In its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.

Cash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.

**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**

At the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.

Square is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square's gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.

Square and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.

**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**

In a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.

""Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term,"" he wrote.

Announced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging ""[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)"" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM). Some investors questioned whether Block needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the buy now, pay later market. Block's 2022 guidance includes an expected $1 billion in Afterpay operating expenses. UBS analyst Rayna Kumar in a report said the ""risk profile"" of Afterpay has changed amid rising interest rates and the potential of increased regulation.

Square stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.

**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**

For merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there's still a risk of defaults.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App's direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.

Square is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.

The Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company's subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.

To broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma's tax business for $50 million in cash. It's a free service for consumers.

**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**

With roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved ""upmarket,"" targeting larger businesses.

SQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).

In addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.

Square recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.

**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**

The company's Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.

Meanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.

Square on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.

In trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.

One key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume ‚Äî total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers ‚Äî also known as GPV. It's a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.

**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Square earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.

Square said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.

Financial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.

Gross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.

In a letter to shareholders, management said: ""Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square.""

Excluding Afterpay, the company said ""gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year.""

**Block Stock Technical Analysis**

After its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.

That soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google in stature.

Following its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019.

463,1659368552,wdkkpw,1," New highs in the stock market could arrive a lot sooner than investors expect, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.

He said the S&amp;P 500 could hit new highs before year-end as the 2022 bear market is over.

""When bad news doesn't take down markets, it is time for investors to assess,"" Lee said.

The stock market could be gearing up for new record highs before year-end as the 2022 bear market is over, Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Friday.

""The biggest takeaway for me on events of this week? Convincing and arguably decisive evidence the 'bottom is in' ‚Äî the 2022 bear market is over,"" he said.

Lee's confidence stems from the fact that between a negative GDP print, another 75-basis-point interest rate hike from the Fed, and more natural gas volatility due to Russia's Nord Stream pipeline drama, a lot of bad news occurred this week and yet the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 managed to stage a 3% rally.

""When bad news doesn't take down markets, it is time for investors to assess,"" Lee said.

On the earnings front, despite a strong US dollar and heightened economic uncertainty, companies are reporting better-than-feared results. With 52% of the S&amp;P 500 having reported second-quarter earnings already, 73% beat profit estimates by a median 7%.

Earnings matter because in the long term that's what drives stock prices.

Results from mega-cap tech behemoths Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all eased investor concerns about the resilience of their growth and their ability to manage inflation, which helped drive considerable gains in their stock prices this week.

Lee believes the economy has reached the pivot point where incoming data will be decisively less negative, and disinflation tailwinds are set to strengthen. Commodities from metals to oil to grains have been on the decline in recent weeks, which has already resulted in some price declines for consumers.

I believe, that crocs is wrongly in the same category as the peloton, fiverr.  
It is trading at very attractive valuation, only around 6x this year's earnings. What is crazy for me, if we consider the promising growth prospect and the demand we can see.

Many data points are showing, that there is a big demand for Crocs and their newly acquired brand Hey Dude.  
Crocs have gained a lot of popularity on TikTok - with close to 5 billion views with the hashtag #crocs on TikTok alone and hundreds of new videos added EVERY DAY.

Crocs design variations are endless. Starting with conservative designs and ending with crazy designs and various cross-brand collaborations. Furthermore, Jibbitz serves as leverage for that personalization.

Crocs have high recognition and virality. When you go to the beach or down the street and someone is wearing Crocs, unlike Skechers, you know those are Crocs. This creates interest in the brand. The old ugly becomes trendy and ICONIC.

The economy has recovered and people started to travel again. According to various data points, Crocs seem to be selling like hot cakes.

See, for example, in what quantities they are sold on Amazon in the best sellers category(in many countries) or in other e-shops, or how often they are searched for according to Google Trends.  
America sets the trends. Crocs started their ‚Äúnew era‚Äù growth during the pandemic when people started buying them to make themselves happy and feel comfortable, and this growth has continued up to the present moment.

I think that the company will fully demonstrate potential in Europe and other countries in 2023/2024. It is clear from various data that it is happening. The trend has started accelerating this summer. Many countries in Europe and the rest of the world are two years behind

This growth is accelerated by the fact that travel is returning to normal and Crocs products will attract a lot of attention on the street, at the beach, at work, etc.

According to Google Trends, the search for ""crocs"" in Great Britain has exploded, and this trend is spreading. In many other countries, significant year-over-year growth in searches can be seen.  
What shoes do you think kids and their peers will want for the new school year (back to the school season)?

Which stock do you think their parents and many investors will buy in September, the moment they realize (after the summer holidays) how many people wear Crocs products?

HeyDude was an expensive acquisition. However, HeyDude is basically a more elegant version of Crocs. The shoes have an unlimited number of designs as well, and the moment Crocs uses all its know-how for marketing and distribution, the Hey Dude brand will grow fast. #heydude

467,1659300655,wcyml8,1," I believe, that crocs is wrongly in the same category as the peloton, fiverr.  
It is trading at very attractive valuation, only around 6x this year's earnings. What is crazy for me, if we consider the promising growth prospect and the demand we can see.  


Many data points are showing, that there is a big demand for Crocs and their newly acquired brand Hey Dude.  
Crocs have gained a lot of popularity on TikTok - with close to 5 billion views with the hashtag #crocs on TikTok alone and hundreds of new videos added EVERY DAY.  


Crocs design variations are endless. Starting with conservative designs and ending with crazy designs and various cross-brand collaborations. Furthermore, Jibbitz serves as leverage for that personalization.  


Crocs have high recognition and virality. When you go to the beach or down the street and someone is wearing Crocs, unlike Skechers, you know those are Crocs. This creates interest in the brand. The old ugly becomes trendy and ICONIC.  


The economy has recovered and people started to travel again. According to various data points, Crocs seem to be selling like hot cakes.  


See, for example, in what quantities they are sold on Amazon in the best sellers category(in many countries) or in other e-shops, or how often they are searched for according to Google Trends.  
America sets the trends. Crocs started their ‚Äúnew era‚Äù growth during the pandemic when people started buying them to make themselves happy and feel comfortable, and this growth has continued up to the present moment.  


I think that the company will fully demonstrate potential in Europe and other countries in 2023/2024. It is clear from various data that it is happening. The trend has started accelerating this summer. Many countries in Europe and the rest of the world are two years behind   


 This growth is accelerated by the fact that travel is returning to normal and Crocs products will attract a lot of attention on the street, at the beach, at work, etc.  


According to Google Trends, the search for ""crocs"" in Great Britain has exploded, and this trend is spreading. In many other countries, significant year-over-year growth in searches can be seen.  
What shoes do you think kids and their peers will want for the new school year (back to the school season)?  


Which stock do you think their parents and many investors will buy in September, the moment they realize (after the summer holidays) how many people wear Crocs products?  


HeyDude was an expensive acquisition. However, HeyDude is basically a more elegant version of Crocs. The shoes have an unlimited number of designs as well, and the moment Crocs uses all its know-how for marketing and distribution, the Hey Dude brand will grow fast. #heydude  
How do you like HeyDude by Crocs :)?  


What do you think about Crocs as investment opportunity?",I think Crocs stocks are deeply undervaluated,1.0,2022-07-31 20:50:55

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zajttvqk9fe91.png?width=464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0122e33611f69a7201c7fdebd1aa6ebc16cbde1e

My story (for the 6 of you who care)-

&amp;#x200B;

**2021- Barely green in a bull market**

I have piled away my cash into Robinhood for a long time now. I always felt that the stock market is the easiest way to make money in the long run, being a landlord is tough and running your own business caries a lot of risk obviously. 

With that said, I was conflicted on how to invest. 50% of my savings went into QQQ, the rest went into Cramer covid-recovery picks. Boeing, Wynn Resorts, PayPal. All absolute garbage. Because I use full margin on all my trades, I lost like a good $30 grand on these trades. Luckily QQQ continued to be a rock and more than made up for my losses, but I was upset with myself that I coulda made more if I had just had 100% of my money in QQQ, fully leveraged and no cramer picks. Queue November 2021. 

**The Peak-** 

My Robinhood portfolio peaked on November 8th, 2021 at $200,159.18. This same month, I decided to sell all my cramer garbage and dump that half into TQQQ until my profits caught up with what I would have made just all in on regular QQQ....

Queue the first signs of trouble with the federal reserve. My account dropped by over 30 grand in the span of weeks. I was deterred but not shaken. I held fast. I was a fool. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ysmkhpk6fe91.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=769ff7170add3e0d9e11f1ed75e3ca5002cc3a1c

**The Snap-** 

January 2022 was a bad month for QQQ. dropping at around 15%. Thanks to my retardedly high use of margin (and a special shoutout to TQQQ which was 50% of my portfolio) I lost **50%** of my money, about 100k. This was some terrifying stuff obviously, and I flirted with a margin call obviously. This is when I discovered LEAPS :D Seemed like a win-win, leaps would allow me to ride QQQ back up and not have to worry about margin calls at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xeam00ka7fe91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91d3343fa207db1624e27e83342e971fe923335e

Great, right? It was! At first....

&amp;#x200B;

First 2 weeks of February were fantastic. I had made back $63,000 in the span of 2 weeks. The thing that sucks about leaps though is, they go down just as fast! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Snap back to Reality-**

Mid February to mid-March was basically a drill **straight down 10% for QQQ.** As QQQ goes, so too did my account. I was now lower than I was in January, down to my last $95,000 (queue that second wave in my portfolio photo). I was made even more desperate, as my QQQ leaps had lost some IV during that month and also obviously dropped a lot in value. People were saying that QQQ might not come back up because it has a lot of crappy companies (paypal for example) and I was convinced that the next move was to buy leaps on AMD and Amazon instead. Worked great! At first. In a final breath of fresh air for my account, it once again went from 100k to 160k in the span of the last 2 weeks of March. Everything was great! Cramer was saying AMD was going back to $130 minimum.

&amp;#x200B;

 I was inching ever so close to that coveted 200k number once again. 

**THE MUSIC STOPS FOR THE LAST TIME-**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This led me to my prize mistake, one which would haunt me to this day. The day AMD ""would set me free""...of my net worth. April 5th.

April is supposed to be the best month of the year for stonks. AMD had crashed 13% literally just because of one bearish analyst and because of Ukraine (which obviously had little bearing on AMD in reality). So I decided I was gonna bet big. AMD was clearly gonna bounce off $100 level, as it had 3 times before that year, right?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/twwu8y/60k\_on\_amd\_monthly\_calls/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/twwu8y/60k_on_amd_monthly_calls/)

**60 grand** on AMD monthly calls. This was on top of my AMD leaps.

AMD did not in fact bounce off of $100. It drilled all the way down to **$85**. I kept expecting a recovery, stubbornly watching as my leaps went from being worth 61k to 17k. I sold and at least got some pennies back...

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/14yhbczs8fe91.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6601ab5b5e1d91f1be8e1d47cd53e0622f5bca33

I was in disbelief. My retarded brain couldn't comprehend that this was happening to me. 160k to 60k in literally 2 weeks. Queue the Niagara falls at the end of my graph at the top.

&amp;#x200B;

**Flatline....**

I decided to withdraw 30k of my remaining money and put the other half in heavily over-leveraged Microsoft shares, which were bumpy for a few months but ultimately lost me **another roughly $15k** as I sold them at the absolute bottom in June. That's a grand total of 140k in losses from my peak in November 2021. Devastation is an understatement. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What's next?**

Here's my current thought process. I haven't lost the 140k. I WILL have lost it if the stock market recovers before I make my money back. I rode TQQQ all the way down in my IRA account during the Covid crash of 2020, and sold it literally the day before it began what was ultimately an insane 900% run. It's still 300% higher than it was back then, even after this latest crash. The lesson is to not sell at the bottom. 

I'm back in. 2x leveraged on QQQ. Been working out great so far this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m5rl73z36fe91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1557b26c9c311994dc198d3cbb2ff1f5be0f39ed

QQQ ALWAYS goes up in the long run. These are my regarded opinions. So its time to buy 2x QQQ and let this 11% loan help pad my holdings. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/izxr8vjm5fe91.png?width=814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ad9d68b5bf04ac14ec9d0857531d025d695544

If I have 1400 QQQ shares and it returns to pre-crash levels, that's $100 a share and I recover my losses. It will eventually get back there. Unless people really think 3% interest rates is the death of big tech. Fat chance. I expect at least a mostly-recovered market by the end of the year. Fuck it.

Amazon.com, Inc. (‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù) went from zero to one *everything* ‚Äì starting as a simple online bookstore in the 1990s, every piece of the puzzle seemed to fall into place over the years to create the $1+ trillion leader in ecommerce, cloud, and ecommerce channel advertising we know today, *the everything store.*

Amazon is a company like no other. It was a technology company when nobody saw it, believed it, or even *thought* it. On the surface, it was just an online bookstore. Deep down, it knew its opportunities were endless. It pioneered *cloud computing* with AWS, created the greatest online shopping experience based on *price, selection*, and *convenience*, and designed the market-leading Kindle eBook readers. Today, Amazon sees no limits ‚Äì it operates in streaming, advertising, cloud computing, ecommerce, physical stores, consumer goods, publishing, and *more*.

# Where Are We Now

 It is still *Day One* at Amazon today. Growth in Prime users is strong and same-day/one-day delivery may soon be a reality for many products in most cities. Amazon has also been making strides in areas outside of e-commerce ‚Äì cloud services, gaming, entertainment, and advertising, among others.

Amazon has been investing heavily at the expense of its free cash flow. Management indicated 40% of capital expenditures are feeding infrastructure (mostly the fast-growing AWS), 30% is fulfillment capacity, and the balance is mainly transportation capacity.

Amazon's Q1 2022 earnings report could prove to be an inflection point for the company in either direction. This was largely a mixed report - we report our ""ugly"", ""bad"", and ""good"" notes below.

* **The Ugly:** Operating profit fell 41% for the trailing twelve months that ended Q1 2022, free cash flow decreased to a total loss of about $18 billion, and there was also a net loss of $3.8 billion in Q1 2022. However, the net loss included a $7.6 billion valuation loss on Amazon's Rivian holdings. After backing this effect out, net profit would have been $3.8 billion.
* **The Bad:** The North America and International segments faced heightened costs leading operating margins to fall in these segments to (2.3%) and (4.5%) in Q1 2022, respectively. Amazon has not yet been able to scale back on costs and instead has been ramping them up. Revenue growth was also dire in both segments, growing 8% and 0%, respectively, vs. Q1 2021. Advertising services, subscription services, online stores, and third-party seller services all saw drastic deceleration in their year-over-year growth rates to 25%, 13%, (1%), and 9%, respectively, in Q1 2022. Much of this deceleration is because of Amazon's results lapping extraordinarily strong performance in early 2021.
* **The Good:** investors are now sending a clear signal to management that cost control needs to happen, and soon. Fortunately, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated, ""today, as we're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network"". Costs may scale back soon, but we think some patience will be required on the part of investors. Amazon is large, and costs simply cannot be scaled back overnight. Additionally, AWS is still growing rapidly, recording 37% year-over-year growth. On top of that, it recorded record operating margins of 35% in Q1 2022. We think this is a great sign of the wonderful underlying economics of the AWS business and its strength. Long-term, revenue growth and high margins should result in AWS being the largest growth driver for the company.

Overall, we understand the frustration investors feel with Amazon reporting what are clearly poor financial results. However, with a long-term mindset and more patience than ever, we continue to believe Amazon's investments over the last two years and lead in cloud will prove to be strong growth sources.

# Investment Thesis

Amazon was, is, and will always be a company that puts the customer first. By dialing in on fostering exceptional customer experiences and value, the company kickstarted a never-ending virtuous cycle that started from the very first customer and continues to benefit every customer to this very day.

1. Amazon is a global technology conglomerate that generates revenues from six major areas - Online Stores, AWS, Third-Party Selling Services (‚Äú3PSS‚Äù), Subscriptions, Physical Stores, and Other (mainly advertising). The company has over 200 million Prime subscribers, almost 500 million square feet of real estate to drive its operations, and it is hungry for more.
2. Amazon has one of the widest moats across its main offerings ‚Äì ecommerce, cloud computing, and advertising. The virtuous cycle that begins and ends with the customer is the source of high switching costs, powerful network effects, cost advantages, high barriers to entry, and a reputable brand name.
3. Amazon faces potential risks with Jeff Bezos stepping down as CEO, antitrust concerns posing a perpetual threat, Microsoft Azure gaining ground in the cloud market, margin pressure from growth investments, and competition from incumbents across many saturated markets.
4. Secular industry tailwinds and competitive advantages in ecommerce, cloud computing, and advertising will buoy Amazon‚Äôs financial and competitive position throughout this decade *at a minimum*.
5. Growth and reinvestment opportunities are vast, laying the groundwork for a long growth runway.

# Competitive Advantages

One of the most profound concepts fostered by Amazon is the idea of a ‚Äúvirtuous cycle‚Äù focused on the customer. At Amazon, every move begins and ends with the customer in mind.

The result is exceptional customer experience, which leads to more traffic and product reviews, attracting more sellers, thus contributing to a greater selection across all product categories. The result? Improved customer experience, which kicks off the virtuous cycle all over again.

The virtuous cycle inherently explains the impact of a **network effect** ‚Äì by uniquely focusing mainly on the customer, sellers experience more interest and sales in their products as customers return to Amazon.com for their shopping. As the customer base grows, so do sellers and their product selection, and vice versa.

AWS is the most widely known and used cloud platform in the world, and Amazon‚Äôs advertising segment is gaining ground at a rapid pace. AWS and both sponsored and non-sponsored advertising benefit from network effects.

The former benefits from a vast user base of some of the largest enterprises in the world, increasing the likelihood that other organizations searching for a cloud platform will choose AWS.

Additionally, AWS improves as more users initiate usage of the platform, collecting data from many customers to create a more effective suite of cloud services and innovate in and around the AWS ecosystem to provide an ever-growing number of services to meet organizational needs.

Currently, AWS offers over 200 fully featured services across the ecosystem, the most depth and breadth of services out of any of the major three cloud providers (i.e., AWS, Azure, GCP). The latter benefits from network effects in two distinct ways ‚Äì companies using sponsored advertising benefit from the large (and growing) Amazon customer base to drive sales, and those on non-sponsored advertising solutions benefit from a combination of data-driven programmatic advertising and popular Amazon media platforms, which are flush with users.

Stemming from the aforementioned network effects are **cost advantages, high barriers to entry**, and the benefit of a global and highly reputable **brand name**. In other words, these moat characteristics are all interconnected - Amazon wins because it can offer products at a lower price than almost any company in the world, which gives it its scale, a deterrent of competition in and of itself.

According to Evercore, over 80% of Amazon customers in their survey are either ‚Äúvery satisfied‚Äù or ‚Äúextremely satisfied‚Äù with Amazon, alluding to the fact that the company puts the customer first.

This is an unattainable feat for virtually any company in the universe. We believe these factors contribute to the reputable brand name of Amazon, which in turn helps drive adoption of other services, like AWS and advertising.

Although it may seem that products and services sold on Amazon.com have low switching costs given the plethora of other ecommerce websites and streaming services available to consumers, we believe consumers face **high switching costs** when considering the power of the selection-price-convenience trifecta. For the roughly 200 million Prime customers around the world, there is virtually no viable alternative that offers the variety of products for the low prices and free express shipping on millions of items.

At a cost of around $100 per year, Prime customers break even rather quickly considering the amount of shopping they do on the platform. **According to Evercore research, Prime customers spend 2 ‚Äì 3 times more money per month and shop twice as frequently as non-Prime customers**. Additionally, more than 75% of Prime customers purchase products 2 ‚Äì 3 times per month on Amazon.¬†

We believe this consumer behavior and the extremely attractive price point of a Prime membership for the value it offers (i.e., free one-day and two-day shipping, Prime video, unlimited music streaming, and Amazon Prime Reading) brings to light the strength of the trifecta and how unattractive single-store direct-to-consumer alternatives appear to be in comparison regarding price, selection, and convenience. **Why shop anywhere else when you‚Äôve got Amazon carrying most, if not** ***all*****, of your favorite products?**

AWS and Amazon Advertising should not be left out of the ‚Äúswitching costs‚Äù conversation. AWS customers may be reluctant to leave due to tangible and intangible costs as they relate to the following decision factors:

1. AWS provides the most services out of any cloud provider, making it rather unlikely that there is much benefit in a customer switching cloud providers.
2. Cloud functionality may be similar, but not quite the same between providers. It may cost lots of time and money to recalibrate processes, databases, and functionalities between cloud providers.
3. Cloud operations are massive ‚Äì it is unlikely internal organizational teams will be able to learn another cloud platform and its uses quickly enough to avoid business and operational interruptions.

Amazon Advertising customers looking to leave the platform would also face enormous direct and indirect costs. For one, sponsored ads are hosted on the largest ecommerce website on the planet ‚Äì what better place to advertise your product than a website where hundreds of millions of visitors are already shopping for products?

Further, Amazon‚Äôs non-sponsored advertising and demand-side platform (‚ÄúDSP‚Äù) programmatic advertising could provide a more compelling offering than other DSPs, such as The Trade Desk, given Amazon‚Äôs reach across proprietary sites and apps on top of third-party exchanges where many DSPs solely operate.

Advertisers on Amazon leverage the unimaginable power of Amazon consumer data to place effective and relevant ads across many platforms ‚Äì we believe most advertisers would face internal backlash and reluctance towards cutting off Amazon‚Äôs advertising services.

# Opportunities Ahead

* **Amazon is the best-positioned e-commerce platform, in our view.** The company keeps swallowing up distribution and fulfillment center space around the world. The company has a massive footprint and not many other retailers will be able to compete. In fact, we think Amazon will continue to reign as king in the market it created a bulletproof moat in. The company also has a massive lead in market share ‚Äì over 40% of total e-commerce sales are fulfilled through Amazon. In stark contrast, Walmart, Amazon‚Äôs main e-commerce competitor, holds less than 10% of the market. We believe this displays Amazon‚Äôs role in the market as the consumer‚Äôs top pick for online shopping.
* ***Advertising Services*** **is the fastest-growing segment at Amazon.** Roughly 90% of Amazon‚Äôs ad revenues are derived from e-commerce channel advertising, a niche Amazon had carved out for itself using its own e-commerce platform. We believe e-commerce is a strong secular trend, and advertisers will find value in placing ads on Amazon as advertisers look away from traditional media (i.e., print, magazines, TV, etc.) to areas where more eyeballs can be captured. Amazon is one such place as e-commerce penetration increases.
* **JPMorgan estimates that only 15% of workloads around the world are in the cloud, a far reach from where it can (and should) be.** There are many advantages to shifting from on-premises locations onto the cloud ‚Äì lower IT costs, almost infinite computing power, faster deployment, implementation, and scalability. In a decade when 5G, the Internet of Things, edge computing, and growing data consumption will change how the world looks today, it should come with no surprise that outsourced cloud adoption is expected to accelerate exponentially. AWS benefits from first-mover advantage and the breadth and depth of its 200+ services provided on the platform. It controls almost 60% of the infrastructure-as-a-service (‚ÄúIaaS‚Äù) and platform-as-a-service (‚ÄúPaaS‚Äù) combined market, ahead of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform at 34% and 8% market share, respectively. Although Microsoft leverages its reputation among the corporate community to provide organizations with a full and convenient IaaS, PaaS, and software-as-a-service (‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù) suite of services to capture 50% of the overall cloud market share, Amazon leads where it matters most ‚Äì IaaS and PaaS, which will both experience growth of over 25% through 2024 while SaaS grows at about half the CAGR. **We believe AWS will maintain its lead and continue to capture a significant portion of the growing TAM** for the following reasons:  


1. AWS has significantly more services, features within those services, and the deepest functionality within those services than any other cloud provider.
2. AWS has the strongest reputation and largest network of users among the top three cloud providers. The AWS Partner Network (‚ÄúAPN‚Äù) is robust and fosters a community of partners that build AWS-derived solutions for sale through the platform. More than 90% of Fortune 100 companies and most of the Fortune 500 companies use the APN.
3. AWS has the longest track record of operational expertise as the longest serving cloud provider while consistently growing and maintaining the first-place spot in the IaaS / PaaS market.
4. AWS has the largest network of global cloud infrastructure, playing into the technological trends which can only be enabled with low latency and massive computing power.

* **Amazon's Prime membership is, quite frankly, one of the best consumer value propositions out there today**. The service varies in pricing by country. Using the US Amazon Prime membership as a proxy, the membership only costs $139 per year, or $14.99 per month. Considering all [these benefits](https://www.amazon.com/primeinsider/about), anyone interested in a Prime membership for any purpose is likely to find high value in many of the other perks. For example, someone who would like a Prime Video membership can pay a few dollars more each month to gain access to everything else. On the delivery side, the payback period for a year's worth of Prime is extremely short ‚Äî depending how much one values their time, it could pay off within a few orders. At most, it will pay off after about 14 orders in a year, assuming one-day delivery costs $10 per order, on average. It's easy to rack up more than 14 orders per year. In fact, the average Prime member orders 24 times each year and for an average total of $1,400. Think about it ‚Äî everyday items, like shampoo or deodorant, and gifts, gadgets and accessories, non-perishable food items, grocery and prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and health goods, and plenty more are purchased many times throughout the year. The average Prime member actually saves money and our most value asset, time, and gets everything else ‚Äî Prime Video, Music, Reading, Photo Storage, etc. ‚Äî for free.
* **Amazon is pulling the optionality levers available to the company.** Amazon recently closed on its $8.5-billion acquisition of MGM, which opens up a catalogue of over 4,000 movies and 17,000 shows, including James Bond and the Rocky franchises. More important than the existing catalogue is the intellectual property at MGM that will help Amazon beef up its content on Prime Video. Outside of Prime Video, Amazon is dabbling with luxury stores, physical pharmacy, Amazon Go, and plenty of other things we do not yet know about over the next 5 - 10 years.

# Risks

Amazon established a wide moat across several markets, but its moat does not protect it from all forces ‚Äì internal or exogenous. We believe the factors presented below represent some of the greatest risk to Amazon‚Äôs financial, operational, or competitive positions across all time frames:

* Amazon operates across many saturated markets and faces competition from well-established incumbents in each area (ex. Streaming ‚Äì Disney+ and Netflix; Physical Stores ‚Äì Costco and Walmart; 3PSS ‚Äì Etsy, eBay). Lack of focus, poor strategic moves, and dilutive mergers or acquisitions in any of its segments may result in lost market share and in more severe cases, a full exit from the segment.
* AWS competes mainly against Microsoft Azure, a cloud provider that has been growing faster than AWS and controls the overall cloud market due to its well-known business solutions and integrated IaaS-PaaS-SaaS platform. AWS‚Äôs lack of a complete suite of SaaS services, consumer industry reluctance of AWS adoption due to competition concerns, and Microsoft‚Äôs strong corporate relationships could result in Microsoft taking over AWS‚Äôs controlling position in the IaaS / PaaS market.
* Amazon‚Äôs sheer size raises constant antitrust scrutiny from governments around the world. The timing, severity, and outcome of these investigations are deeply uncertain and could result in Amazon being broken up into several smaller companies and depressed valuations if shareholders see fewer opportunities for growth in the future if this were to occur.
* Andy Jassy has taken over Jeff Bezos as CEO, presenting potential risks to the future of the company if the strategic course of the were to diverge dramatically from Bezos‚Äôs mission.
* Amazon is still in growth mode ‚Äì margin pressure will remain a risk in the short- and long-term.

Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter.

**Fundamentals**

As of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was \~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of \~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of \~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology.

Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc.

(source: [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/pedata.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html))

**Current Policies**

Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan.

I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.

We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html))

While the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain. (source: [https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel\_germany\_tsmc/#:\~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel_germany_tsmc/#:~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber).)

**Recent History**

In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&amp;D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months).

Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&amp;D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back.

Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/)). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers.

**Final Thoughts**

The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock.

Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: [https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:\~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30](https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30)) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance.

While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run.

Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries.

495,1658846608,w8ll0v,1,"Ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech earnings later this week, Ed Yardeni has some words of comfort: the worst has passed for this bear market.

In the view of the Yardeni Research president, the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs plunge last month to a 3,666.77 low likely marked the trough of the 2022 equity rout. Underpinning the sanguine call is the resilience in corporate earnings and the still-healthy outlook for consumers and businesses even as the economy slows.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never easy to pick a bottom in the stock market, but I‚Äôm going to give it a try,‚Äù Yardeni said on Bloomberg TV. ‚ÄúThe real question is going to be the earnings season, and so far the earnings season is going reasonably well. It has not really thrashed the stock market, and the stock market‚Äôs held up quite well.‚Äù

The statement is a large one ahead of a decisive week -- the Fed looks all set for another supersized interest-rate hike on Wednesday, while most mega-cap technology companies, including Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon, Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, will release their earnings reports.

Yardeni appears to be in the minority. In Bank of America Corp.‚Äôs survey this month, money managers said they‚Äôve cut their equity exposure to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, a sign of no faith in recent market bounce. At the end of June, a Deutsche Bank AG poll showed 72% of respondents expected the S&amp;P 500 to fall to 3,300 first, rather than rallying to 4,500.

But if Yardeni‚Äôs track record is any indication, it‚Äôs worth heeding the view of a market veteran who coined terms like ‚ÄúFed Model‚Äù and ‚Äúbond vigilante.‚Äù The strategist, who worked at Oak Associates Ltd. and Deutsche Bank before founding his namesake research firm, called the equity bottom the same month when the 1982 bear market ended. He then repeated the success in March 2009 when the S&amp;P 500 reached an intraday low of 666.79 -- 3,000 points below this year‚Äôs trough in what he calls another ‚Äúdevilish number.‚Äù

498,1658807808,w89hp2,1,"Amazon is increasing prices for its Prime membership scheme across its major European markets, several months after raising fees for US customers, in a move intended to offset the ecommerce giant‚Äôs operating costs.

In Germany, Amazon‚Äôs biggest market outside of the US, membership costs will increase 30 per cent, while Prime members in France will pay 43 per cent more for perks such as faster delivery and Amazon‚Äôs online entertainment. Increases will also be applied in Spain and Italy.

The increases are steeper than the 17 per cent jump in the Prime membership price that came into effect for new US subscribers in February.

For UK customers the price of an annual subscription will increase 20 per cent from ¬£79 to ¬£95 a year. The price will go from ¬£7.99 to ¬£8.99 per month for those paying in monthly instalments.

A spokesperson attributed the move to ‚Äúincreased inflation and operating costs‚Äù. The changes will go into effect on September 15.

An Amazon spokesperson noted it was the first time since 2014 the company had raised the cost of Prime in the UK. According to research group Insider Intelligence, the UK has at least 27mn Prime members. It estimated that penetration among the UK population surpassed 50 per cent in 2021. It projects 32.2mn Prime subscribers in the UK by 2024.

Amazon had not previously confirmed plans to implement Prime price rises outside of the US.

‚ÄúAmazon raising the price of Prime membership is unsurprising given recent inflation ‚Äî and that it already pulled this lever in the US six months ago,‚Äù said Andrew Lipsman from Insider Intelligence. ‚ÄúWhile the timing of this price hike will be met with more grumbles than it would‚Äôve been in February, consumers will ultimately shrug off the increase since Prime remains a great value.‚Äù

The price increase comes as the $1.2tn ecommerce and cloud giant faces soaring costs in its retail business ‚Äî a result of supply chain strains, overstaffing and an overexpansion of warehousing space during the coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, Amazon is spending big on acquiring content for Prime Video, its answer to Netflix. The company has splashed out on rights to broadcast Premier League and Champions League football, as well as the creation of a new Lord of The Rings TV series. Earlier this year Amazon closed its $8.45bn deal to take over film studio MGM.

Prime members are crucial to driving Amazon‚Äôs profit margins, as they typically spend more money on the site, and shop more often, than regular customers. But the principle attraction ‚Äî free delivery within one or two days ‚Äî has become increasingly expensive for the company to maintain as the price of fuel and other costs has rocketed.

After going through much of the peak pandemic period soaking up much of that pressure, the company has more recently started passing on some costs to sellers and customers. In addition to the Prime price rise in the US, in April it instituted a 5 per cent fuel surcharge on deliveries in that country.

Operating costs for Amazon‚Äôs international business ‚Äî excluding its AWS cloud division ‚Äî increased in the January-March period from $29.4bn to $30bn, with the segment swinging from a $1.3bn operating profit for the quarter in 2021 to a $1.3bn loss in 2022.

In the same period, global sales on Amazon‚Äôs online store fell from $52.9bn to $51.1bn.

Amazon is set to report earnings for the April-June period on Thursday. Its stock is down by more than 30 per cent since the start of the year, part of the broader sell off of Big Tech stocks.

On Monday, Amazon‚Äôs shares fell around 4 per cent in after-hours trading following a profit warning from Walmart, its primary retail competitor in the US. Walmart said inflation was hurting its shoppers and predicted adjusted earnings per share for the full year would decline as much as 13 per cent. Shares in other retailers, such as Target and Costco, also fell on the warning.

Employers over 6000 employees across the world. 80%, are african.  The company has been around for 10 years,  has over 100,000 sellers and 40 million products. 

Why?..
Africa geo politically neutral.  Investing around the world is become more politicized and investors have more risk than ever in Europe and Asia. In comes investment into Africa. 

Population. . 
 Africa is home to the fastest growing gdp percentage wise and the fastest growing population. Over a billion people and no demographic crisis to happen unlike China or other developed countries. Over 42% of children and young minds will be in Africa by 2030. 

Digital payments....
Jumia is building e payment system akin to PayPal that can be used outside jumia eco system and inside jumia.  This is important because more Africans have access to a mobile phone than a bank account. Africa will likely be a continent to revolutionize what a financial system can be by the end of this century.  Most payments in jumia are done through jumia pay. Jumia are some of the first interactions Africans have with e commerce just like ebay was for me and why I ever had a PayPal account which ended up having many uses outside of ebay for me.

Logistics....
Recent partnerships in 2022 like Ups ( American)  and 4px ( Chinese) and errand360( african) have all partnered with jumia for delivery and last mile logistics. Jumia is clearly a leader if some major companies use it  and jumia is not only creating a business in e commerce but also logistics by increasing drop off stations and mastering delivery in the fastest growing urban environments on our planet right now which are all in Africa . Also jumia connects small vendors to consumers as well with a combinations of logistics/ e commerce and doesn't just use jumia's own warehouses. 


And of course e commerce the bread and butter of jumia. Jumia is popular downloaded app in Africa . Top 25 in Egypt , 15 in Nigeria...etc. and jumia has been around for a decade.

**Microsoft, Earnings announcement Jul 26, 2022, after the market close:**

On Jul 8th Piper Sandler lowered Microsoft‚Äôs estimate due to foreign exchange headwinds from the persistently strong U.S. dollar.

It expects to report between $51.94 billion and $52.74 billion in revenues for the quarter. The company had previously forecast fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion.  
Microsoft also slightly cut its quarterly earnings forecast, saying it now expects to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $2.24 to $2.32. Previously, the company projected adjusted EPS between $2.28 and $2.35.

**Apple, Earnings announcement Jul 28, 2022, after the market close:**

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 12 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $1.13. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $1.3. Analysts expect Q3 revenue of $82.8 billion, up 1.7% YoY. Morgan Stanley said Apple could get back on track and hit $3 trillion on its services shift.

**Alphabet, Earnings announcement Jul 25, 2022, after the market close:**

Alphabet (GOOGL) missed top &amp; bottom line expectations in the last quarter due to a slowdown in the advertising market. Google expects to increase its revenues by 13.3% to $70.1 billion. EPS is expected to fall by 4.4% to $1.30.

 **Amazon, Earnings announcement Jul 28, 2022, after the market close:**

Amazon has been on a streak recently. The wrong kind of streak, though. Disappointing investors. Revenues are expected to grow 6% to reach $119.5 billion. EPS is expected to get crushed due to inflationary pressures. Of course, AWS will be on focus.

 **Facebook, Earnings announcement Jul 27, 2022, after the market close:**

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on ten analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.51. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $3.61. Revenue is also forecast to dip 0.2% to $29.0 billion due to weaker advertiser demand and lower ad prices on Facebook and Instagram.

Daily active users and monthly active users numbers will be in focus. Market participants will also pay attention to how much money Facebook is willing to spend on its reality labs segment.

**2. Macro Economic indicators**:

First, let‚Äôs start by saying that the macro picture is not looking good.

**A. PMI:**

Flash US PMI Composite Output Index registered 47.5 in July, down notably from 52.3 in June, to signal a solid contraction in private sector output. The rate of decline was the sharpest since the initial stages of the pandemic in May 2020, as both manufacturers and service providers reported subdued demand conditions.

**B. Philly Fed New Orders:**

Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is based on The Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in the Third Federal Reserve District. Participants report the direction of change in overall business activity and the various measures of activity at their plants: employment, working hours, new and unfilled orders, shipments, inventories, delivery times, prices paid, and prices received.

Philadelphia Fed said Thursday [its gauge of regional business activity](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/manufacturing-business-outlook-survey) dropped to negative 12.3 in July from negative 3.3 in the prior month.

Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal expected a 1.6 reading.

Any reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions in the manufacturing sector. This is the second straight month in contraction territory.

**C. Dr. Copper**:

Copper (The commodity) predicts turning points in global economic cycles. The reason for that is because Copper is used in almost every sector. Demand for Copper is a reliable leading indicator of economic health. How do you gauge the demand? By looking at the price of Copper. Rising Copper prices indicate that demand for the commodity is strong, hence, a growing global economy. A decline in prices suggests the opposite. Copper had fallen into a bear market in the run-up to each of the last four recessions dating back to 1990, as the chart below shows.¬†Copper fell into a bear market from its peak (-24%) in May 2021.

 **D. Inverted Yield Curve** 

The yield curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the San Francisco Fed. And yes, the yield curve is inverted. 

 **3. Federal Reserve Rate hikes, inflation, and expectations:**

Currently, it seems like the Fed will stick to a 75 bps rate hike in July. In June inflation print was 9.1%, hitting 40 year high. Expectations were that the Fed would become more aggressive and hike rates by 100 bps (1%). Hawkish Fed members are supporting a 75 bps hike and not 100 bps.

 **4. GDP Release:**

Gross Domestic Product will be released Thursday, July 28, 2022. Economists were expecting the U.S. economy to fall into recession somewhere in 2023. On July 1st, the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker showed that the U.S. economy might already be in a recession. The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs GDPNow gauge sees the second quarter at a negative 2.1%. Coupled with the first quarter‚Äôs decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession.",The most important week of 2022.,1.0,2022-07-24 05:29:12
503,1658634368,w6magj,1,"They used to have a big moat with streaming services--but with every other media company diving hard into streaming Netflix no longer has this advantage. Instead, it's now really a media company that sucks at making media, and unless they're going to be filing a chapter 11 within a few years 100%.

**The main problem:**

Netflix is obsessed with investing in absolute garbage shows--particularly live-action stuff. It's a shame because Netflix has two things that can make them into a media giant: \[1\] The willingness to throw lots of money at ideas and \[2\] a massively wide audience that's receptive to kids shows to adult shows.

**The solution:**

Stop paying for boring, over saturated, and boring shows/videogames. Then redirect that money into new content. 

For example: instead of throwing millions of aggregate dollars into comedy specials nobody gives a damn about, throw all of that money at Mr. Beast to make an exclusive Netflix show. Considering we're about to be in a recession, people will be extra willing to do dumb shit for money. The show will be a 10/10.

Another example: Instead of putting money into live-action remakes of shows nobody cares about, start buying the IP to popular fantasy novels and make shows from them. Branden Sanderson is probably the most famous fantasy author right now, but there are a lot of other guys who write dope books that could be converted into dope shows. And especially with the flop of Wheel of Time on Amazon, you bet people will be psyched to watch a dope fantasy series.

**Closing thoughts:**

Netflix, baby. Stop being dumb. Your platform does something no other platform does very well: it appeals to younger audiences and adult audiences. They have a huge catalog of shows for young people and a lot of stuff for adults and controls to allow households to control each. I mean, why do you think Disney bought Marvel and kept the name separate? Because they wanted an IP that appealed to adults and teens. Netflix has this advantage literally built into their business model but they aren't using it properly. 

Dude I'm just so mad at Netflix because they literally could be the biggest media company in the world if they weren't so goonish with respect to how they spend their money. It's insane.

The only thing blazingly fast about Netflix is how quickly they're going to need to file for bankruptcy within the next few years if they don't get it together.",Netflix is probably a $100 company if we're being real.,1.0,2022-07-24 03:46:08
504,1658602931,w6bgpz,1,"EA stated that they're ""actively"" looking to get acquired or merge with another company.   
Here's list of potential companies they are in talk with: Apple, Amazon, Disney and Comcast

**Apple**

Biggest acquisition made by Apple was $3. IMO I don't see Apple strategy or brand align with EA nor they would acquire it at such valuation. Apple already makes shitton of money for gaming thru its app store without making a single game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon**

Gaming isn't part of Amazon core business so it would none sense to spend +$40B on acquiring mediocre gaming company. Also the timing is bad as interest rate is rising. Finally Amazon already acquired 2 companies MGM and One medical last Friday. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Disney**

Honestly I don't have much thought about Disney but it seems they are currently in deep debt after Fox acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Comcast**

NBC Reportedly Offered to Merge With EA but didn't go through

&gt;During the last month of discussions, the proposal didn't go through due to disagreements surrounding the price of the merger and how it would be structured.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sony** already acquired a gaming company for $3.7B

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

EA currently valued around $37B with 47 PE. Which will make cash acquisition a bit difficult in such time (inflation, interest rate, recession risk ..) as most of companies is trying to save cash. 

Apple and Amazon probably won't acquire it giving the lack of synergies.

Beer in my hand on the beach, I should respond, but only because you are wrong in all senses. To begin, don't try to add technical-analysis-based merit to the fact that a series of crimes were discovered today regarding this very activity. Before I figuratively 'strike you with a broom', and ask you to get off my porch, I will respond:

It does looks like you put a lot of work into this post on a lonely Friday evening, which leads to me having a legitimate concern for how your quality of life is going. If you haven't noticed, it's a blast tossing money around, on legitimate bets, that 9 times out of 10 work out very nicely, that's why I am able to live the beautiful life that I do at such a dominant, in-my-prime age (when it matters most).

I'm feeling great from just one of my estates; completely self-made... with the ability to play Poker and Chess at a pro level, alongside Investments that you probably have never even heard of, on top of a highly successful job and career. So don't think for a second that fun dividend FD options investment has any value other than discovering key data prior to much more grandiose moves not just by me, but by an entire community of investors who are observing the data. And the data is collecting and collecting and collecting.

When you get to a highly educated and respected position in society, then you can afford to have fun tossing a few thousands of dollars around like it's nothing. But, in this case, consider me to be a sacrificial lamb and discovery of educational, academic, and perhaps even legal Information that is being provided in a very serious Department of Justice investigation, which remains ongoing, and with tentacles connecting to several other three letter agencies. So check yourself at the door before you think you know who or what you are even talking to when you try to add false merit, publicly, to cover up criminal activity that was discovered today on the books regarding $GME's dividend.

As my friends and colleagues will tell you, the only time I lose is if there's crime. That's why I am involved in this case.

Yet, your technical analysis couldn't be further from the truth. Check Tesla, Amazon, and the droves of other split stocks. There is an immediate democratization on the day-of. Tesla, you can see for yourself with the jump to 500. Sell-off usually occurs 2-5 days later. We are not talking about cash dividends here. We are talking about splits in the form of stock dividends. And there are only a few historical examples. But all of those examples had charts that did not look like what we saw today. However, that doesn't mean my bet was wrong. It means that crime prevented my bet from being in the money in the manner that it should have based on the order flow that you can clearly see on Fidelity's orders.

The data clearly shows that there was 90% buy volume. These orders were routed off exchange to the dark pool, and the sales were routed to the lit visual exchange. It's evidence that people who make valid trades like this, albeit this was at a very on the surface level.. people who make valid trades don't stand a chance on occasions like this against the desk at Citadel who makes the decisions on when to spoof, when to ladder down, when to let it ride, and in this case, why to reroute essentially the entirety of the buy orders to off exchange markets: because they don't have the shares. This was discovered across almost the majority of brokerages.

Yet, if you know how to play chess blindfolded, you would understand that my precise timing to do these moves, as I call micro bets, serves a purpose. Consider this small bet as a sacrificial lamb, yet the data that is extracted from this type of move serves a much more grandiose purpose that eventually will lead to traditional, corrupt Finance cracking apart. Splintering in many different pieces much further than traditional, corrupt Finance already has. It won't just be Andrew left, Gabe Plotkin, and Bill Hwang who are left out for the crows to eat. It'll be people that you thought you once trusted. People sitting in positions of authority, blocking swap transparency (CFTC). Blocking short transparency until the end of the year (DTCC). Spending taxpayer dollars to make anti-meme stock investing videos (SEC). Not to mention the US Treasurer who accepted (and may still accept) droves of millions of dollars from Citadel.

As I like to Surf the largest waves during the storm, I also like to invest during periods of the highest volatility. That is why I'm here today, and I'm not going anywhere. The next one is coming and it's going to be much much bigger. Just wait for the memes. Also wait for moass, given these now hundreds and hundreds of percent interest on borrow fees that shorts face. It really sucks to be them right now.

This FOMC will be even more juicy to buy overnight puts (may I recommend SPX 0dte here‚Ä¶) because despite 3 of the four last FOMCs opening red the next day‚Ä¶ granted only one of these was anything significant. Three of the last four FOMCs the following day has been red and the last two have both been -3%+ red days. This FOMC is special because the following day we get the q2 GDP reading‚Ä¶ why does this matter? Because this would be our SECOND negative reading in a row and that would mean we are 100% in a recession‚Ä¶ we should expect at minimum a -1 to -1.5% open Thursday morning. Now will markets dump or will they rip like after CPI? That part im not sure just yet on‚Ä¶ we also have Amazon, Ford, boeing, Ford, Meta and pinterest the day of FOMC‚Ä¶ this can be a hella big bearish catalyst especially if Google and MSFT have bad earning Monday/ Tuesday.

**How markets have played out at 2pm the last 4 FOMC meetings**

Now for January we didn‚Äôt have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets‚Ä¶ so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don‚Äôt really equate this January one to much since there was no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. (initial run up till 210, dropped under 220 and then peaked at 230, dropped at 235, retested 230pm high at 240 and then by 245pm was breaking the 230 lows‚Ä¶ from there we sold off until 250pm. Rested and then sold off the rest of the way at until 310pm when the bottom was in). 

March 16th FOMC we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. (235pm bottom is in but retested at 240pm).

May 4th FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji‚Ä¶ JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (bottom was put in at 235pm) 

June 15th FOMC We got the initial pop of green that was followed by a sell off. By 230pm when JPOW spoke we had found the bottom and from there we ran for 15minutes. This was the first FOMC though where at 245pm we saw a major pullback to where the 2pm candle opened before it then pushed green again to make a new HOD by 345pm. (bottom was put in at 235pm)

https://preview.redd.it/5lwrz3svf6d91.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d26625f758956e94ca08386bf913e06aadc6664d

&amp;#x200B;

**How I plan to trade FOMC**

How do we play this? Well assuming this is going to behave similar to the March, May and June FOMCs we are going to take the opening price at 2pm and look for a 1% drop. So lets saw we open at 390. That means are BUY target is 386.1. Now the trick with this is PATIENCE! We CAN NOT fomo in and we CAN NOT get nervous here. The timing HAS to be perfect here‚Ä¶ too early and youll get IV crushed (most likely will still get paid crazy good). The other thing that we have to be careful of is the wildcard market just dumps like January. The one thing I will say is that the January FOMC meeting was a wildcard and the market is much more understanding of FOMC than it was before in January. So I do think we will behave more like March, May and June especially. 

Okay so its now 235pm and we have our 1% drop at 386.1‚Ä¶ this is where its dealers choice you can either buy say a 3-5OTM CALL or you can just stick with the try and trued ATM call. We are expecting nearly a 2.8% on average pop here‚Ä¶ now of course that‚Äôs basically if you timed it perfectly top and bottom. For me I would safely set a 100% profit order if you entered anywhere remotely close to that 1% drop range and let it ride. You could set a 50% STOP LIMIT order once it gets closer to 100% and then just let it run till at least 245pm before closing it. 

The safest way though is to enter and immediately set a 100% take profit order. To be safe you could set a 50% sell order instead.  

The one thing to note here is that from 215 to 230pm there biggest IV crush happens along with the biggest fall usually and that is why you have to be careful. 

For those of you who wanna be aggressive AF‚Ä¶ another play here‚Ä¶ and mind you this one is the highest risk of them all‚Ä¶ would be to take 0.5% from the 2pm OPEN price so lets use 390 again‚Ä¶ 391.9 would be target‚Ä¶ once that level is hit enter an ATM put‚Ä¶. And then ride that down 1% from the 2pm candle OPEN. So that would be down to 386.1‚Ä¶ This method should net you a nice 50%. But this one is way riskier as you are exposed to IV crush and the way from the top to the bottom of 2pm to 215pm is wild and full of bounces and fake outs. This ones not for the faint of heart. 

**What if im wrong?**

Okay what is the wild card here? What if I am wrong? What do we look for‚Ä¶ im glad you asked! So with January the pattern was different. Now mind you January was a completely different time in the markets as they had ‚Äúno idea‚Äù what was to come and this was the first inflation shit the bed news, etc. etc. 

So with January we saw the spike at 2pm followed by a small sell off. The 215pm candle then just held within the 2pm candle which is key to watch for. We then saw that 230pm (when JPOW starts presser) was the peak and from there we basically started dumping. This will be key to watch for. If we aren‚Äôt seeing the Up -&gt; down -&gt; bigger up pattern started and come 230/235 we aren‚Äôt seeing the pattern making a bottom we need to be prepared to play a put instead. From 230 to 245 we dumped lower and then that 245 candle dumped us all the way until 245. Keep and eye on the candle bodies. If the candle bodies are looking weak and we aren‚Äôt seeing big wicks to the downside then we might get the dump like this. 

What could cause a dump like this? Well it depends what we see from the media this week and Monday/ Tuesday. The fed now is basically telling us we are getting 75bps hike and nothing matters. They said that 100bps hike wont help and doesn‚Äôt matter. We are essentially expecting a 75bps hike so if we get surprised with a 100bps hike AND JPOW throws some sort of wild card at us we might see a dump like this. 

The other wildcard which some are saying ‚Äúhow can you be so bearish for FOMC‚Ä¶ the markets already expects rates, etc. etc. etc.‚Äù To this I do agree and this is where I say despite things being priced in‚Ä¶ they are only priced in until the markets/ algos hear and see those numbers live. They its officially priced in. 

Someone else and other I am hearing mention that the fed may actually hint to a pausing of rate hikes from here on out and maybe even at Wednesday meeting‚Ä¶ why? Because big tech is already doing hiring freezes and the big techs are already showing that stuff is easing‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt 100% make sense to me but I do see some peoples logic with it. 

So if we are under the impression we are priced in then we need to be prepared that at 2pm till EOD we just rip on FOMC giving us ‚Äúgood‚Äù news‚Ä¶ aka not badder than expected news‚Ä¶

For this type of ‚Äúgood news FOMC‚Äù we gotta go back to December 15th and November 3rd 2021. 

If we are expecting bull run during FOMC we will look for a large 2pm to 230pm pop‚Ä¶ large then the normal 0.5% fake pop‚Ä¶ but the KEY would be that we see a small retracement leading to 230 presser starting but we do NOT break below the 2pm candles low. If this is what we are getting that magical 235pm time is still the best buy time. 

It is key to watch how the candles move and interact with eachother‚Ä¶ and either way you HAVE to be patient‚Ä¶ 235pm regardless seems to be the magical buy time‚Ä¶ and almost all scenarios 235pm is the CALL buy opportunity‚Ä¶ only 1 meeting in the last 8 meetings was it an actual put buying opportunity.",The only FOMC week TA/ DD you'll ever need to read,1.0,2022-07-22 20:10:59

That's the good word of Amazon bull Brent Thill, who honed in on a potential strong dislocation in the valuation of Amazon's massive retail operations.

""Our sum-of-the-parts analysis implies the current stock price is ascribing virtually zero value to Core-Retail, which is meaningfully below our base case estimate of $287 billion and results in a $29/ share free option at Amazon's current price,"" the Jefferies analyst said in a new note to clients. ""This suggests the stock is already pricing-in meaningful headwinds from a recession/cost inflation, limiting downside and creating an attractive risk-reward. Amazon appears to feel similarly, having initiated a $10 billion buyback program, with $2.7 billion in Q1 repurchases marking the company's first in over 10 years.""

People love to talk about the **""tight job market""** and how unemployment rates are still incredibly low. Don't expect that to last. It won't. As JPOW continues to hike up interest rates, the death spiral will start. More and more companies will have mass layoffs. Unemployment rate will go up higher than most people will expect. People who can't even imagine losing their jobs will lose their jobs. Just like these 8000 salaried Ford employees didn't expect to lose their jobs but they did anyway.

What does this mean for regular everyday Americans. Well, apart from the fact that finding a job will become harder than it is now, the housing market may collapse as well. If millions of Americans are laid off, then you can't expect them to continue making their monthly mortgage payments. Foreclosures will rise sharply.

518,1658374782,w46aow,1," So what kind of coked out adderall overdose made me go bold with this prediction of imminent doom when the market has been doing uppies all week? It's pretty simple. Next Wednesday is FOMC where we're either going to get a .75bp rate hike, in which case the market does its usual rocket ship after the meeting, or we get a surprise 1.00bp hike and things probably tank after the meeting. Then on Thursday we have the Q2 GDP numbers come out confirming we're officially in a recession. (a fact I called last October btw, it just took a couple months for the data to catch up) The real action though is in the Thursday after hours Earnings Reports. Specifically, the ERs for two of the biggest companies on the planet, both of which I expect to fail spectacularly.

Apple and Amazon.

Just in general I think both of these stocks are wildly overvalued (I have a fair price target of $20-25 on AMZN and $50 on AAPL) Amazon has a PE of 60, which is so absurd on multiple levels that I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's dumb. Apple has a PE of 25, which, again, is too high.

I think both companies are going to get absolutely annihilated on ER, and when they do, they'll drag the entire market down with them. Now, why I am I so sure both companies will have bad ERs?

For Amazon, it's really easy, their current post Bezos leadership is actually a bunch of ferrets piled on top of each other in trenchcoats, they wildly overexpanded during the pandemic, and as people go outside again, they're not loading up on orders. Also, Prime Day was a bust, and AWS continues to no longer enjoy exclusive rights to the cloud services space as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and more expand into it.

Current Amazon C-Suite

For Apple, they're basically in the same situation as Amazon was last ER, where they had a complete dumpster fire of an ER previously, but papered over it with nonsense - in Apple's case that was refusing to provide guidance for their #1 market and home of 100% of their assemblies - China.

So, to recap, on 7/27, you're going to have a FED rate hike, then on 7/28 you're going to see headlines screaming about how we're officially in recession all day, then that night you'll see two of the biggest pillars of the market report dumpster fire earnings.

Ironically this was the biggest single day drop across all the indices so far that year, despite 12 weeks of higher highs.

525,1658174358,w28mvm,1,"I recently remembered why I don‚Äôt go to Wal-Mart. I went there a couple weeks ago for the first time in about two years with my girlfriend. We were looking for some 4th of July sparklers. There wasn‚Äôt a single pack left on the shelves, of course. We both had to use the bathroom before we left. We had just purchased a bag of marshmallows, so I told my girlfriend to use the bathroom first while I stood outside with the marshmallows until she got out, and then we‚Äôd switch. As I‚Äôm waiting for her to get out of the women‚Äôs bathroom I‚Äôm people watching the customer service line. First person in line was unsuccessfully trying to return gun ammo. Next in line appeared to be a centenarian who kept nodding out, very much looking like she could die at any moment. Third was a fidgety crackhead who appeared to be bleeding through his shirt. Last was a 300+ lb woman wearing Cheetah print leggings, leaning over her cart and mumbling under her breath to the crackhead, ‚ÄúMoov up. Moov up. You gotta move tha fuck up.‚Äù She had nothing in her cart but four gallons of milk, sparklers, and, you guessed it, gun ammo.

My internal alert level had gone from green to yellow upon entering Wal-Mart and after witnessing the customer service line I was at a solid orange. Next, a guy walks out of the men‚Äôs bathroom and calls over a Wal-Mart manager. He says to the manager, ‚ÄúI know this is Wal-Mart, but there is a huge pile of shit on the floor in the bathroom and it‚Äôs just getting everywhere.‚Äù The Wal-Mart manager nods confidently as if to say he‚Äôs not alarmed and knows the drill. The man who notified the manager oddly doesn‚Äôt leave. Instead he stands two feet from me as I stare ahead and clutch my bag of marshmallows as I plummet deeper into the Twilight Zone that is my local Wal-Mart. My internal alert level is now at a deep red. Finally, the Wal-Mart manager reappears from the bathroom 30 seconds later. He addresses both the informant and myself, ‚ÄúYep, there‚Äôs feces all over the place. We‚Äôre gonna have to shut her down.‚Äù

My girlfriend finally walks out of the woman‚Äôs bathroom and says, ‚ÄúWow, I‚Äôm surprised how clean it was in there! Do you need to go still?‚Äù I just said, ‚ÄúNo, I just‚Ä¶ I just want to go home.‚Äù She goes, ‚ÄúI thought you really had to go.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to piss myself instead please let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

I went into Wal-Mart trying to celebrate my beloved America with a little 4th of July marshmallow and sparkler action. But in typical American fashion, I quickly found myself in a war zone. I don‚Äôt recommend anyone go into a Wal-Mart if possible. Particularly not when you‚Äôre sober. 

$GOEV is trying to fix Wal-Mart‚Äôs dilemma. Wal-Mart just purchased 4,500 Canoo EVs to deliver its Chinese goods door-to-door to its customers. Yes, clearly these electric fuck buses are the answer to competing with Amazon. Unrelated, but I have a theory Raiders‚Äô owner Mark Davis is secretly making strategic business decisions for Wal-Mart. 

Canoo and even Wal-Mart know that, not all, but many of its shoppers don‚Äôt want to wade through feces when buying their marshmallows and gun ammo. $GOEV is on the brink of bankruptcy and Wal-Mart has just thrown them a shit-covered life saver. Even the US Army just caught news of Wal-Mart‚Äôs interest, and General McConville himself wants to get in on the Canoo bang van action (these EVs literally look like they‚Äôve been designed to be an eco-friendly bang bus). 

I am down significantly on the year so I‚Äôm going to buy some $GOEV calls because why not. $GOEV has run 70% during the last week so it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to chase. This company looks like it should be out of business sometime tomorrow. But every option play I think makes sense almost never works. Time to start inversing myself.

With the assistance of ARMER back in May we got bored and decided to map out what the 2022 market crash COULD look like IF we followed the 2008 crash... and yes before everyone says it... i know this crash is different.. every crash is different... but all we have is historical data to go off of and trajectory wise we are the closest to 2008 then any others in my opinion...   


Anyways lets go down hypothetical lane... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/96ufqz2088c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801eb182455a55f55aeb2478d085466e516f26b6

And here is the 2008 weekly chart... (i adjusted zoom slightly)   
Looking at these charts... it could be inferred that we are at the last rising hump in August/ September before the massive dropped started...   


Okay lets look at some numbers...   


2022 crash prediction based on 2008 percent's- 385 --&gt; 431 (11.9% rise) --&gt; 367 (15% drop) --&gt; 392 (7% rise) --&gt; 255 (53% drop) --&gt; 301 --&gt; 229 --&gt; 301 --&gt; 217

Actual- 381 --&gt; 417 (9.5% actual rise) --&gt; 362 (13% actual drop) --&gt; 393 (8% rise) --&gt; expected 53% drop= $189

we hit 393 on June 28th. We should be right around the top again then based off these numbers... 

&amp;#x200B;

Now according to the 2008 crash... we actually are at max level before ""the big one"" IF we actually follow the 2008 crash model... we should be at our last bear market rally and should see the capitulation any time now.... 

now adjusting for the overall difference in % expected vs actual we would see something closer to 40-45% drop from 393 which puts us at around... 216-235. 

&amp;#x200B;

using previous lows from previous crashes/ corrections... the blue dotted line utilizes the 2008 crashes low and the 2020 covid crashes low to give us a predicted bottom of 255 to 280 if we were to continue the current bear market trajectory... of course a true capitulation would accelerate this and we could see that number... 

&amp;#x200B;

red dotted line uses the 2008 crashes low and the february 2016 bottom to give us a trajectory of 295 to 315 on current trajectory.

lastly we have the orange dotted line which utulizes the two lowest points POST covid crash (Sept 2020 and October 2020) to give us a trajectory of 360 to 370 as bottom...

now the crazy thing about this 360 to 380 and using this covid 2020 recovery trend is that we already saw a bounce off that orange dotted line ( a near perfect bounce) June 2022 AND the weekly 200ema is now perfectly on top of this orange dotted line... 

&amp;#x200B;

what if we did know the bottom or at least knew how to predict it? 

&amp;#x200B;

it seems if we blast through 365 again we could see that 295-315

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest issue with this all is the scaling of it... the 2008 crash was much slower. 2022 took 6 months to crash 25% while 2008 took 9 months to crash 25% initially. that means this crash is happening about  50% faster than 2008... so we need to bear that in mind. For reference the 2020 crash one month to crash 25% or about 9 times faster....   


so bearing that in mind when comparing charts and time frames... there is still a case to be had that the crash IS coming... the question is when and will we actually know? 

&amp;#x200B;

so what if we did know the bottom or at least knew how to predict it? 

&amp;#x200B;

it seems if we blast through 365 again we could see that 295-315  


  
In my opinion after i had 1000% expected to see a crash/ capitulation start Wednesday when that dogwater CPI came in... my best worst case scenario comes next week.   


Tesla reports wednesday night after bell... in my opinion not a big factor. It may hit or miss... i dont think markets care enough and it in and of itself can not take the markets down.   


The week of July 25th is one hell of a doozy...   

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel  


This right here is the ONLY perfect shit storm i can even remotely suspect to take the markets to the bottom... IF MSFT, GOOG, amazon all miss AND FOMC ""surprises"" (lol) us with a 100bps hike AND then GDP comes in thursday morning negative 1000% confirming we are in a recession and then APPLE tanks after bell thursday... The week of July 25th could be one of the biggest drops we have seen yet....

so how should we play this? Despite what the numbers are calling for... i am looking for SPY this week to break out to that 400 to 415 level... on the weekly chart 415 perfectly rejects the black channels resistance line AND perfectly rejects the sideways purple channel... 

IF we get the big bull run this week AND end up somewhere near 410-415 by EOW.... AND the vix unwinds down near 18-20... i think friday before market close is our chance to load up on 30-60DTE VIX calls and SPY puts...   


and then IF by some miracle the markets still rally after the week of July 25th...  then i believe the bottom IS in... i think that orange dotted line i showed you above IS the bottom.... And i will need HEAVILY convinced otherwise....",Hear me out... what if we knew where the bottom of the 2022 Stock Market crash could be? Is this the bottom ?,1.0,2022-07-18 01:29:45

The once thought to be vaporware electric vehicle company, Canoo ($GOEV), is now poised to be the most American electric vehicle company of all time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm keeping this short and anything I mention can easily be looked up. I can't be fucked to post any links because WSB auto mod sucks my red, white, and blue cock. 

&amp;#x200B;

If somehow you live under a rock and aren't aware, **Walmart** signed a deal to buy 4,500 vehicles from Canoo with the ability to either A. buy an additional 10,000 or B. up to 10,000 vehicles. They also barred Canoo from doing any business with Amazon (Amazon &amp; Rivian vs. Walmart &amp; Canoo, anyone?). Walmart was also granted warrants to redeem up to \~61 million shares of Canoo, coming out to about 20% ownership of the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

Canoo was also chosen by the **UNITED STATES ARMY** to provide a vehicle for ""analysis and demonstration."" 

&amp;#x200B;

and of course the deal Canoo has with **NASA** to provide the vehicle(s) that will shuttle astronauts onto the launchpad for the upcoming Artemis launch to the moon.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention the emphasis Canoo has on hiring Native Americans &amp; Veterans and attempting to source 100% of its' materials from America. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although the main bear thesis for Canoo is if they can even get to production with their lack of known funding and cash, a bet against Canoo is a bet against Walmart, NASA, the US Army, and America. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR -  It's about being a fucking American, a state of mind. You don't need to be born in America to be an American. You just need to get up in the morning and grab your balls, and look at the flag and look at Canoo and say, ""You know what, I got this cocksuckers, I don't need no dumpster behind wendy's.""**",$GOEV Canoo poised to be the all-American EV Company,1.0,2022-07-15 00:49:14

Introduction:

Hello fellow degenerates, I am back after a brief hiatus. I got way too caught up in work, holiday shenanigans, and lots of other BS. However, I am finally back on my horse and I am ready to bring some more smooth-brained DD to you all. I have been on a bit of a cold streak lately with my positions but I‚Äôve got a feeling this is the Aaron Judge 450 foot homer I have been seeking. What I will be doing with this post is simply a general DD on the current state of the market. I am going to present topics and attempt to give as objective a take as one man can. Full disclosure however in that before even diving into any research, I myself am very bearish on the markets in the short term. What I will be taking a position in come market open tomorrow is the SPY ETF. For those of you who have consumed more crayons than myself, the SPY ETF refers to the S&amp;P 500 index and is weighted accordingly to the index fund itself. It is heaviest in technology stocks (24.66%) however it is very diverse also holding healthcare (15.08%), financial services (12.86%), consumer cyclical (10.66%), communication services (9.1%), industrials (8.14%), consumer defensive (7.28%), energy (4.18%), utilities (2.99%), real estate (2.86%), and basic materials (2.19%). Additionally, the top 10 individual holdings within SPY are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Nvidia. In total they make up 27.72% of SPY‚Äôs total assets. All that being said, let‚Äôs dive into this irrational cesspool that we currently call a market.

Consumer Price Index (June YoY &amp; MoM) \- Wednesday

The consumer price index is expected to come in at an annual rate of 8.8% year over year with month over month expected to come in at 0.6%. As everyone knows, inflation has been running rampant and crushing economists' expectations lately leading to the current falls in general markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

Well, if the CPI comes in at or under economists expectations I believe a massive market rally will ensue on the news that will unfortunately cause some damage to the puts that I plan on partaking in. The reason the market will rally is simply because that would show inflation has possibly peaked and therefore Jerome Powell and our central bank may consider not being as hawkish and utilizing a less aggressive rate hike at their next meeting in a few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

If the CPI comes in above already lofty expectations, I expect the market to take another dive back to previous lows set in June, quite possibly surpassing them in the coming weeks. This would be because in addition to the surprise in total nonfarm payrolls smashing expectations, this would show that the U.S. economy is still running hot currently and the 75 basis point rate hike discussed at the most recent FOMC Minutes would be more than justified. In an unbelievably red hot inflation scenario, word could spread of a possible full percent (100 bps) hike which would undoubtedly obliterate the SPY and cause puts to more than print. My evidence for this statement is to look at what the market did in June after ONE 75 basis point hike and high CPI data. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Retail Sales (MoM) - Friday 

Retail sales are expected to come in at 0.9% for the month of June. Previously, Retail sales came in at -0.3% which should in theory signal a possible coming recession due to the slower consumption of retail goods by Americans. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

If Retail Sales come in below expectations or especially if they come in negative this time yet again, this also will signal an incoming recession and again could trigger the Fed to lighten up on the rate hikes which could cause a bullish bounce of sorts or even a market rebound as investors come to expect the easy money to return to the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

If retail sales come in above expectations this will signal consumers still have money in which they are willing to spend on retail goods which will incline the Fed to be more hawkish, which again would cause the markets to dump. Should we get a high CPI in conjunction with high retail sales, a 75 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting has a much higher probability of occurring. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Michigan Consumer Sentiment

First, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment is a monthly survey of how consumers feel about the economy, personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. The University of Michigan conducts at least 500 phone calls and covers personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions over 50 questions with US consumers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

Ironically, if US consumer sentiment drops to new all time lows this will be bullish for the market as again it will try to lean the Fed into a more dovish position and perhaps only hike rates 50 bps instead of the discussed 75 bps. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

Consumer sentiment rallies, defying expectations and shows optimism among American consumers. Again, if this and the CPI both follow the bearish take or all 3 I personally believe that this will be too much for markets and puts on the SPY will be in for some tendies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My Personal Opinion

Much of this is crystal ball guesswork my friends. I cannot tell you what will occur and if I could I wouldn‚Äôt still be giving dandy handies behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster. However, I do believe that CPI will come in higher than expected. This is due to past CPI coming in hotter than expected and most importantly this data is for the month of June. Energy prices, especially oil went berserk for the entirety of June which should carry CPI above expectations alone. Not only that but literally anything I have bought has continued to go up in price on a literal monthly basis. While my Hoosier ass is by no means a proxy for the entirety of inflation and the economy it is still telling. 

Additionally, I believe that one of the two following economic indicators (retail sales or consumer sentiment) will also follow a path that makes the Fed have to raise interest rates by at least 75 bps at their meeting in a few weeks. It is this interest rate raise that I believe will crush markets at least in the very near future. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Exit Plan:

By all means get greedy if you guys would like but I figured I would post my own thoughts for how I plan to proceed. I am going to buy 3 SPY $380 8/19 Puts at market open tomorrow morning. This is to get ahead of the economic indicators occurring this week and quite possibly make a nice 25% on my investment before the market even closes Friday. Personally I believe these contracts could do so by then and I would be happy with a \~$750 gain in a few days on a \~$3,000 investment. 

If I am wrong though and these contracts lose value as the market decides to rally, I will be doubling down on my position, putting all of my capital in and scooping up as many contracts as I can. I will more than likely do so on Friday after Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment data to hopefully get the best price per contract. 

In a worst case scenario, I will sell at a loss, selling all of my contracts on August 1st before Theta begins to obliterate my sweet cheeks more than it already will have by that point. This would be done to save some capital and have a chance at recouping my losses. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 

Higher than forecasted inflation + Higher than forecasted Consumer sentiment + Higher than forecasted Retail Sales = JPow hiking rates and sending us full speed ahead into a recession, crushing equities and therefore making lots of money for bears. If you do not comprehend the above sentence, here is a one month SPY chart, I‚Äôm buying $380 strike puts, I‚Äôm not asking for the apocalypse, just a nice short term dip, who cares what happens after.

Here my friends is the Daily Chart of the VIX for all of 2022. What do you see?

Green channel- this is where we spend a lot of the beginning of the January and February and briefly spent time in April. This range is 18.7 to 25.5.

Orange channel- this is where we peak in Feb and March and spent almost all of May, June and July until last week. This ranges from 25.5 to 34.7

You also see we just broke major ‚Äúsupport‚Äù on the black dotted line last Thursday on the VIX. You also see we have been making lower highs on the VIX since January 24th we have not made a new peak. And we also haven‚Äôt made a recent higher high since May 2nd. 

Time wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX &gt;25.5.

Okay still with me here?

IF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX ‚Äúbottom‚Äù tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn‚Äôt have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. 

This means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. 

Current positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn‚Äôt properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th.

What does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the ‚Äúbig one‚Äù and see ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn‚Äôt quite seal the deal. 

If my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. 

The one question that we don‚Äôt know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. 

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel

The week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven‚Äôt already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. 

What if im wrong? Whats the worst case scenario and time to cut bait on VIX/ UVXY calls?

IF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don‚Äôt see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. 

All I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC‚Ä¶ Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July.

Many generalize growth companies as follows: ¬†

* Categorize growth companies as 1 category (i.e. so long as revenue is growing; they are growth companies)
* Perceive all growth companies as risky, especially in a down cycle 
* Revenue growth will be affected by the economic downcycle. ¬†¬†

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

My favourite quote: 

***Bad companies are destroyed by crisis, Good companies survive them, Great companies are improved by them‚Äù - Andy Grove.***

&amp;#x200B;

The table below shows a simple categorization using revenue growth, the ability to generate free cash flow, and profitability.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mmjqao1nlfa91.jpg?width=1128&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ae06c7137880507827905ef0517d7c9c3c8f7fb

 

I broadly categorized growth companies into 4 types:¬†

1. Early-stage: The companies are just established with revenue started to generate and growing very fast due to their small base; huge losses relative to revenue.¬†
2. Hypergrowth: Their revenue growth is very fast with huge losses.¬†
3. High growth: Some are growing revenue with good free cash flow while others are not. 
4. Stable growth: These are growing their revenue steadily with good FCF and profits.¬†

It is up to investors to identify and select the type of growth companies to invest in based on their preference and risk appetite.¬†

*For now, I am into high growth and stable growth; evaluating and waiting for opportunities to go into early-stage / hyper-growth.* ¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Are they affected by the down cycle/recession?¬†

* There are sectors and companies that thrive well in economic downcycle. ¬†
* In an economic downcycle, uncompetitive, unproductive companies with high debts and low FCF are more easily affected than high-quality companies.¬†
* We need to validate these growth companies with each financial result released to evaluate if their revenue growth, FCF and profitability as well as its competitiveness are still maintained well.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

**Why growth companies?**¬†

To me, they represent the more competitive and safer companies that will thrive well in a down cycle.¬†

In a down cycle, there will be companies and sectors offering cheaper and better services that people need. 

***Bad companies are destroyed by crisis, Good companies survive them, Great companies are improved by them‚Äù - Andy Grove.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Separating business and financial performances with share price performance**

Also, in a down cycle, as we are witnessing down, there are many growth companies being sold down a lot more. This gives the opportunity to pick up the bargains and the gems. 

Yes, time is required to study each company in detail to determine their quality; to find the next Amazon and Microsoft etc.¬†I felt that the efforts are worthy and be awarded in the longer term. 

***A crisis is an opportunity not to be wasted.***

**Summary:**  The market currently believes that there are heavy recessionary  pressures hitting right now and that these will come to a boiling point  in Q4 2022, forcing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. I do not  believe that this is going to happen.

**Body:**  The way I see it, the market has been trained like a Pavlovian dog to  expect that when ever there are problems with the economy, the Federal  Reserve comes in and bails everyone out with their Fed put: QE, rate  cuts, the whole shebang. This time, Pavlov's dog is hearing the  deafening bell and really wanting some food, but it will not get it. See  the figure 1 below. The market believes economic pressures are expected  to become too much to handle around the end of Q4 2022, inflation will  have fallen, and then we can cut rates and go back to the liquidity  extravaganza we have all loved to buy calls upon.

https://preview.redd.it/xkhot80djg991.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89a7edaabad5db7eb3b551571d7a51053c4c2f35

The  problem, however, is that this does not align with what the Federal Reserve officials themselves think. The first and most glaring case that I  think the market is ignoring is from Governors Neel Kashkari and  Christopher Waller. When even Kashkari has turned hawkish, you know  there is a problem.

Take a listen  to this video. This is from May 10, 2022, not long ago. Of all the  parts, most shockingly, it only has 658 views the time I have posted  this. With only 658 people that have listened to everything that has  been said, I think the market is missing out on some extremely important  information.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQgMe-Ec-C8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQgMe-Ec-C8)

https://preview.redd.it/j5awjgvejg991.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1e7149c5c920287b87dbd3d58691284d050b672

The  most important part, even though I believe the entire thing is  important, starts at 16:55. The two are discussing economic history and  how they think it is influencing the present.

Waller:  ""To get inflation down... in a soft landing... people say you can't do  it, you've got to cause a recession and tank the economy, because  they're thinking back to Paul Volcker in ... 1980... He jacked up  interest rates to 20%, tanked the economy... and now the entire world  thinks that's what you have to do to bring down inflation.""

He then goes on to say, ""I'm going to say that's not the case.""

And  I definitely start to agree with him here - you do not need 20%  interest rates. The Volcker Moment was the destination of a 10+ year  mistake-ridden journey from Arthur F. Burns before Volcker.

From  Waller Again - 17:28: ""Volcker had to deal with a world in which inflation was out of control from almost a decade. The Fed had zero  credibility in its promises to do anything about it's promises to do  anything about inflation, because every time they did..."" and this is  the best part of all ""**unemployment  would tick up, but they would immediately abandon the inflation (fight)  (rate hikes) and went after the unemployment.**"" ""That's not the case (now), we barely had inflation for about a year of any significant magnitude, **and there is no backing off.**""

18:40: ""...We know the damage that happens if you don't do it. **That's the lesson we learned** from the 80's. We know what happens from the Fed not taking their job seriously on inflation.""

Neel Kashkari: ""Well said."" Audience laughter....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So,  Waller said that they learned their lessons from the 1970's &amp;  1980's. What wrong action led them to this lesson? The Lesson was acting  like Arthur F. Burns. What did Arthur Burns do repeatedly that was so  bad that eventually led to the Volcker Moment? Well, take a look at  1970/01/01 and 1974/09/01 on the figure 2.) graph below. Each time  inflation started to go down, the discount rate - Fed used discount rate  in the 1970's, not Fed Funds like today - followed inflation lower to  the point where the discount rate never got substantially above the  inflation rate until the 1980's, where the discount remained  substantially above the inflation rate for some time.

https://preview.redd.it/hgz1hachjg991.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0af62d141a2fd828662bdd0ce013e27340843e5f

1980  was the key, the economy entered a recession inflation started to fall -  house prices, energy, food, materials - but the discount rate did not  fall to being modestly above the CPI y/y rate, the discount rate stayed  substantially above the inflation rate for some time - notably in 1983,  which put the death nail in the inflation increase with 6.50% real  rates. Other wise, there likely would have been another inflation leg  higher into 1985.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In figure 3.), this is the CPI y/y vs. the Fed Funds rate.

https://preview.redd.it/0kst6nojjg991.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34a58a28cb9ab25b7068dd49a61c84faae5b7aa0

&amp;#x200B;

In  figure 4.), this is the real 5 year U.S. rates, using UMich consumer  inflation expectations over the next 5 years minus the current 5-year  U.S. Treasury rate. I used UMich consumer inflation expectations and not  investors inflation expectations from breakevens because I believe the  consumer expectations are more accurate - less disconnected - and more  relevant and responsive to actual price changes.

Combining  figures 3 &amp; 4, we see that the Federal Reserve forward guidance is  working, kind of. The 5 year real rates are still negative, and based  from what we saw from the 1980's where you need not just positive real  rates, but substantially positive real interest rates -- 1980's had  6.50% real rates to finally vanquish inflation -- vs. the negative 0.10%  of today is extremely stimulative.

The  most important point here is that at the recessionary bottom in 1972,  the real rates were +2% and this was not enough to stop inflation over  the next decade, **the real rates need to be higher.**

Disregard  for a minute that we have been in a recession since January and  inflation has still increased 7% annualized since the start of our  current recession, invalidating the bull parroting that ""a recession  will cure inflation!"" It clearly has not. However, a severe recession  might.

And this is where my thesis  comes in. The inflation rate is expected to fall when we enter the  deeper throws of the recession. If inflation falls to 3% over the next  year - extremely optimistic I think - the real rates will still only be  +.50% if the Fed gets to a 3.50% Fed Funds, and this is with the fed not  cutting rates that everybody thinks they will! The 1980's showed me  that we need much higher real rates than 2%, maybe near 6%, once  inflation's momentum has increased substantially like it has now and  like it did in the 1980's, +.50% just did not cut it back then and will  not cut it now. To get substantially positive real rates, we either have  to have *sustained* deflation of  about -2% (3.50% fed funds - -2% deflation == +5.50% real rates) or  interest rates about 6% with 2% inflation (6% fed funds - 2% inflation  == 4% real rates.)

In other words,  the Fed Put is dead. Nothing that I think will happen can allow the  Federal Reserve to cut interest rates without repeating the mistakes of  1970's and starting a next cycle higher in the inflation rate -- which  Waller unequivocally stated they will not allow to happen, because of  how devastating it will be.

Therefore,  the only way I see out of this is that when inflation troughs lower,  the federal funds rate stays elevated -- no cuts in the Federal Funds  rates, and deflation. When the Federal funds rate is not cut going into  this inflation trough, the economy is going to severely contract,  leading to deflation, like in 2008 when the housing bubble burst. When  there is deflation with an un-cut Fed Funds rate at 3.50%, and sustained  deflation of about -1.50%, then we will have substantially positive  real rates of 5%. This allows the least worst outcome in my mind. The  Fed does not have to raise interest rates substantially positive so that  the Federal Government does not have to pay substantially higher  interest on their debt, and they stamp out the inflation problem. If the  Federal Funds rate is cut going into this inflation trough, then they  are facing the inflationary momentum of the next legs up like what  happened in the 1970's.

&amp;#x200B;

More  evidence that makes me think central bankers see the zugzwang we are in  and are going with the not cutting rates and deflation move is from the  Financial Times. (no paywall, surprisingly)

And finally, from J. Powell's numerous speeches, but from the Guardian here - [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/18/the-federal-reserve-says-its-remedies-for-inflation-will-cause-pain-but-to-whom](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/18/the-federal-reserve-says-its-remedies-for-inflation-will-cause-pain-but-to-whom)

""Powell  recently made it clear that the Federal Reserve's remedies to combat  runaway inflation, ""will cause some pain."" Will here is a future tense,  meaning it has not happened yet.

This  echos Waller from earlier -- ""unemployment would tick up, but they  would immediately abandon the inflation (fight) (rate hikes) and went  after the unemployment."" They are expecting unemployment to tick up --  that is the real pain -- and they are saying it has to happen and we  have to go through with it, meaning we can not try to ease it, with rate  hikes.

If this thesis starts to play out this could get bad as this is what home prices vs. income looks like right now in figure 5. As Michael Burry once said, if it's not income that increasing home prices, its leverage.

Positions:

**Long** ***Strong*** **Corporate Bonds &amp; U.S. Treasuries:**  I have not bought any of these, and will not, but I think they will be a  good store of value/ slight wealth appreciation to ride out the damage.  I think you can make some money with these with low risk, but I want to  make a lot more money since I have some to risk now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting commodities:** High real rates and recessions have always been bad for commodities, deflation is worse. I picked shorting natural gas here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting Companies that Rely on Low Interest Rates**:  For this one I have picked going short on Amazon. I think that the  consumer is very weak right now, and if we get the deflation they will  get weaker. In addition it is by its nature a luxury good, people  increase spending at it in good times and switch to normal goods in bad  times, going to Dollar General, Walmart and the like. Amazon is also a  classic growth stock with a 51 PE at the time of writing this, not good  for what I think will happen.

Risk Factors:

As  stated previously, the market clearly does not agree with this idea,  they think that rate cuts are on the way and the Federal Funds rate will  not stay elevated, at a minimum. Even the biggest bears in the market  do not agree with this idea - exemplified by Michael J. ""Big Short,  Bigger Realist"" Burry below. If I disagree with this autistic genius,  then I am probably 99% chance going to be wrong, but I am holding on to  that 1% tightly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1: The lore of the electric K√§fer**

Spool back to the start of 2018.A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the ‚Äú(not so) secret master plan‚Äù of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot harder and more complex than initially thought. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c

You know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‚Äòll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting ‚ÄúHumans are underrated‚Äù. Heartwarming.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it. 

Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vapourware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5

When things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, this bombshell hit the wire: 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it. 

Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3

The deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts**

We have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, we are now going to war. 

As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful ‚Äúluxury‚Äù car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver ssist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. They combine everything MBA‚Äôs are afraid of. 

* Insanely capital intensive 
* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008) 
* Humongous unionised workforces 
* Stiff competition 
* Razor thin margins 
* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation) 
* Supply chains longer than the river nile  

You get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years. 

No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are damn impossible. 

As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need. 

Famously, Railroads are really ‚ÄúTransportation‚Äù companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers. 

That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don‚Äôt need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA‚Äôs darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP. 

What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business?

If you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. FSD was going to work next year and don‚Äôt bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins. 

Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.

Add a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a 99.999% stock based compensation plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. **EVER**.

Enter 2020. After a short rally into february, a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of normandy, this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: Liftoff**

Now with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard. 

**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee. 

So how do we fix the valuation? After we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3

Ingredients for any  good bull story.  Hype, momentum and FOMO. Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?

You bet! Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centrepiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. Bubbles burst at these G-Forces. 

This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.

Thank you for your service! Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was. 

All brought tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of 1TN+ USD. We gave back some of these gains but the valuation can still be described as ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù lofty.

**4. The short the short shorts short** 

I am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning. 

**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: ‚ÄúNever short Tesla‚Äù, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.** 

As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project. 

And as we have learned, the market really can‚Äôt stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick. 

For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/avdawlazbx891.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eb3d58ef40909c7dd075e46685dc085633efe95

I am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Teslas remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market. 

So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market. 

This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market. 

They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next.

Let‚Äôs try to read a bit into the recent clues. 

1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are ‚ÄúGiant Money Money furnaces‚Äù we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs. 
2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.
3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated. 
4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious. 
5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars. 
6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months. 
7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending. 
8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4. 
9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let‚Äôs see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit. 
10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550. 
11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ‚Öì stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now? 

This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to 200-400 within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking? 

* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow 
* Earnings are next month 
* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading. 

Ok, I am in. How are we playing this? 

If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, you are **TEAM ‚ÄúI might be early but I am not wrong‚Äù‚Ñ¢** **Burry** , you buy puts. Depending on your personal risk tolerance 300 strike puts with 1 month DTE look about right. If you want to play it safe, LEAP puts for January ‚Äò23 should get you going. This is where I am at. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Tesla's valuation might have a short term nosedive.** 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are **TEAM STAN** you buy calls because inflation is over and the price action this year was just a dip. Buy calls or shares, don‚Äôt bother me with the details. 

If you are **TEAM Retard**, you start selling puts on TSLA because the IV is nice and high and the price levels don‚Äôt look all the bad.

When reports surfaced¬†that USC and UCLA had been in negotiations to join the Big Ten on Thursday, Apple was reportedly reinvigorated to engage in media rights involving the Big Ten, according to¬†[Sports Business Journal](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/SB-Blogs/SBJ-Unpacks/2022/06/30.aspx).

Prior to the negotiations and now approval of USC and UCLA to join the Big Ten in 2024, the Big Ten had planned to conclude its media rights negotiations in July as the league was set to surpass $1 billion in annual media rights fees.¬†

However, with Bruins and Trojans‚Äô approval to join the league, the negotiations could stretch to August and may not be completed until after Labor Day, per Sports Business Journal.

As Apple seeks to change its bidding strategy for media rights with the Big Ten, the competition from other networks will be increased as well. Prior to the league adding the two high-profile schools, Fox Sports had secured a deal to carry close to half of the league‚Äôs conference games.

&amp;#x200B;

CBS, on the other hand, was in a prime position to carry some of the Big Ten‚Äôs Saturday football games. With that, Sports Business Journal, Amazon, ESPN and NBC were all bidding for a third package to secure games with the league. Even more, Apple and Warner Brothers Discovery were not viewed as tenable bidders, per Sports Business Journal.

Thursday‚Äôs landmark move of the two Los Angeles-based programs to the Big Ten started in conversations a few months ago. Both schools have been a part of the Pac-12 for quite some time.¬†

The move furthers speculation that college sports is headed towards a ‚ÄúPower 2‚Äù system in which the Big Ten and SEC continue to poach big-name programs from other leagues. The sentiment throughout the college football world is that the two leagues could grow to 30‚Äì35 teams each, operating as a ‚Äúsemi-professional model‚Äù of the sport, per Dellenger.

before you pop your morning dose of Adderall and give your wife's boyfriend a foot massage, let me clue you in on something really important.  The masters of the Economy (And hence the master of the remains of your tech portfolio) are shit scared of inflation. **Jerome Powell, The Fed, Charlie Munger, Biden**, Wallmart, Wallstreet and everybody else is shit-scared of inflation. **Your mother is scared of inflation** (How will she pay for your Wetabix and XBox games tomorrow?).

What is inflation though? Common knowledge is, that **it is the increase of price levels by a surplus of money or a shortage of things**. Too much money, chasing too few things = stuff gets more expensive, too little money, too many things: stuff get cheaper.

So far so easy, there is however a psychological component to it. Companies adjust prices and production preemptively based on their future expectations. In order to protect their inventory and shield themselves from compressed margins they might produce way more than forecasted or adjust forward pricing based on their expectations on their rising cost and higher sales prices. . Producers might start hoarding parts as they might be more difficult to obtain down the road. The great chip shortage appears to be greatly intensified due to the fact that everyone and their mother order way more than than they need just to ensure the other guy is not snatching their inventory.

This is a really hard problem to tackle in times of super intricate global supply chains that try to get everything just in time because warehouses and inventory are surprisingly expensive. (This is also why Amazon will rather burn your returns than deal with them with any degree of intimacy). So as a business owner you have to predict the demand for your stuff, the availability of the stuff you need, the prices of the stuff you need etc. **SUPER HARD**. Remember, everybody has to do it for themselves and the guess what the others are doing. So like when people are rushing into a stock, you have these self-reinforcing systems. (George Soros calls this ""Reflexivity""). This worked surprisingly well for the last 30 years. There is only one issue, the whole organism of global trade is much more fragile than anyone expected. So when this happened:

&amp;#x200B;

[The shitshow that was the last two years](https://preview.redd.it/548iovzlfq891.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fc962dc0e58710f5f1e1445b70e537cb509376e)

The models did not really capture the dynamic nature of reality completely. The infinite money glitch from the fed was just the icing on the cake. So what we got was a perfect chaos and weird, hard to predict effects like:

* Negative Oil Prices
* Liquidity bubbles in Housing, Stocks, Sneakers etc.
* Weird shifts in demand due to work from home and 7 Billion people changing their lifestyle completely, all at once.
* Used cars costing more than new cars,
* GPU's retailing for 3x the normal price.
* A global shortage of Toilet paper.
* An insane shortage and price bubble in Lumber and construction prices.

This send shocks up and  down the supply chain. As today prices very dependent on expectation of tomorrows prices, it caused a lot of distortions. Very similar to how the stock market works where future expectations make up 90% of the whole valuation. So with everyone guessing hard what will happen next, the next you can end up with something like this:

[The bullwhip effect \(https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bullwhip\_effect\)](https://preview.redd.it/lzcp3idsfq891.png?width=1875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da4714ea3f260649e489936e4cf4ef4544438199)

As our good friend Michael J. Burry points out here so nicely is, that the dog has a really long tail, and that the predictions of all the market participants when it comes to inventory, prices and supply drive a really, really long tail.

**This brings us to the problem of measurement.** As you might have heard, the means to measure inflation predate the second world war and not really doing a good job or even attempt to model the chaotic nature of reality described above. You buy a couple things that are roughly the same each month (**CPI**), you try to smoothen it a bit by  excluding strongly fluctuating (Food, Energy) items (**Core CPI)** you ask about of producers how the are feeling about the economy (**PPI**) and then you can estimate where you are **right now.** You can try to make a prediction by drawing the line a bit further out but this is as helpful as technical analysis on penny stocks that we all are so tired off.

One should keep in mind that these are simplified mental model based on our incomplete information of the parameters involved and the inability of the human mind to grasp the incredible complexity of large scale, chaotic systems. Or as my good friend Jerome Powel uttered on yesterday

&amp;#x200B;

[We overshot a tiny little bit, maybe.](https://preview.redd.it/15jexiqvfq891.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a859f20c5b60f96bfce983473aaa6d75ac5c035)

&gt;**Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell admits 'we now understand better how little we understand about inflation' and insists 41-year high prices were 'unpredicted'**  
&gt;  
&gt;[**https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html)

So what that all really means is that the inflation we are measuring today, is something that potentially is caused by effects that are long past us. Due to the nature of long, intertwined supply chains and relatively comprehensive disruptions of shipping and transportation markets, we really have no clue when and how today's numbers where actually made.

**So, if nobody knows anything at all,** why am I even even reading this?

The answer is, **that there are clues of what happens next.** In order to get a feeling where we are right now, lets have a look of the start of any (physical) supply chain, commodities:

[Coming down good already. ](https://preview.redd.it/dt59g0u8gq891.png?width=2629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d01abacc2bc2f5dcbeb4defb2125ebd88cc7d5)

As you can see, these are **not charts of runaway prices.** There are of course spikes, for instance in lithium but commodities as a whole have relaxed quite a bit from the recent peaks.

Lets have a look at some shit people are actually buying instead of some made-up basket from the last century.

&amp;#x200B;

[GPU Prices are coming down hard. https:\/\/www.techspot.com\/article\/2465-gpu-pricing-update\/](https://preview.redd.it/xrx10uxdgq891.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=954f1504a7d924985258db902f90f1b416ea8c23)

&amp;#x200B;

[Retail shelves are full again.](https://preview.redd.it/cjewvcdhgq891.png?width=1432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23127f5626f2ddd06ad22e7142d20611a7c48bd4)

&amp;#x200B;

[Used car prices have leveled off: https:\/\/www.cargurus.com\/Cars\/price-trends\/](https://preview.redd.it/e2x3b9pjgq891.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8eac76f7868585e40c44f3af631c70a950b7fbaa)

And everyone's darling investment, homes:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Shipping cost is on the retreat too \(https:\/\/fbx.freightos.com\/\)](https://preview.redd.it/wmg94b4pgq891.png?width=1771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44c485bb7ec8b9bf0b2f28bf3b3108b0907297f6)

&amp;#x200B;

So these are just some isolated (and of course cherry picked) examples but it should illustrate that things are a little (**a lot**) more nuanced than the red-hot monthly readings are suggesting. It might actually be, that inflation **has already peaked and the worst is behind us**. Which leads us to the most interesting question:

**Should I buy calls or puts now?** Well, this really depends. As you maybe know, the fed uses interest rates to accelerate or brake the economy by making money cheaper or more difficult to borrow (in simple terms). This works because the more money you have,  the more shit you can trade and make and buy. Less money is taking the oxygen out of the room. Lets overlay the fed balance sheet (which is a reasonable benchmark for money supply) with the SP500 to see if we can spot any correlation (how much two lines like each other)

[A little bit of overlap, maybe \(https:\/\/www.currentmarketvaluation.com\/posts\/2021\/07\/Fed-Balance-Sheet-vs-SP500.php\) ](https://preview.redd.it/zscck4ovgq891.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3baab1ae3556e87b0bfebdd9a92252e310e90e4)

&amp;#x200B;

As we can see they are somewhat correlated. So to summarize:

**When inflation numbers are high**, the Fed raises rates in order the choke the economy a bit. As a consequence the price of shit goes down or at least does not raise anymore.

**When inflation numbers are low**, the fed can push the pedal a bit more and make money more widely available. This makes everyone a bit richer and stimulates the economy. This is desirable as it means more jobs and more shit to buy, in general.

Historically the markets are relatively resilient. They survived the great depression, world wars, oil shocks, wars and what not. Generally investors are fine as long as they have a feeling where things are going. Right now, nobody really knows shit and these inflation readings are the number everyone is focussing on because it will in last consequence mean the difference between another bull mania or a long and painful bear market.

**So should I buy puts are calls now for fucks sake?**

Easy.

**If you take the blue pill** you are on **Team Bear Gang**, you submit to the great uncertainty and you are scared of runway inflation. **You buy PUTS** because you believe it will be necessary to kill the economy for a quarter or two to bring down inflation.

**If you take the red pill** you are on **Team Burry** and make the bold contrarian bet that inflation has already peaked and it is likely that we see a nice reversal, especially in the battered down tech sector (Zuck, I still love you). **You buy CALLS** because you buy when there is blood in the streets and the worst is already behind us.

**It you take the pill with the Mitsubishy Logo** you are team smooth-brain and believe it does not matter, because we will have a strong reaction either way and the **VIX** at **29** is super low, considering the uncertainty that we are facing currently. **So you buy PUTS and CALLS** because the market will either go to shit like 2008 and we did so nothing yet, or we have another face-ripping rally like in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Nobody knows what is going to happen but there is opportunity in guessing how wrong we are about inflation.

**It you take the pill with the Mitsubishy Logo** you are team smooth-brain and believe it does not matter, because we will have a strong reaction either way and the **VIX** at **29** is super low, considering the uncertainty that we are facing currently. **So you buy PUTS and CALLS** because the market will either go to shit like 2008 and we did so nothing yet, or we have another face-ripping rally like in 2020.

Im in the business of liquidation and have recently seen a large spike in auctions from these retailers on a website called [liquidation.com](https://liquidation.com) which is a subsidiary of Liquidity services which also owns govdeals and some other websites. 

&amp;#x200B;

**LQDT is a company that flourishes when others are down**

Liquidation is a interesting business we make more money when people go out of business cause liquidation companies are usually put in charge to liquidate a companies assets quickly. A set % is usually charged so the more merchandise sells the more profit the company makes. In liquidation everything has to go and since 75% of the time you are not the owner of the merchandise and only a middle man you get your percentage because the items will sell no mater what since its in a auction setting.

**LQDT has gone up during the past 2 recession**

**LQDT** hit about 40 dollar during 2011 and about 27 during peak covid. I started buying LQDT at around 13.50 and its currently sitting at about 14.20. I own about 2500 shares of the stock as well as 500 $20 aug exp option contracts. The option contracts will expire shortly after lqdt next earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

I might not be a insider in the company but im a direct seller and buyer on liquidation and I've seen the immense change of merchandise sales on the platform. And all I know when everyone is selling thats telling me that this merchandise is not selling in stores. When you buy LQDT your essential betting against companies like target Walmart amazon cause these are the companies that will suffer during the upcoming recession.

GPUs aren't the main story with AMD, CPUs are

the most successful semiconductor company over the last decade AMD reveals Zen 4. Zen is the codename for a family of computer processor microarchitectures from AMD, first launched in 2017 with the 1st gen of its Ryzen CPUs. It is used in Ryzen (desktop &amp; mobile), Ryzen Threadripper (workstation/high end desktop), &amp; Epyc (server)

RYZEN, a combination of 'horizon' &amp; their codename 'zen' &amp; EPYC, connoting a 'new epoch' or 'era' in server computing, &amp; change of 'epic' scale

AMD Ryzen microchips are used in Tesla cars replacing the Intel Atom chips

Tesla started installing an upgraded accelerated processing unit (APU) in the newly-built Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y cars ‚Äî the AMD RDNA 2-based Ryzen APU. Before this upgrade, the Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y had the basic low-level Intel Atom graphics processing unit (GPU)

Tesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, &amp; much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it‚Äôs going to regularly update its computers with more performance. that‚Äôs both for driver-assist/self-driving systems &amp; for the media center &amp; that is a scientific fact

AMD is designed into data centers by some of the world‚Äôs largest hyperscalers. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Tencent Cloud

MS analyst reinstated¬†AMD¬†overweight $103¬†price target, I think $180 is to be fair ... I see a more¬†attractive valuation following the recent pullback in AMD which can rise 120%.

For those not in the know, the Ryzen (formerly Atom) is responsible for handling infotainment duties on Tesla EVs. It‚Äôs directly responsible for the screen's responsiveness when activating menus, playing games, loading apps like YouTube or Netflix, &amp; swiping around the navigational map &amp; the new AMD Ryzen chip absolutely smokes the old Intel Atom chip

Tesla originally used Nvidia SoC's in its older vehicles, but switched 3 years ago to Intel' Atom CPUs for the infotainment centers in Model 3 &amp; newer versions of the Model X &amp; Model S. Tesla now switched the Model S &amp; X to AMD chips, &amp; completing the transition with the Model Y. Tesla's new AMD graphics chipset has PS5 Performance

Tesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, and much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it‚Äôs going to regularly update its computers with more performance, that‚Äôs both for driver-assist/self-driving systems and for the media center

I am citing¬†strength in AMD's partnership with Tesla &amp; its server business warrants a higher multiple due to a wide moat &amp; growth trajectory, the valuation is really compelling. NVDA has been the winner up to this point, now it's AMD's time to shine, as it's notably cheaper than NVDA based on multiple valuation metrics

I am not too scared about whats to come, and I am looking at taking the opportunity to buy some new stocks at these discounted prices. I am 30, if that makes any difference. I like the high growth, high risk plays.

Canada's technology sector has grown rapidly in recent years, as homegrown startups and foreign giants set about hiring hundreds of thousands of well-educated and talented workers. But that expansion has recently slowed to a crawl, as high inflation, interest rate hikes and a downturn for cryptocurrency have taken a lot of optimism out of the sector.

Chris Albinson, CEO of Waterloo-based incubator Communitech, says the pullback in the U.S. is more pronounced because there are more of what he calls ""go for the moon"" companies with dubious fundamentals suddenly finding themselves unable to adapt to the new reality.

Canadian tech companies are faring comparably better at the moment because generally speaking they are much better stewards of capital, he says, but that doesn't mean there isn't anxiety.

""There are some founders that were 18 years old when the last recession happened,"" he told CBC News. ""There's going to be stress on the system, but I think they're ultimately going to come out of that much stronger.""

Valuations for tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Apple and Netflix have cratered in recent weeks, and where once there was a fierce war for talent, many tech giants are implementing hiring freezes and even cutting staff.

U.S. streaming giant Netflix announced Thursday it's cutting another 300 jobs, the second time in as many months it has announced layoffs of that size.

Crowdsourced website layoffs.fyi has documented more than 20,000 tech job cuts in the past two months alone, mostly in and around major U.S. technology hubs like Seattle and San Francisco.

While cutbacks in Canada are less dramatic, they are happening.

Canadian financial tech unicorn Wealthsimple laid off 13 per cent of its staff last week, citing ""unprecedented"" levels of volatility in explaining the cut of roughly 160 positions. ""Many of our clients are living through a period of market uncertainty they've never experienced before,"" CEO and founder Michael Katchen told staff in announcing the news.",Technology layoffs show high-flying sector not immune from slowdown,1.0,2022-06-24 09:52:14

I do not watch TV. I have t in years. This father's day I thought it would be fun to get my dad a subscription to a streaming service. He occasionally watches TV and he really likes storage wars and pawn stars because he used to fix vintage guitars and jukeboxes and he like knows all about the junk on those shows.

Anyway, there's a show I've seen clips of that I thought he would love about Ozzy Osbourne and his son Jack and they drive around and look at cool stuff, and I'm like this is perfect for my dad. 

So I Google the show and it turns out you can get it one of two ways. 1 you can buy each season individually on Amazon for a total of like $60. Or you can have an A&amp;E package with cable. 

At this point I wasn't going to buy a cable subscription for him, but I checked out the prices anyway.

Bro, you people who pay for cable are insane. Some of these monthly subscriptions were close to $100. Fuck that.
$15 a month for NETFLIX is a steal. I had no idea the price was so competitive. And you can cancel any time and go watch a show on another provider. Last month I cancelled my Netflix, bought Crunchyroll and watched all the demon slayer episodes, then cancelled and just got Netflix again.

If nobody wants to work, conditions could get improved or these companies could dip. Cheaper labor or more expensive labor? What do you think the little corporate greed demons are gonna do?

**On April 26, 2022**, a PR was released stating TC energy eyes Crossfield site for low carbon hydrogen production hub in partnership with Nikola Corp. ([https://nikolamotor.com/press\_releases/tc-energy-eyes-crossfield-site-for-low-carbon-hydrogen-production-hub-162](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/tc-energy-eyes-crossfield-site-for-low-carbon-hydrogen-production-hub-162))

There are more Press releases out there but for the sake of the post‚Äôs length this is all I will be adding. You can search for more.

**Partnerships**

Confirmed Partnerships with: TC Energy, Univar Solutions, Iveco, PGT Inc Trucking, Fowler Farms, Walmart, Biagi Bros, Anheuser-Busch, Wagner CAT. (I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a few more) Together these companies have a Market cap of 444 billion dollars. They are all driving/testing Nikola EV Semis.

Rumored Partnerships with: Coca Cola, Pepsi Co, UPS, and Amazon.

Walmart recently confirmed their partnership with $NKLA not too long ago out of the leaked document. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before the big news drops for the rest.

Another hint that caught my eye was the following tweet from Nikola themselves.

The truck has brown trim and what appears a UPS driver. 

The risk to reward on this company is extremely great for me to pass up.

**NKLA institutional ownership Activity**

In the last 3-4 weeks there has been heavy institutional activity.

[Big Names loading the boat](https://preview.redd.it/b0m9p1y1c6691.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b3615cf106de72538a2e81600497bbe5e94b77e)

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the stock market taking a shit these last few weeks, $NKLA has proven to be resilient. The stock has an all time low of $4.82. Even with recent recession fears, $NKLA has set really good support and the price just won't drop below $5 even though I wish it did to load more shares.

Of course there's also the risk of $NKLA going to $0 but let's be real those rumors are old. The Risk to reward is extremely high. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

*There is a lot of information publicly available about Amazon, detailed quarter-to-quarter analysis and strategies discussion that I do not want to replicate.*

Traces of greatness:¬†

* Very consistently high revenue growth; only 3 out of 26 years had less than 20% growth rate
* Consistently high gross margin growth with only 2021 having less than 20%¬†
* Increasing gross margin from 20+% to more than 30% from 2015
* Marketing costs as a percentage of revenue have been reduced; demonstrating the strength of the Amazon brand.
* Fulfilment and Research and Development costs as a percentage of revenue have been increasing. Amazon is still reinvesting to be more vertically integrated into its supply chain.
* Mostly in net cash position
* Always having a positive operating cash flows

Starting as an online book retailer, it transformed the platform to sell more stuff (digital and physical) by improving the fulfilment infrastructure as well as its cloud computing (AWS). It still remains a much-feared disruptor.

Also, many looking at their very consistent revenue growth with increasing margins may have mistaken that the last 27 years had been ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù with no crises¬†or challenges (such as the dot-com bubble burst, 2008 Great Financial Crisis, US-China trade wars, Covid) and they have been ‚Äúperfect‚Äù with no failures and no hiccups. It is indeed a remarkable performance that Amazon has been able to grow so well regardless of the situation.

However, I predict Amazon will soon offer Prime members the ability to just receive things Amazon thinks they would like (at a discounted price) with free returns.

It will probably initially start in high-end urban apartment complexes which offer high geographic concentration of Prime members to minimize logistical costs.

There will likely be Amazon lockers in the apartment lobby. This would simplify returns as then you could just leave anything you don't want in an assigned locker without needing to repackage it.

Based on what you keep and return, their predictive modeling will get better and better.

Do you see any potential in the recent Amazon split and upcoming Google 20:1? Are these Blue Chips, stocks that our dads wished they invested in before the price was to high for the average investor, going to be more attractive now that they are ""affordable"". I know that splits are have no intrinsic value, it doesn't mean that they are actually ""cheaper"" but it does have a phycological affect on average traders who don't have millions to invest. I'm more inclined to purchase Amazon and Google at $100+ and own ""more"" whole shares, than spend limited capital on a few or have fractional share (I'm with TD, so I don't have the ability to purchase fractional shares yet.)

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my strategy was to purchase Amazon option calls before the split, that expire next Friday (Jun 10), with expectations that the price will go up next week. I also purchased Google calls well in advance anticipating the price will go up in the weeks prior to the split. These calls expire the day of the split and some in August.  What are some of you all doing, if anything?

I think we hit the market bottom so I am personally all in on FNGG.  What is interesting are the holdings:

I like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:

I would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.

At the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.

I saw that Mr. Burns looking moron give an interview lying through his crooked, yellow, rotten teeth about how this is meant to protect the consumer against risky investments. 

So if an investment is risky it constitutes it as a meme? If so, is 90% of tech a meme? Netflix is down from 700 to 200, is that a meme? How about Paypal being down from 300 to 80? Both a part of a long line of profitable and sustainable tech companies that have possibly cost some investors a much larger absolute amount/percentage than what the SEC calls a meme. 

My idiot cousin, who ""works"" as a broker, said it's easy to know what a meme is...just look at WSB and whatever has a bunch of memes about it is a meme. So if we post memes about apple, microsoft, amazon, and other blue chips do they become memes? Will the SEC put them in that category too?

This isn't just idiotic, it's corrupt and very dangerous. The government body meant to ensure the legal trade of securities in this country is actively picking and choosing which stocks to put in a shitbasket called memes.

I had my eye on Amazon stock since it was in the $3,000 then they announced the stock split so i really kept my eye on it. during this gnarly dip in the last month or so, I purchased 120 shares at $2528 and some cents and i thought i got a good deal then but then I have seen it fluctuate down to $2100 a share and saw unrealized losses over $50,000 in my account these past 10 days or so and i was like fuck oh well guess i'm gonna wait til this recession and extreme volatility is over to see it come back to around where i bought it at so i'll sell covered calls against my shares starting June 06 when the stock split is reflected in my account until then

https://preview.redd.it/30jaori30a391.jpg?width=1175&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb9e619d9d21b3ca39a1d317227a6c81575371b

this is an amount of money (and company) i'm okay with sitting on for whatever amount of time so i wasn't tripping too hard and i definitely wasn't going to lock in losses but i really just wanted to undo the trade so I can have a lot of cash for better buying opportunities. these past 2 days Amazon was getting close to $2,500 and it isn't uncommon for expensive stocks to gain or lose $100 a day so I've been sitting at my laptop 630am to 1pm (Californian here) for a few days (which i love to do anyway) and just watching price moves, not stressing but definitely wanting to be liquid again because times are gonna get worse.

so today, market closed at 1pm and i opened up Barron's around 1:20pm and saw a minute old article about how splits are causing momentum in Amazon and some other stocks, so I open up my laptop and see Amazon after hours is at $2527, just $1 under what i bought it at so I placed an All or Nothing order for $2528 and it was filled immediately so I am all cash again and I am just so happy to have my $303,000k back, I realized a loss of $140 and have never been so happy to lose $140 instead of riding this gross volatility wave. the $140 loss is a result of like $0.16 cents I lost per share but who cares

how did a retard like me get any cash at all? i'm a real estate fag and also a southern Californian which is why i talk like a surfer but i love everyone and remember it's not a loss until you sell and remember that one of the great privileges of trading is you don't have to enter ANY position. most times the best thing to do is to do nothing, never invest an amount of money you're not okay with losing or not having access to (without realizing losses) for possibly forever! ily guys",i have never been so happy to lose $140!!!!,1.0,2022-06-02 21:28:11

this amount of money is an amount i'm okay with not having access to and the company is one i'm okay with holding but I really would have liked to undo the trade and be liquid to take advantage of better opportunities during the worsening of the recession because things are looking pretty dire

it's pretty common to see swings of $100 up and down on expensive stocks so these past 2 days during Amazon's latest rally, I have been keeping an eye on my position like a hawk for the entire trading session since it was hovering around $2,500 looking for an exit

today it closed around $2,510 and around 1:20pm (California time) I read a one minute old article on Barron's about how stock splits in Amazon and a few other companies were creating momentum in prices so I open my trading app, see Amazon trading at $2,527 after hours, just $1 below where i bought it and entered an order for $2,528 and it got filled immediately! The $140 loss is a result of the cents amount but i could give AH FUCK about that. I have my $303,000 back and I'm just so happy to not partake in any of the upcoming volatility, rate hikes, job reports blahblahblah

remember everyone, one of the privileges of trading is that you don't have to do ANYTHING. keep an eye on things but you do not have to enter any positions. usually the best thing to do is NOTHING. also NEVER EVER invest more than you are willing to lose, never ever invest an amount of money you're not okay with not having access to (without realizing losses) for an unknown period of time, think forever and never ever invest in a shitty company, Amazon is not shitty. that is all, I'm going to lay by the pool now with a notepad and write a list of things I'm grateful for.

do your due diligence, invest in real estate (that's how a retard like me made his money) and just observe the chaos, don't take part in it. i love everyone here so much ahhhh

The stock opened with a small gap down, my first idea was to take the stock from a resistance level created in the last few days at $94 together with the descending trend line with a target at $92.3.

The trade was unsuccessful, and the stock took me out with a stop after twenty seconds of my entry.

I knew it was not the right timing and my idea was still valid so I continued to follow the stock, after a few minutes the stock stopped at the $95 resistance level and continued to fall to $94, broke the level, and consolidated below it, I entered orders:

Entry: $94

Stop loss - $94.37

Take Profit Point - $93.27 (2:1 RRR) I identified a level after the losing trade from the pre-market and that is why $92.3 was not the take profit point.

Ok apes,

I want excuse me for my English but I'm an Italian APE.

I'm reading so much post that show how the people have no confidence in financial system. Yes we are year since Jan 2021 but we have to believe in our ""weapon"".

We have XXX AMC and (at least) the same number of APE's shares. On 21.11.22 will be the T+90. I'm not saying that we will see an epic run in this date. I trust in Adam Aron and he create APE to have a dilution to help him to pay the debts.

So we have a bomb of three digits potential at 1.5$ at the moment. It's the moment to BUY like 28Jan21 with GME in order to force all short sellers to close their positions. Remember what GME caused to Melvin Capital.

Look at the actual financial situation:

\- CS is in trouble and last week announced to the people to sell their AMC's shares.

\- AMZN, META and other blue chip stocks have bad earnings and hedge funds like Citadel are trying to find money to survive.

I think that there is so much disappointed people that saw their money decrease due to a fraud of Wall Street. I'm here to remind you this message:

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below.

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me. 

 :Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop. 

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms. 

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized 

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization 

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again. 

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1) U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets. 

2) A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back. 

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most. 

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up. 

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well. 

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 17 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

737,1667496743,yl8umy,1,"Netflix's (NFLX) ad-supported tier officially arrives in the United States on Thursday.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. ‚Äî just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about ‚Äî and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk ‚Äî it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‚Äò‚Äômissed‚Äô‚Äô (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

&amp;#x200B;

But at the same time Larry Ellison and Safra Catz at ORCL could not have been more bullish two weeks ago at their analyst day and cloud conference. They confirmed their Cloud business is going to grow by 30%+ this  year. 

The differentiator is that they have not just cloud capabilities but database product and cloud apps. 

ORCL is winning by securing big enterprise deals that are ‚Äúmulti pillar‚Äù. Customers are buying not just cloud but the database capabilities and the apps. ORCL is launching industry specific apps. All in one bundled together. This saves customers tons of money and creates simpler solutions with lex complexity. 

ORCL is basically working backwards up the food chain. They started with apps and are today the biggest player in enterprise apps that companies rely on (Salesforce is big but focused more on front office). ORCL also won the database wars vs IBM and MSFT and is leader there now. And now with the customers hooked on the apps and database products ORCL is rolling our their cloud infrastructure offering. The bundle is cost effective and simpler. 

What about economy? This might be counterintuitive but as economy slows ORCL growth will accelerate. This is because as enterprises seek to cut costs they will move to ORCL to seek a one stop shop simplicity plus cost savings. 

Quote from EVP Operations at ORCL analyst day:

‚ÄúWe are not the legacy vendor in the infrastructure. We are the hot startup. Why is that the case? Because we built the second generation of infrastructure. In fact i think we all argue AWS is now the legacy vendor.‚Äù

Meanwhile ORCL remains laser focused on operational efficiency. All the incumbent players have been focused on revenue at all costs and have not cared about profitability. That is opposite to ORCL. 

In summary by FY 2026 (we are currently in Q2 of FY 2023) ORCL is expected to be doing $65bn revenue with 45 percent op
Margins.",AMZN‚Äôs AWS losses are ORCL‚Äôs gains; ORCL is the best cloud play with differentiated bundled approach. Cloud revenues will be 30%+ this year which was reiterated two weeks ago and valuation 14x P/E,1.0,2022-10-28 09:31:55

The analysts' rating of AAPL is trash. Only .58% returns in a year? What a rookie! Taking a deeper dive into their ratings and predictions, most of these gards put buy ratings at the top of a spike and right before the gay bears came to town!

It gets worse for AMZN! These gards are still giving advice when their track record for the past year is -30%!!!

Buyers main objective is to first attempt a breakout from the daily balance and then attack the weekly balance. Buyers would prefer to hold above 3740 and not let sellers find acceptance back within the weekly value, to demonstrate strength. The most favorable scenario for buyers is to find acceptance above the weekly balance which would target 3880, where we have MA50, and the Weekly Extreme High 3935. Sellers want to negate that scenario by being responsive at the upper end of the balance areas. The first downside target would be the monthly VPOC 3690 and in case we break and hold below, 3650 and the Weekly Extreme Low 3590 comes into play. Note that we closed at the highs of the 5 day balance, meaning initiative buyers are needed fairly quickly or simply the lack of them would attract selling activity.

In Europe, on the other hand, another hike in ECB interest rates of 0.75 points (Thursday) is expected, while the Dutch TTF ( european [$NATGAS](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/natgas) ) drops 10%, reaching -70% from its highs. If we have good news it is likely that the technical rebound that started last week can continue but until we have some encouraging inflation data we will continue to be in a bear market. 

The most important thing is to reduce core inflation which is heavily influenced by the housing market. It is usually always the last to surrender.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Another day of big reversals on Wall Street, with stocks posting their best week since June after a treasury rout stalled. The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It‚Äôs important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It‚Äôs do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

I don't think it necessarily reflects negatively on the upcoming earnings next week. Everybody knows AMZN earnings are not going to be great, and that Jassy has been focusing on prudent, austerity measures. I think this is going to be the theme of the conference call on the 27th and I think the stock might get a modest bump, despite numbers coming in only fair to middling.

I've gotta say, the current culture is currently wrenching itself towards /r/investing and other Boomer investment shit.

Used to be, if some idiot YOLOd everything on something dumb, they'd be king for a day. People would remember the Loss Porn for years later. Hell, you'd even have people saying ""LOL I bet you won't double down"" and encouraging people to *make shitty bets even harder*. This sub was the birthplace of celebrating 0DTEs and FDs and laughing together when they were for nothing.

But now? People bitch that the culture of this sub has been changed by Meme Stocks while unironically telling people ETFs to trade, how to diversify their portfolio, and how to calculate risk. Sure, there was a bit of that in the old old days from a few key members who were this sub's sages, but it was mostly people making wild bets, and them not paying off, then commiserating in the comments together about it.

So, if you're shitting on people for making bad bets rather than joking *with them*, and you've also not placed any bets like a sidelining pussy, then you're just as much a catalyst for the culture change in this sub as anyone else you'd otherwise blame.

Positions: AMZN, RIVN, Trulieve, SQQQ, CRSR, BBBY, GME and a few others this sub would recognize from the old days that are now below market cap.","People who are shitting on folks who made BETS in Wall Street BETS, while unironically giving investing advice like ""don't bet more than you can afford to lose"", are bigger contributors to this sub's culture change than anyone else.

838,1661913303,x21xtw,1,"Did tons of macro economic research in the last two weeks, stared at charts to watch volume and understand market sentiment, checking 1s order sizes to see larger players enter or exit, etc.

I timed the top of the market when I saw AMZN  (and the rest of the market) do a quick jitter down on the day of the top. Other people noticed it too but brushed it off. The medium sized sell made the price of AMZN, QQQ, SPY, etc move down way too much for the size of the liquidation. I took this as a sign of the market being very fragile and oversold so I sold all my AMZN (with margin).

Next day, market started it‚Äôs descent. This caused me to do all the aforementioned research because I‚Äôve lost my money before on the first 2022 crash and I understand how important capital protection is now. I decided to be bearish on the market as a whole.

I decided that Jackson hole speech would be a catalyst for a huge change in the markets because of what the fed was saying vs how the greedy market was acting and not believing the fed and how they were pricing in a fantasy. Blackrock convinced me a bit too, since I‚Äôm sure they would be greedy if the risk was low, but they were ultra bearish.

I place my 130P SEP 2 puts, two nights before jackson hole, unfortunately AMZN went up 2.6% the next day. If this didn‚Äôt happen I should‚Äôve been up $120k from the beginning.

Anyway, I kept buying and liquidating my put positions as the market ebbed and flowed down. I stopped today because I saw the inverse of what happened on the top of the market: very very low volume market buys we‚Äôre keeping the market up. The market should‚Äôve been destroyed today, with the sell volume, but since the top side of the market is all wiped out, there are now huge gaps in ask sizes, causing it to moon upwards with ease. Another possible $100k+ day. I was up 35k and I waited out the action, until the aforementioned was too strong. Ended at 15k profit for the day.

Now ive deleted my trading app and I will time the housing market bottom and buy a nice 3 bedroom house for $600,000 CAD with a 20% down payment :) Which will be the equivalent to an $800,000 house right now, pre-upcoming-crash

**-** **HerbalLife** **(HLF)** got squeezed when Ackman and Icahn duked it out....Icahn won and walked away +$1billion, ***Ackman covered for double his entry, so figure out that loss*** LMAO.

**-** **Tesla** **(TSLA)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $40 Billion in 2020)*** \- *I don't need to hear about how great TSLA is*. TSLA was **THE MOST** heavily shorted stock in the world in mid 2020. How do you think it's so fucking high in value and went ballistic and 10x in less than 1 year? Now its gone literally nowhere for almost 2 years. The shorts getting fucked hard had a LOT to do with TSLA epic 2020 run. Cherry picking here, from Jan '21 to now, TSLA is about even, maybe slightly down -2%. 600 days later, a shit ton of sales and growth, new models, new factories, etc and other good shit, and its gone nowhere because people learned to fear shorting TSLA.

**-** **Gamestop** **(GME)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $20 billion)*** needs no introduction but it was $4 pre-split and in pre-split terms went to $400+ and still sitting at pre-split $120 and about pre-split $200 a month ago. You're telling me GME went from $4 to $120-$200 range because RC is turning it around with NFTs no one gives a fuck about anytime soon? What's his play, sell video games online? Platforms already do that. Or let me guess, going to offer everyone 1 penny for their trade-ins instead of 2 pennies? LMFAO...What moat does GME have that any Megacap like GOOG, META, AMZN, MSFT, etc etc can't copy or do better? Fuck it, Netflix probably has more customers and a better chance selling NFTs than GME LMFAO. Even dare I say Robinhood could probably do it better. 

**Shit does not need to make sense nor be rational.** If your argument against BBBY going to $30, $50, $100, or $500 is the ""value"" of BBBY isn't worth that much and that is an irrational price target, then you are completely mistaken and don't understand how the market works. BBBY could become the world's most valuable company this week if there were enough shorts getting their nuts squeezed off. Of course, this is completely irrational and beyond unrealistic but you get my point. 

Now I know everyone is expecting some epic news release tomorrow and the price to rip to $30 but that isn't going to happen. Stop being dumb and unrealistic. Usual news is not some magical saving grace and automatic doubling of revenue everyone dreams about. The news will 100% give the shorts a reason to attack the fuck out of the stock and since everyone is impatient and a little paper-handed bitch, BBBY WILL drop like a MOFO tomorrow. Stop being little bitches and hold your panties up with those diamond hands. Don't drop 'em for the hedgies. **Stop Losses are for losers!**  


Shills, let's see you change my mind...

**TLDR: Stocks have been squeezed crazy high for ages. Let me repeat to you extra regarded apes in the back. SQUEEZED FOR FUCKING AGES with billllllions in losses. It CAN happen again and will continue to happen over and over and over forever until shorting a stock is illegal.**

* SPY closed up 0.20%
* QQQ closed down 0.23%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 0.71%
* VIX closed down 1.30%

Good evening everyone, hope you all had an excellent and productive day. Today we saw the major indices run into a point of resistance, however we are okay because we saw this coming yesterday! Even with the markets hitting resistance and backing off slightly we are still in a healthy market rally. Not everyday can be a green day! It is actually a huge positive for the markets to take a slight pause before pushing through a resistance zone.

Today SPY started to push through a base that had been formed in late April but backed off to close slightly above the highs of yesterday. We did see a pickup on volume compared to yesterday but it wasn‚Äôt enough to get us through this base. In addition to this base we also ran right into the 200 day Exponential Moving Average, providing some extra resistance. If the market bases here for a few days and we see volume dry up this would be a huge positive and could indicate a larger move coming.

QQQ has a similar story except it was able to hold the ground above the April base. This is a large positive and is showing us that QQQ is acting stronger than SPY. QQQ also saw a slight pickup in volume and closed in the top half of it range. If we base for a bit and with low volume that could indicate a move higher.

**Recap on recent positions:**

I am still holding the positions that I discussed yesterday [here](https://everydaytrades.com/market-outlook-08-15-2022/).

I did however sell 25% off my ON position as it started to drop heavily in the morning but recovered into the afternoon.

I also opened a position in AMZN as it started to push through the 200 day Exponential Moving Average. I have a base price of $145.66 and am currently down 0.62%.

**Potential Setups:**

I am mainly watching the same stocks I posted about [yesterday](https://everydaytrades.com/market-outlook-08-15-2022/).

**Bringing everything together:**

The market may be reaching a point where it need to cool off for a bit. Many of the major indices have gone on large runs since they bottomed in June. It is healthy to take a pause before making more advances. If you have positions with a decent profit cushion it is a good idea to hold and wait to add before we start moving definitively higher.

Let's start off with the obvious fundamental thesis: Streaming is no longer ""the future"", it is basically the present. traditional cable continues its slow decline and streaming platforms are continuing to grow.

Traditionally $DIS $NFLX and $AMZN are seen as the big players in this industry and most others are considered small-fry. This dynamic is clearly visible if you look at the market cap of the major players compared to $WBD. Obviously $AMZN and $DIS have some other revenue streams factoring in but $NFLX at least offers a compelling comparison. Netflix has 220 million subscribers after launching in 2007 with a corresponding current market cap of $101B. $WBD by comparison has 100.8 million subscribers (between HBO max and Discovery+) and a market cap of $38.8B. The ratio of subscribers to market cap isn't too far off here, but what I failed to mention previously is that both HBO max and Discovery+ are less than 3 years old and still growing fairly quickly, while Netflix subscriber count growth is starting to slow down as we have seen over the past few quarters.

$NFLX is trading at a 19.99 P/E. $WBD is trading at a 9.55 P/E ratio. This is IMO a pretty ridiculous gap. $NFLX has been floundering for months. Prices are increasing, they are adding advertising, their ""fast laughs"" feature and gaming endeavors are complete busts. Their product is suffering. I don't say these things to imply that $NFLX is going to 0, I think long term it will stabilize at near current P/E. Instead what I am saying is that it seems backwards to me that $WBD is trading at such a low P/E considering its potential. It appears undervalued.

To speak a bit to that potential: $WBD is quietly and efficiently improving their product, improving their library, and unifying their UX (probably Discovery+ and HBO Max will merge sometime in the next few years). Most importantly, unlike Netflix, $WBD is sitting on an absolute wealth of quality IP. They have also publicly stated that they plan to try and keep costs low as they scale. If management can execute on their plan $WBD can conceivably quickly catch up to and conceivably pass Netflix in subscriber count and in revenue over the next 3-6 years.

So, $WBD is currently undervalued, how best can one capitalize on this information?

Personally. I would recommend stock. I currently have a small stock position in $WBD and I plan to add to it after their ER later this week unless something deeply concerning pops up. The reason I am leaning away from options is because with the recent merger between WB and Discovery there could be significant short term costs reflected on this quarter's ER. Pairing that risk along with the potential that we are in bull trap, I am steering clear from playing this earnings. For those who really want to leverage up I would at least recommend leaps in case this ER is a dud. Analysts have a median price target of $25 but long term I expect us to break above current ATH's before the end of the decade. I'd be more aggressive about my timing but with macro conditions what they are it's hard to be too bullish at the moment.

Full disclosure of biases: I am long streaming. I hold positions in most US based streaming services. Those who disagree with that base thesis should consider carefully.",$WBD is potentially undervalued,1.0,2022-08-01 21:54:31

You can see here that AMZN is starting to see some serious trouble actually. They swung to a net loss to continue the streak and the 6 month look back is the worst one. 15,885 positive to -5872! 

Inventories are up. Why? Lack of demand. Your inventories only go up when you order too much.

AMZN is burningggggg cash:

I have seen alot of companies burning alot of cash lately. Some are smart with it, some are not. 

&amp;#x200B;

A year ago during Q2 2021 AMZN was trading at about 170 after that report. Pre market is about 134 right now so this does represent a 21% decline in the share price by comparison. However these net incomes are declining much more than this and so is the free cash flow. 

While this may or may not be a good deal on AMZN shares after this current rally, the reality is that it probably isn't. Essentially anything that offers a glimpse of hope that things are getting better will spark any rally here. However, what will happen if they report negative income AGAIN the next quarter? What if the cash flows turn out worse next quarter? As a whole no companies are exactly reporting stellar earnings. Sure they beat ""analysts"" estimates but that's just a way the referee can bet on the game and determine the outcome. 

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful, sharp and skeptical. The hype looks good and will probably be good...until it isn't. What's absolutely hilarious about all this is that 3 months from now would be Oct and alot of companies started reporting soft earnings end of June which puts them to report in Sept. 

&amp;#x200B;

So you will have the next round of earnings in Sept and Oct during the most classical periods of historical market crashes in all of history? AND the next fed meeting isn't until Sept? I don't know about you but all this rallying on negative net income's from big names out there doesn't exactly sound like investing, it sounds like gambling. 

Just look at when these GDP estimates come out! 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ymeyxv02ie91.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836d27c88f03e90578e77567c866cf9ce93ade7b

TLDR; AMZN earnings were actually not that great. Net income is negative and some cash flow metrics are down over 200% and one was down 700%. Inventories are rising which has been seen everywhere. Things are lining up based on the next fed and GDP stuff to go into that classical Sept decline and October crash. They are blaming their net income problems for Q2 of 2022 on their Rivian investment of 3.9B in losses. This is likely a real issue but it still shows a sharp decline in net income of 1.9B vs 7.7B a year ago representing a 75% decline year over year! IT ALSO DOES NOT GIVE AN EXCUSE TO JUST SAY HEY MY POOR INVESTMENT CHOICES ARE HURTING MY INCOME IGNORE IT PLEASE. Anytime they ask you to ""ignore"" something, where there is smoke there is fire. 

Positions? Don't fight the trend. Waiting to go all out once we look to be overbought by clearing those early June levels.

903,1658869356,w8v0t6,1,"The narrative around Q2 earnings for big tech has prominently focused around a weakened advertising market, and of course, a recession. But I believe the real elephant in the room is TikTok. Let's dive in.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f83ow09d4zd91.png?width=1648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49dac40e1a7f814e5f47988fc9eaa369ca581022

Once we learned this, the fear was advertising reduction will be felt across the board with big tech, e.g. GOOGL, AMZN, META, etc. And then came the GOOGL print today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fh5sfjrr4zd91.png?width=2496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a388e2121d4d29e4f9c1686cf910c2d30116749

So now i'm reading that GOOGL's miss was better than expected? I mean, they missed. But they're directly looking at ad spend which still grew.... but pretty flat on a YoY basis.   


Let's shift our attention back to SNAP to their DAU's (Daily Active Users). 

https://preview.redd.it/igous7lu5zd91.png?width=3196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2f0983105ab46dc1b5ba603d63ca194ed917b0d

Growth is SLOW SLOW SLOW. 

Someone is eating their lunch and dinner and we all know who that is....TikTok

We all know the DAU for TikTok is increasing, taking marketshare from FB, IG, SNAP, etc. WITH a slowing advertising spend.   


TLDR: Reduction of ad spend is not the main concern for META, it's the combo of TikTok eating market share AND a slowing ad spend market that will send META much lower. SNAP earnings are more comparable to META vs GOOGL's ad spend for Q2.

* SPY closed up 0.19%
* QQQ closed up 1.71%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.42%
* VIX closed up 3.07%

The major indices gapped down quite a bit today but recovered and were mostly able to close positive, with the exception of the Dow. However, the Dow isn‚Äôt as important as the Nasdaq or S&amp;P 500 but I include it in these write ups just to be complete. Today‚Äôs price action was very constructive towards the overall market rally as it showed that early selling was quickly overpowered with buying. Even with today ending positive it is still a time to be cautious and limit exposure, especially since FOMC minutes are being released tomorrow. Typically when there is a Fed announcements the markets are quiet and tend to have low volume until the announcement is over.

[SPY Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/64utvdihxx991.png?width=2252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1a2a1e85e72fb3921fece86dc5fee2653426512)

SPY gapped down 1.40% to start the day and continue to drop and undercut Fridays lows. Volume dried up after breaking the lows and we did not see anymore downside. SPY then rallied throughout the rest of the day to close above Fridays highs. Volume today was slightly higher than Fridays but was still lower than than the 50 day moving average. Overall today was still productive towards the general market rally.

[QQQ Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/hjm5xv0ixx991.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b174bcc9a18d525447571346e2f74540885f997)

QQQ gapped down 1.10%, slightly less than SPY, and quickly gained back is losses and closed well above Fridays highs. There was also an increase in volume but still below the 50 day moving average. QQQ also closed above the 8 day EMA (red line). Overall QQQ had a much stronger day than SPY and may be looking to mover higher in the next few days.

**Recap on recent positions:**

SSO opened approximately 2.20% lower than Friday and continued to drop. I sold half of my position as SSO broke below Fridays lows. I then sold my remaining shares as SSO approached Thursdays lows. Looking back now it would have been nice to hold but there was no way of knowing that in the moment.

As we broke into new highs I opened two new positions in both QLD and AMZN. QLD is a doubly leveraged ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100. I made two buys as QLD advance into new highs to avoid buying all of my shares at once. I also bought AMZN since it appeared to be acting stronger than other stocks

**Potential Setups:**

Since I am in two positions I will mainly be monitoring those and looking to add on the my existing shares.

However, if AAPL is able to break its recent high I would consider adding a small position. Breaking these highs would be another trigger showing the higher low setup is working.

**Bringing everything together:**

Yesterday was a constructive day in the overall market rally. We still have a long way to go but have to start somewhere.

It is indeed brutal out there for digital used car sales companies and no-one has been spared. Fair enough for the onslaught but it also caught Shift Technologies together with all others like CVNA, LOTZ, VRM and many others.

Some reasons why I onboarded on SFT.

**Business model:** SFT is at the same phase as AMZN had first started selling books. Folks did thought that AMZN would fail but it did not. Reasons being the same for SFT why it will not fail. (A) Obsession on customers and not focused on its competitors (B) Building its base on how it should be, used car has and always been a local business and it is regional focused. (C) Operates on a vary low cost base compared to the industry (D) Excellent management &amp; lean corporate structure (E) Constant optimization of the model which works for them

**Revenues / Growth:** This has never been a problem from them. They are growing on a super healthy rate and in 2022 will do 1 billion plus on sales

**Areas for expansion:** They have not gone into financing yet, high margin area. Marketplace is about to launch, subprime they have not even touched it.

**Low cost structure model:** They do not have cost related to outlets, garage.. They are pure digital. Evaluate the car - buy - repair &amp; certify - Sale

**All in house operations:** They operated in closed end-2-end model. This gives them control over the cost than any other competitors.

**Car registration &amp; paperwork:** This is by far the most important piece and they have handled with excellence. When people buy used cars digitally, the biggest worry is to have the correct paperwork in time (e.g. just look the mess at CVNA and others). This excellent work has build their base and helped mouth-2-mouth marketing. This is truly reflected in theirs revenues growth.

**Web traffic &amp; interaction:** Only going up every single day.

**Customer satisfaction:** Rated 95%, does not get better than this.

There are many more reasons but these fills my need to be onboarded. **It's a beauty in making, good things take time.**",$SFT - Shift Technologies :: Shifting from being a trash bin company to a real play in digital used car sector,1.0,2022-07-04 15:21:47

* QQQ closed down 1.24%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.82%
* VIX closed up 1.95%

Today market the end of the first half of 2022. The S&amp;P 500 had its worse first half of a year since 1970 and the Nasdaq had its worst start ever. Year to date (YTD) the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 21.03% and the Nasdaq 30.34%. The current market is attempting to rally but is under severe strain and may fall back down to the previous lows. It is hard to be either long or short because of the whipsaw action like todays mini rally and subsequent selloff.

[SPY Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/ordaxm278y891.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71def4283a483b840da6e52f6f0a5ba38d69ca6e)

SPY gapped down and opened about 1.00% off of yesterdays lows. We then proceeded to see a selloff of approximately 0.75% before rallying to reach the 8 EMA (red line). If this mini rally would have held the market action would have actually been quite productive. Instead SPY sold off after reaching the 8 EMA and closed only slightly up from the open, about 0.25%. Today was slightly helpful for the market rally but not by much, the fact that SPY was able to somewhat hold its ground was good to see. There was also an increase in volume compared to the last few days.

[QQQ Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/2pawcvv78y891.png?width=2262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a580449c99bee81129718786dc9bc3bd2aa2f871)

QQQ behaved very similarly to SPY but closed below its open for the day. This is nothing out of the ordinary for 2022 since QQQ has been hit harder during this bear market. Currently, QQQ and SPY are both approximately 2.60% from their lows for the year, so one rough day could trigger new lows and a new wave fo selling.

**Recap on recent positions:**

I am not currently in any positions and am sitting in cash. I will be looking to go short if QQQ breaks below its lows for the move. I will also be looking to go long if SPY breaks Wednesdays highs. Heavy volume either direction will be needed for this trade to trigger. Ideally we would see a large increase in daily volume if either of these positions trigger.

**Potential Setups:**

Besides the potential with SPY and QQQ there are very few stocks setting up with high probability patterns.

[AAPL Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/qsrdmsv88y891.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d0ea7a3eb989248258b400e62ca352c98f1bcfc)

AAPL is forming a potential higher low setup. The low set today is higher than the low set around the 22nd of June. This setup looks promise because of todays price action closing near the highs of the day after retreating nearly 2.30% during the day. It is important to note that no setup is 100% foolproof, as we can see from earlier in the year on this chart where a higher low failed. These type of setups should also only be bought if the market is in good condition and rising, especially on megacap stocks like Apple that make up a large portion of SPY and QQQ holdings.

[AMZN Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/uqsj58t98y891.png?width=2250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb2e773159260097d587b6a2f3b33f36ecacbfc5)

AMZN has also formed a higher low similarly to AAPL. With this setup the lows are much closer together in terms of price. This may not affect the potential of this trade working but means that a small negative move will quickly invalidate the setup. Both stocks have the potential to trigger but need to have a strong market as well and large volume come through the buy points as they take out todays highs.

**Bringing everything together:**

There are very few slam dunk setups forming, although there are several higher lows that may prove promising. With this weekend being a 3 day weekend we may see low volume tomorrow. This is not the worst that could happen as a calm day may give the market a chance to relax. It is also not the best idea to go on a large buying spree tomorrow as this market is very news driven and may react sharply in either direction. If the indices or individual stocks trigger, only buy a small portion of your initial position so if a quick reversal happens it is not as damaging.",Market Outlook 07/01/2022,1.0,2022-07-01 12:18:34

**Citadel was also fined by the SEC for using algorithms between 2007 and 2010**:

*Citadel Securities, the market-making arm of billionaire hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin, has agreed to pay $22.6 million to settle charges that it misled customers about the way it priced trades, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday.*

*The SEC found that between 2007 and 2010, Citadel used two algorithms to execute stock trades on customers‚Äô behalf that gave investors a worse price for their trades, even when Citadel knew better prices existed elsewhere. The SEC penalized Citadel for failing to disclose the use of those algorithms to clients.*

So the top brokers receiving money from Citadel, Susquehanna &amp; Company all suspended trading...... Focus stays on Kenny (Which is should) but Jeff Yass of Susquehanna seems to fly under the radar. Dont forget he was absent from the Gamestop Hearing....

 I noticed that Citadel, Susquehanna &amp; Peak 6 Investments all have very similar 13F's filled with puts and calls on what would be considered ""blue chip"" stocks. I have noticed these stocks running in similar algo patterns. See here:

943,1656388270,vmdq6c,1,"**Recap on yesterdays market action:**

* SPY closed down 0.38%
* QQQ closed down 0.73%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.20%
* VIX closed down 1.10%

The major indices all gapped up to open and quickly gave back their gains to close slightly lower on the day. Although many stocks closed down for the day this was still a constructive and much needed rest after last Friday's large gains. With that being said, don't get overly bullish just yet. We still have a long ways to go before the market shakes off the past few months.

https://preview.redd.it/6jhdv7bhaa891.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e186bb7dfab3c11d679e8e4f2ef1efc8bf6816e6

SPY ran into the 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) right at the opened and quickly reversed. This was not an extremely strong reversal however, with volume lower than Fridays run up and the average daily trading volume. What would be most constructive is if SPY ranged here for a few days to a week and then looked to advance even farther. SPY could also setup for a high-low by trending downwards slightly and then taking out todays highs. Conversely, if we see strong selling in the next few days this may indicate more downwards action. 

https://preview.redd.it/12taphijaa891.png?width=2256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b0c41e451af189e8656ed8ee9645964af575fd1

QQQ behaved similarly to SPY, however, QQQ actually gapped up above its 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) but still closed slightly below. A week of range trading or even a slight downward trend would be constructive for QQQ as it would give some time before attempting a new advance. 

**Recap on recent positions:**

Before the close on last Thursday I opened two small positions in AMZN &amp; QLD. Both performed very well and Friday and today I was stopped out of both positions. 

https://preview.redd.it/7l0rfzdlaa891.png?width=2248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed024dc7d4b36b0f54dcbcb110cf04df6f7908d

My first shares of AMZN where bought at the pivot point shown by the yellow line. This was at the close of Thursday and as prices began to advance on Friday I bought a small amount of additional shares. Today I sold out of this position for a moderate gain of 1.80%. This is not an eye popping gain but in a choppy/whipsaw market I find it best to take smaller profits.

https://preview.redd.it/nezj0aqmaa891.png?width=2254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04d52ecc2ec9c9780f66e7ec933de830349736d6

QLD also turned out to be a nice buy into the close on Thursday. There was a slightly better base/enter here so my initial position was slightly larger. Again, with Fridays price advance I bought additional shares throughout the day. Today I also sold all of my shares for an average gain of 4.30%. Could I have held to a few shares? Yes. Will I regret not? No. If QLD continues to advance there are several additional entry points possible.

**Potential Setups:** 

Looking forward there are not many stocks that currently have high probability setups.

https://preview.redd.it/n7bqwp5oaa891.png?width=2271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5729199b89cdf2922019bf857601ae98260f3a36

GOOGL was discussed previously and has approached a month long base. If GOOGL can break above the highs set today with a large volume increase this could be the beginnings of a good run.

https://preview.redd.it/pz30koepaa891.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5981174b9c837bad869bcda7954e83b0de20a0b

O is also approaching a monthly base. This is very similar to GOOGL with the only difference being the O is a realty trust and thus may move bit slower in price increases.

A couple of key dates are coming up. The record date for the stock split will be Wednesday, June 22, which is officially the day on which investors have to be shareholders of record in order to receive the additional shares.

The important date for investors is the payment date, which is when the additional shares from the split will go to investors. That will happen after the market closes on Tuesday, June 28. When trading starts the following day on Wednesday, June 29, Shopify stock will trade at post-split levels of roughly one-tenth their pre-split price.

I claimed that I was up around 50% in the last few weeks. u/hoopmbb6279 joked that making $0.50 on your last $1 isn't that hard. I responded that I've gone from about $26k to about $40k, and he asked me to prove it. So here we are.

First of all, it turns out I was slightly wrong. I thought I had gone from $32k to $26k (IRA contribution) then up to $40k, which is where I got the +50% number. It turns out I went from $32k to $35k on some calls, then IRA contribution down to $29k, then up to $40k. So, similar but different.

So you can see, the account had basically nothing it in, about $300. Lucky for me, my wife's boyfriend gave me my allowance for the year all up front so I stuck the $32k in this account. I made a little money at the end of May, made my IRA contribution a week later, and then have made about $11k in the last two weeks.

967,1654704964,v7tcx0,1,"The market has been falling since November 2021. Bezos and Musk sold shares at the same time late last year. Fortunately, I realized that the market could go down, so I also sold most of my stocks decisively, so I didn't lose anything this year. But I know that a lot of people lost more than 30% today.

In a falling market environment, I also try to do some short-term trades. I also do WTI hedging. I have also tried many ways but it doesn't work well. Later, testing stock hedging in a demo account led me to a great method. And in subsequent trades, traded over four weeks using my live account. So far, the deal looks pretty good.

Simply put, a hedging order is set every day. The so-called hedging order is to set long and short positions on the same stock at the same time, and set stop loss, but not set profit. Then, but if the stock goes up or down the next day, the reverse order will be stopped and another order will be profitable.. At this point you only need to manually close the profitable order.

&amp;#x200B;

Below, I'll post some of my transaction details.

My trading results for the first week:

On May 16th, I placed a tsla hedge order at 719. The next day tsla opened, I closed my position at 744, and finally made a profit of 6k;

On May 17th, I placed a tsla hedge order on 754. When the market opened the next day, I closed my position at 746 and ended up with a profit of $1,500;

I lost 4k on the remaining two trades this week and ended up making $3500.

&amp;#x200B;

My second week trading results:

On May 23, I placed an amzn hedge order at 2137. When the market opened the next day, I closed the position at the price of 2083, and finally made 5k;

On May 26th, I placed an amzn hedge order at 2228. When the market opened the next day, I closed the position at 2262 and finally made 4k;

I lost 4k on the remaining two trades this week and ended up with a 5k profit.

&amp;#x200B;

My third week trading results:

On May 31st, I placed an amzn hedge order at 2428. When the market opened the next day, I closed the position at the price of 2441, and finally made a profit of 8k;

On June 2, I set up an amzn hedge order at 2498. When the market opened the next day, I closed my position at 2482 and finally made a profit of 3k;

The remaining two trades for the week lost 5k and ended up with a profit of 6k.

Currently this week I'm trying google's hedge order and it seems to be working fine.

(The difference in profit is also related to the amount of trades I use.)

&amp;#x200B;

This is my actual trading situation for the first three weeks. Do you have the same hedging strategy as I do? Or what method do you use to do hedging transactions.

Of course, there may be better ways to hedge. In fact, in a falling market environment, your stock cannot make money. So essentially, you are already losing money. If your stock loses a lot, it means your losses are even worse. Therefore, we hope that everyone can achieve better returns.

Hope you guys can share your views, or you know a better way to do it.

989,1654264433,v3zx4p,1,"Hello Gents,

I‚Äôm back for another failure of a pick, and I‚Äôve been eating ramen ever since. Let me introduce you to $BROS. What is $BROS

&gt;Dutch Bros Inc. operates and franchises drive-thru shops. It offers Dutch Bros hot and cold espresso-based beverages, and cold brew coffee products, as well as Blue Rebel energy drinks, tea, lemonade, smoothies, and other beverages through company-operated shops and online channels. As of May 11, 2022, it operated 572 drive-thru coffee locations across 12 states in the United States. The company was founded in 1992 and is headquartered in Grants Pass, Oregon.

Sweet. Here‚Äôs a picture from their [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001866581/000162828021018412/dutchbross-1a2.htm) and it‚Äôs what convinced me to invest in $BROS.¬†¬†

Long story short, some firm bottom ticked. They tanked $BROS after atrocious earnings thinking business as usual let‚Äôs destroy another company. Sucks for them, the market and $BROS have been running ever since - ***bottom ticked.***¬†

No way in hell that¬† $BROS down 40% the day after ER is now a couple weeks later close to recapturing a key level of $40 without something being wrong ‚Äî that‚Äôs a better post-er performance than $AMZN $FB $NFLX $WMT $TGT. To recap, $BROS makes coffee ‚Ä¶. specifically in Oregon.¬†¬†

Look at the $BROS graph, now look at $SPY.

$BROS since the ER tank has encountered $SPY death days, however, $BROS has been impervious going green each time. So yah, someone is being fucked on the other side.

The real shorts are in Hawaii right now smoking a bong and patting themselves on the back after destroying firm after firm for 7weeks straight - pure bliss. Bottom tickers are the shorts who wanted one last hurrah with $BROS and now scrambling to defend $40. These guys have been staring at their screen everyday since wondering ‚Äú*why didn‚Äôt I just take the W and stop trading, I could be chilling right now instead of watching this shitco go up everyday.*‚Äù¬†

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4u35hiljue391...*

Below you can see that $BROS can run 15%+ in a day for multiple days. For a stock with this behavior implied vol is low in the 50‚Äôs. Can also see defense at the $40 price level, a key one for $BROS. The screenshot below is from 5/27, as of today (6/1) $BROS has recovered right back to $40. The market is also more conducive now, ignoring FUD and just ripping everyday for no reason.¬†

In conclusion, conditions are right in the market for something stupid to happen. So, purify yourself in $BROS and drink from the waters of Lake Minnetonka.

A better strategy for tracking Pelosi is to only copy her trades of companies headquartered in California and DC, because those are the companies that feed her that good good insider information.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wj7fw6k1z2391.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797e4676ae286a4e85c242f1a49e7c75fe8cfe25

**Background**

We all just wanna trade like Pelosi and ride that sweet insider information to glory. But as I noted in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uu6hc6/if_pelosi_cant_beat_this_market_what_hope_do_we/), Nancy has had a disappointing reversion to the mean after several years of outperformance. Did she get greedy? Was it a classic game of telephone where the information was distorted and led to bad trades? Is she human after all?? Who can say... But it's up to me to figure out how to get our dear Speaker back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

**The New Strategy**

If the opposite of Pro is Con, then the opposite of progress is... This is the kind of high level logic I used to determine where ole Nancy wen't wrong. Surely she's getting insider information from companies, but she has to mask that with some garbage trades (probably sourced from WSB). How can we identify  the good trades from the bad?

Location, location, location.

Pelosi is a powerful figure in California and Washington D.C. It makes sense that she would be connected with companies headquartered in those states. The tech giants of Silicon Valley and legacy companies headquartered in D.C. that keep Congress' pocketbooks full in exchange cost-plus government contracts. **So I made a new Pelosi tracking strategy that follows her trades, but ignores any companies headquartered outside California and D.C.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Results**

That's more like it! This Pelosi tracker is back on top with a 50% outperformance over the S&amp;P 500 in the past 2 years. Even with the massive drawdown to start 2022, Pelosi would be killing it in the market if she just stuck with the companies she's connected to.
