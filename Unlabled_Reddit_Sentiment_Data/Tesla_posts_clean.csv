It is my understanding that most analysts believe that Musk’s erratic behaviour and decision making regarding his recent acquisition of Twitter is driving some of the adverse downside skew to Tesla fundamentals. My concern is the stock is currently in a death spiral given it’s likely overvalued prior price point, and Musk’s use of 62.5 billion of $TSLA for collateral on 6.25 billion investment loans borrowed on margin for the Twitter acquisition. 

The issue is, as Elon’s faithful bussy, every time markets close at a loss for $TSLA Elon will 3d print a large to-scale red candlestick and insert it into me with astonishing vigour. I am not sure why, perhaps as a masochism kink. Thank god Twitter is no longer public as I don’t think I would survive that barrage at all.

$TSLA Tesla is one of the stocks I like to trade the most, I had the stock on my watch from the beginning of the trading day, the stock for the first half hour was without a trend but after it broke the support level and the trend line and came back to check it at the same time the market collapsed and I took advantage of the opportunity that was created for me.

I fully expected as you can see for us to hit 399.2 I was not really a believer that we would hit 405.2 but hit it and broke through it! Wild day! 

&amp;#x200B;

So now lets take a look at what JPOW actually said… 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9p1nc16wv63a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dffc7c0f87ff9f7d9a85cdb45309c093bbd2e7d

So looking at some of the highlights above you can see JPOW said some dovish stuff but also through some hawkish stuff in there. Now comparing it to FOMC from this month we saw a completely different JPOW than we have been seeing. This is the dovish I think I have seen JPOW since January. 

My biggest things to note here is that JPOW expected PCE to continue to come down… we have a PCE reading tomorrow along with another jobless claim. Being what JPOW said these numbers are going to get weighted heavily tomorrow. A miss on these could send us tumbling hard pre market. However, JPOW noted a few different times that inflation is still far too high and far from being tamed…

My biggest question I continue to have is… the FEDS have stated for months now I mean since June probably if not earlier that inflation is not under control and they have not tamed it. However, if we look at CPI YoY we have had 5 decreases in a row now. Granted MoM and Core YoY/ MoM have been all over the place. So if the fed truly believes that… and keeps saying it… when do we get the recoil of CPI and get the big miss? This month? Next month? Next year? Its coming at some point…

Here is a nice zoomed out view of SPY on the daily and weekly… the main thing I want to point out is that dark green resistance line… that effectively is the bear market line for 2022. From a technical stand point IF we break through that the bear trend is broken. We would then make a new higher high and break the 2022 down trend. However, we very well could see a fake breakout and then sell off at a later point. 

For the daily chart that level is 408.4 and for the weekly chart that level is 409.8. That effective means that IF we break through both those levels tomorrow or this week that we just broke through the 2022 bear market resistance and we COULD open up the upside in a big way.

Now that we closed over the purple channel resistance of 405.2 we are going to look for the grey channel resistance which comes in at 419.6. If we break out here and start a santa rally that is the most logical place to expect us to stop. 

However, with this impressive 3.15% green rally today on realistically fluff material and nothing really that overall bullish… we very well could see a pretty massive sell off tomorrow. I would equate what could happen to us tomorrow…

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2m21d7yv63a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f184a97653cc6a4c4fb24ade570f676b6855277d

As you can see on may 4th (which was FOMC) we had a massive rally of 3.05%. IT was a very similar situation too. That day was followed up by a -1.1% red open and a -3.55% red day. It’s a possibility but this market is truly on full bull mode right now. 

Its also noted that today was the highest volume day at 145mil since the October CPI. 

What am I leaning towards? My realistic side says that we might have just put the top in with a massive blow off top and that we could end up with really bad PCE data tomorrow which takes us right back under 405.2… however, I also recognize that this market since even before last CPI has been full bull and this could have just re-ignited their flame to take this through bear market resistance and possibly even 420+. 

Tomorrow should be pretty telling.

We now get to watch overnight IF futures will breakout of that bear market resistance line or not… that level comes in at 4105 overnight for the daily and 4120 for the weekly timeframe. We will keep a really close eye on 4095 overnight as that could lead to a big double top and a retrace back into that red channel. 

Next major upside target will be 4200 for Futures.

Regardless of what SPY did today I was bullish on Tesla… I mentioned earlier in the week that it had broken through the weekly bear channel. However, we had seen tesla massively reject the weekly 200ema when it did that. 

We are not seeing tesla close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September 21st… which was the start of the this two month long drop. 

We might actually see Tesla find its support here and we might see it push even higher over the next few weeks. If we see a push up tomorrow 196.1 will be a major resistance for it to fight at and 204.9 will also be a major resistance to watch. 

Key support- 190.8 -&gt; 185.2 -&gt; 180.1

Even with the pretty big pop IV had intraday today and the VIX pushing green this morning the VIX maintained its bear channel and dropped back under the daily 8ema and gap filled the November 25th gap. 

We are now eyeing once again that critical 19.7 level on the VIX.

*Processing img nloifzy1w63a1...*

I have actually really been struggling with the level to level plays this week. I took a spy call off 395 support this morning that I stopped myself out of at -10.3% that had I let it run it never would have hit my -20% stop and well you can imagine how green that would have been… I also took a Tesla call off of the 180 support area that got stopped out right before the JPOW speech that as you can imagine also turned hella green. 

The only thing I woulda done differently is gone with a further DTE or seen them through. It is always tough playing extremely volatile and high IV days. 

I called out and played a straddle (my document says strangle but it was a straddle). I ended up closing my call side on the first pump to 399.2 and then on the first big retrace closed my puts for a loss. Overall about a 30% win but it was messy and not the proper way to handle a straddle. I had even purposefully gone smaller lotto sized and I shoulda just let it run its course. 

Still a green day and still a pretty green week too. After almost 5 weeks in a row where L2L plays paid more than scalps this might now be my 2nd week in a row that scalps pay more than my L2l plays.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0528z8g2w63a1.png?width=305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f5f7f8f190bb3d939b188a505765eca213bfd51

Doing my monthly round up here. Overall I have had a killer month of scalping that’s for sure… 92.08% win rate for the whole month is probably one of my best months of scalping ever. 

As many of you know I have been weighing my level to level plays and whether or not they are worth it or better than my SPY/ SPX scalps. Looking strictly at SPY l2l plays I see that I averaged a 75% win rate which I expected a lower win rate but my profit rate was very good. Now I have been wondering IF tesla was worth it to keep in my lineup or not. I truly enjoy trading Tesla (probably because its volatile and helps on days that SPY is boring). However, I see that I put in about 50% of the profits on Tesla l2l than I did on SPY l2l. The win rates are not too far off though. 

I am indifferent about whether to continue my tesla L2L plays or not. I think for now I will give this another month or so before I officially rotate it out. The one thing I did notice about my Tesla L2L compared to SPY is that a lot of my profits on Tesla have come from pretty large wins on Tesla overnight swings. 

I will be monitoring Tesla L2L closely over the new week or two and decide officially to rotate it out of my lineup and just focus on SPY once again or not.

* Elon Musk called on the Fed “to cut interest rates immediately” or risk “amplifying the probability of a severe recession.”
* In a similar exchange on Oct. 24, the world’s richest man estimated a global recession could last “until the spring ’24.”
* Elon Musk thinks a recession is coming and worries the Federal Reserve’s attempts to bring down inflation could make it worse.

In a tweet early Thursday, the Tesla CEO and Twitter owner called on the Fed “to cut interest rates immediately” or risk “amplifying the probability of a severe recession.”

The remarks came in an exchange with Tesmanian co-founder Vincent Yu in which several others participated.

Later in the thread, NorthmanTrader founder Sven Henrich observes that the Fed “stayed too easy for too long totally misreading inflation and now they’ve tightened aggressively into the highest debt construct ever without accounting for the lag effects of these rate hikes risking they’ll be again late to realize the damage done.”

Musk replied, “Exactly.”

This isn’t the first time Musk has warned of impending economic doom.

In a similar exchange on Oct. 24, the world’s richest man estimated a global recession could last “until the spring ’24,” though he noted he was “just guessing.” That prediction came amid a slew of economic warnings from other business executives including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.

The Fed appears to be entering the late stages of a rate-hiking campaign aimed at tackling inflation still running near its highest level in more than 40 years. The central bank has increased its benchmark rate half a dozen times this year, taking the overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 3.75%-4%, and is expected to hike a few more times before stopping.

In recent days, Fed officials have said they expect smaller increases ahead than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases, the most recent of which came in early November. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is addressing the public Wednesday afternoon in a speech to be delivered at the Brookings Institution.

With the green open I noted in my pre market analysis that we would most likely come back down to 395 and if we loss that that 393.7 was my button range support for today and spy played that out perfectly.

I was looking for a bigger breakdown on tesla during my pre market analysis today as we were holding onto that 184.8 magnet level. However, I said unless we get a new volatility support level we should expect a break down to 176.7. But we saw a 182.5 support level come in and now we should look for 182.5 to 184.8 to be our new magnet on Tesla.

My intentions today was to play puts overnight for the economic data and JPOW speech tomorrow however, I saw too much of a bullish case on SPY to warrant puts overnight. I considered a straddle but im not sure if we will get a big enough movement to make it worth the capital risked. 

We saw the daily 8ema confirmed as resistance and we broke down o that key 393.7 support level (from the 15min volatility) and that’s as low as we went today. With that EOD recovery and closure back over 395.2 we are actually seeing a potential that we are still trading within that same 395.2 to 399.2 area that we have been trading in for the last 2 weeks. 

This doji after 3 red days could set us up with that 395.2 closure for a move back towards 399.2 tomorrow. However, if this economic data comes in rough and depending on what JPOW says tomorrow at 130pm we really could see 390 or we could see 402.5 tomorrow. I don’t have a strong feeling either way besides I think JPOW continues to be far more bearish than the markets want to believe. 

Support- 395.2 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1

Resistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.5

Futures with a similar break down but held its 3955 support level from the last two weeks very nicely. We have now had 6 attempts to close below 3955 over the last 12 trading days and all have failed. Until we see 3955 support break and we close below that I do struggle to believe in a bigger bear case. 

Support- 3955 -&gt; 3935 -&gt; 3910

Tesla is a tough one here as I really do see a bear case and a bull case. 

For the bear case we rejected at 185.2 for the 2nd day in the last 3 trading days. This is the 5th rejection at 185.2 in the last 8 trading days. As you can see highlighted in blue we are in this overall bull channel here but we are rejecting at the bigger macro falling wedge here in red. This is our 2nd day of rejecting the falling wedge resistance without breaking through. 

However for the bull case we attempted and for a while we were looking like we would break through 180 support and close below that which would have resulted in a bearish engulfing daily candle. Despite the closure below the daily 8ema failure to have a meaningful sell off today and to lose that key 180 support does open more upside. 

Key support- 180 -&gt; 173.6

Key resistance- 185.1 -&gt; 190.8

The VIX did a whole lot of nothing today. Holding within yesterdays range pretty much all day but it did close below its daily 8ema support again. The VIX does not really give us any sort of direction either. These 3 dojis in a row show indecision in the market and show that we very well could with todays gravestone doji see the VIX unwind tomorrow and look to gap fill at 21.11. However, with JPOW speech tomorrow and with all the economic data tomorrow we very well could see the VIX move up and possibly even touch that bear channel resistance at 22.7 tomorrow. However, in order to be full bear I would like to see a closure over the daily 20ema which should be near 23.61 tomorrow. 23.6 also happens to be our lower channel resistance level too. Breaking back over 23.6 opens up a move to 28.5 area.

Overall today was a great day. I had another great day with scalps… im currently on streak of 14 wins in a row on my scalps over a two week time frame… 

I got burnt in both spy and tesla calls this morning when that rogue 1030am hour long $4 drop came in. But that’s where stop losses are key and save us on flash crashes like that. 

Other then that I was able to get some nice smaller wins today with the only other loser coming from Tesla calls playing the 180 support bounce but unfortunately was stopped out on the fake breakdown at the start of power hour only for the position to have gone green again (had I held). 

Overall really a great day with no complaints.

25,1669729872,z7unfs,1,"“Our investor survey reinforces our views that Elon Musk's recent involvement with Twitter has contributed to negative sentiment momentum in Tesla shares,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.

Tesla  (**TSLA**) investors see Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter as having both a negative impact on the carmaker's share price and the potential to ultimately erode its underlying fundamentals, a Morgan Stanley survey indicated Tuesday.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a long-time Tesla bull, noted the bank's recent investor survey found that nearly two-thirds of those polled said Musk's $44 billion purchase of the social media platform would have a ""slight negative"" or ""very negative"" impact on Tesla's business. Around 30% felt Musk's involvement would be ""neutral"" for the carmaker, while only 5% saw it as a net positive. 

Jonas, who carries an 'overweight' rating with a $330 price target on Tesla stock, said last week that while the ongoing distraction of CEO Elon Musk's foray into Twitter will likely expose investors to added risks, the group remains on pace to grow sales by around 37% next year, generate $15 billion in free-cash-flow and consolidate its position as the word's dominant EV player.

“Our investor survey reinforces our views that Elon Musk's recent involvement with Twitter has contributed to negative sentiment momentum in [T](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA)esla shares and could drive some degree of adverse downside skew to Tesla fundamentals.”

Tesla shares were marked 1.4% higher in pre-market trading Tuesday to indicate an opening bell price of $185.53 each, a move that would still leave the stock down more than 50% since Musk made his intentions to buy Twitter public in early April.

Last week,  Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli lifted his rating on Tesla to 'neutral' from 'sell', while boosting his price target by around $35 to $176 per share, arguing the stock's year-to-date decline of around 58% has ""balanced out the near-term risk/reward"" for Tesla investors.

""To be sure, macro/competitive concerns are likely to remain an overhang with capacity rising, but as we’ve previously written, in a hard landing scenario Tesla’s long-term competitive position likely also improves and potentially further enhanced by (President Joe Biden's inflation reduction act),"" Michaeli wrote.

Interestingly enough… after 393.7 support if we lose that volatility wise we have no real established support area until all the way down to 373.7. Could we be headed for a CPI gap fill over the next few weeks?

I believe we have quite the bear case forming here on spy with a smaller bull potential. But lets take a look at what we have here now…

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqlsg5qhgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203546bf0ee653d203b63ec303e2c475d05f5080

Looking at SPY daily here I called out on Friday that I suspected that tiny gravestone doji double top rejection at 402.4 would open up the downside for today and I was correct. I should have played weekend swing puts but I was happy to sit cash as the weekends are pretty unpredictable as of late. 

Bear case- today we opened red and attempted to retake the daily 200ema however was unable to, we broke the 3+ week long daily rising wedge pattern and we closed below the daily 8ema for the first time since the day before CPI. 

Bull case- despite the rejection and closing under the daily 8 and 200ema we did bounce pretty hard off the key support range of 395 to 395.5 today. We are still maintaining that key lower support range of this consolidation pattern that SPY has been in since November 11th. 

For me this breakdown shows that we have a potential to retest 390.1 support and potentially even lower depending on what JPOW says on Wednesday and depending on what all the economic data comes in at. I am bearish until we touch 390.1… If we touch and bounce off 390.1 again then I am seeing a nice consolidation channel from 390.1 to 402.5 and will play it at such. However if we break through and close under 390.1 then I am looking for at minimum the gap fill at 381.2. 

Key support- 396 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1

Key resistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.4

Much of the same case here on futures breaking that rising wedge. However, futures is still holding over one of the key support levels of 3970. If we see futures lose 3955 then I would feel confident in a 3910 retest of support. However, if futures can break back over 4000 we can start talking about a retest of 4020 and then 4040.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla has the biggest bearish case of them all in my opinion when we look at the daily chart. We had that green support line that was 3 days long until today. That line was broke through today we also failed to even reach the falling wedge resistance line before we retraced. With this gravestone doji closing at Fridays candle body support of 182.9 this should open up some pretty large downside tomorrow. The only real bullish case I see for Tesla right now is that it did recover and close back over its daily 8ema EOD. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sb5nbidjgr2a1.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e956cfe851e89a8798726f581aa3fa6c67216bc

Last week I shared with you guys that tesla had a pretty uniformed drop and recovery cycle. I was seeing that we were averaging a drop of about 6.8 days for 17.82% while the recovery was about 4.5 days of 12.08%. 

With todays new short term high we officially put in our 4th recovery day and reached 13.4% total recovery. 

If we are trusting this trend that has been playing out for 3 months now that means we should expect about a 7day sell off of about 17.82% which puts Tesla at 154.9 around December 7th. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1l8qyrtjgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7af3c1395a4edfaa0271107bcd192d0826b9512

If we play out the falling wedge here by December 7th we could see 148.7 which is a total drop of 21.2%. However if we play out the % drop of 17.82% but not the number of days it took to get there we could see by November 30th (2 days) a touch of the red support line at 154.5. 

Realistically I would look for a test of support near 148-155 in the next 4-7 trading days. Biggest support to break through though will be that 166.2 level. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb5x4lckgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060a5fcfcccf160399b111c5fc56bbba73474559

I don’t love post weekly charts so early in the week but we did break through the blue resistance line of this current downward trend today. However we immediately rejected and hard rejected off the weekly 200ema. Key support for this weekly timeframe is 180.1. This current bear channel (thick red support line) gives us intraweek support of 154 and next week support of 152. 

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I was looking for that 19.7 touch this week it appears that as of now we may not get it. We officially closed over the daily 8ema for the first time since October 14th. We are still in this bear channel though and its not quite time to get super excited but this is not a bad time in my opinion to start adding to some 30-60dte put positions.

Was able to get a nice put scalp in this morning for the $5k challenge. Still haven’t quite been able to get any good big scalp wins but I also don’t want to stretch these plays out. This is one of those times where if I had a standard position size (usually $2000 for me) I would sometimes hold a little longer but with this larger bigger $5000 position I am more apt to quickly take profits and to take the first hit of profits. 

This is where the emotional side of trading comes in.

Overall not a bad day and a great way to start the week off. Almost love starting the week off with a nice green day. Scalps were on fire today even if I closed them all early AF only for them all to 3-4x right after… but profit is profit! 

Some struggles with the level to level plays this morning. The first SPY put I played the bounce off 399.2 support however it was a fake bounce and broke down pretty quickly and I got out. I was just unfortunately too early on that first Tesla put and got stopped out before it saw green. 

Not a bad day.

Spy had the tightest range day I have ever seen it had not even breaking a full $2 move and we also saw IV in the teens and even hit single digits EOD. The IV right now is at the lowest I have seen it in months.

This is the best chart I could find (for free) to show historical trends… but as of today the IV RANK (blue line) is at the lowest level it has been at since April 4th (4 days after the March/ April peak) and IV percentile (green line) is the lowest it has been since November 21st 2021 (which is when spy was hitting 472.4 resistance and closing in on its ATH. While the actual IV % hasn’t really been too helpful trend wise we are seeing though that when the IV rank hits these levels is when we have typically seen the peak put in. this also is correlating well with us closing in on that 2022 bear market resistance line which on the weekly time frame has us right around 410 for next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r7s2dwxnt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e618ec5bdc747a7776531bce5288bed48b9824

When we look at the daily chart here we can see we have put in some pretty stout resistance right there at 402.4 with two candle bodies rejecting it and the November 15th wick hitting that level too. 

This is our key level until we close over this level I am going to start looking for a retrace. There is a pretty good chance come Monday that we see that blue rising wedge support broken. We need to see SPY open over 402.4 and hold it all day otherwise that rising wedge is broken and I will expect a retrace. However, if we can hold that support then I don’t see a reason why we don’t touch that 405.2 channel resistance. 

The daily candle while small is technically a gravestone doji with a double top, however, due to the short day today and the overall low IV I wanted to wait till Monday to act on this. I don’t trust this shorten day to make a full play on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty similar picture here on the weekly. Unless we open over 403.3 and hold that support all week we break the weekly support and will see a sell off back to the 390 to 398 range. 

If the weekly can find support and a green open I will look for 408.9 channel resistance and then the bear market resistance line is that 410 as I mentioned earlier. 

Interestingly enough this is actually the first back to back green months that SPY has put in all year and the first back to back green months since July/ August 2021. 

I am going to watch this weekly rising wedge closely and watch that 410 bear resistance closely. I did decide to sit cash all weekend so that I could see what Monday brought and while I note IV is the lowest it has been in months I wasn’t quite willing to take a risk on a play over the weekend.

Much of the same here on Futures as we did back test and hold that daily 20ema finishing with a doji here. However, on Futures you can see that it actually turned 4033 previous resistance into support with 4050 being the next resistance. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is a little hard to tell but on the Futures weekly this week DID fail to make a new high. Last week touched 4050.75 and this week saw a high of 4049.25. With the weekly 50ema clearly being resistance this is going to be our key level to watch next week of 4050. However, we have found really nice support on the weekly 20ema down near 3925. 

That blue rising wedge support line sits at 4050 and unless we open and hold that then we should expect a retrace next week. 

Bear market resistance for futures weekly sits at 4120 for next week with key level resistance at 4085.

So looking ahead to next week… we got some gnarly data coming out AND we got JPOW speaking at 130pm Wednesday where he WILL be answering questions. Honestly with this economic data lineup I would not be surprised to see a choppy Monday/ Tuesday (maybe slightly green) and see a pretty large sell off the rest of the week. 

Looking at tesla it was once again the victim. Having yet again another large pre market that by open was miniscule and led to a red day. This may be the third or 4th time in the last two weeks I have seen this happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/98ttt3lqt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8baa5ded2708a51d68c34a5d8e1d785f38c89af

I posted this analysis of Tesla and its history of drops followed by pops since September. Well we are at day 3 of the pop and we are looking at about a 11.7% move from that bottom to current HOD. That’s pretty damn close to the average 4.2 day pop of 11.81%. 

I actually was pretty tempted to play puts on Tesla due to this trend but I did want to wait out Monday. I am seeing a nice double top right at 185.2 resistance. However, with Tesla holding the daily 8ema and still holding that green support line I was more nervous to jump into puts. There is a chance this pop could last another day or two and we could see a test of the daily 20ema near 192.5 Monday or of the red falling wedge resistance at 190.1 Monday. However, unless Tesla opens green and holds 185.2 Monday then we should break support line and I will be looking at the next leg down. 

Historically speaking… we should look for about a 7day drop of 17.8%... so assuming that today was the top that means by December 6th we should look for a drop to about 152.2. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2r2rn16rt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f978f535ead6ae4cb9800b78ae1d3e72dc5361

Looking at Tesla falling wedge and the support line of that for December 6th that would give us a support bounce of about 150.6, however, if you look at this previous drop we did not touch the support line completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wmbbqjmrt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fbb644d301cbccbb44076501172bc8a532d386

Tesla weekly did break through the red bear channel resistance. This is the resistance if we use support from the October 3rd and 10th weekly candles and project it to the peak of the October 31st candle. However, there is also a blue bear channel using the peak of September 19th and October 31st candles. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h7nkv04st52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d18513a39dc8d9ff04be246612f0d1f6ed732b9

It would then make our weekly chart look like this. I personally put far more weight into the blue bear channel than I do the red bear channel. That would mean we actually did not break through resistance and have resistance pegged at that magical 185.3 level next week. If Tesla holds under that level all week then that is a rejection of the bear channel and should bring more down side. I am seeing a bullish reversal dragonfly doji candle formed here, however, we DID fail to close back over the daily 200ema. This daily 200ema next week could act as resistance and form a double top which would lead to further downside. 

Key support- 166.4 -&gt; 154.2

Key resistance- 192.9 -&gt; 207.2

The VIX is finally nearing that danger zone. That lower red highlighted channel of 19.7 to 16.5. Every time a “peak” on SPY has been put in the VIX has broken under 19.7 or touched it first. 

I am really eyeing a case of VIX touching 19.7 or below Monday or Tuesday this week with SPY rejecting 405-410 area and then come Wednesday through Friday we see a pretty large drop due to JPOW and the economic data coming out.

Another week of green here on the Challenge closing out with a net profit of $980 this week and total profits over the two weeks ive been running this challenge of $1740. 

**Daily log-**

Unfortunately I struggled this week quite a bit. However, my biggest losses came from once again holding too long. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cfisi5tut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20de760d00def936f1d3ec68e15ae7538cc88422

Looking at my weekly analysis here I actually impressively hit 100% win rate on all my SPY scalps this week. Had a pretty mild profit between the normal scalps/ $5k scalps of $1980 this week. I only scalped a total of 7 times this week with 3 of those coming from today. I just didn’t see a lot of good setups this week for scalps and struggled finding a good read on the technical earlier in the week. 

Looking at my level to level plays this is actually the first week I believe in about 7 weeks of playing level to level/ swings that I have close out my week red for strictly the level to level plays. The biggest mistake this week was my stop losses on those. I started the week off with a pretty large -50% loss on Tesla. It had popped from about -40% to -25% and then immediately to -50% before I could really do much on a massive drop. I also took a put on FOMC minute day to -78% that had I mitigated my loss properly at -20% or the -5% right before minutes I would have actually ended my week green. I as I had said was FAR too bearish for FOMC minutes (which I think come Wednesday when JPOW speaks im going to find out I was right but market didn’t react that way) and burnt myself. 

I also took a pretty large loss on a SPX call overnight last night. I have not seen the IV crush the way it did on SPX/ SPY overnight. I know we had the holiday and everything but for SPY opening barely down 0.1% I believe it was and for my strike being the first strike OTM I was extremely shocked to see my position open -65%. I was able to get out around -60% but that one hurt a lot. I don’t think anyone who played anything (unless they sold options) won with a swing today. 

Morale of the story is I let my losers run more than I let me winners run. This week I failed to properly mitigate my losses and that was a big mistake and one I will continue to learn from next week. 

Overall closing out the week at a total -$594 which is not bad in all reality but it is still my first red week since the week of September 12th. Looking to get back on a good track Monday and get back on that green gain train.

People don’t understand Tesla and they will be late one day. 

Unlike oil and gas which has upfront installation costs and ongoing drilling costs, the infrastructure in green energy only has installation costs (negligible maintenance costs for both).

What this means? Every solar, battery, supercharger Tesla or any green energy company installs produces near 0 cost energy.

For solar, wind into a battery, it’s near 0. For superchargers it’s grid cost.

So essentially this is one of the things that’ll print money for Tesla.

And what’s even more impressive, they can add 5cents per kWh and make more money.

This the amount of superchargers in North America alone:

Tesla rose 7.82%, its biggest daily gain since July, as Musk said he would expand cooperation with South Korea in the supply chain to procure $10 billion worth of components by 2023. Citi upgraded the stock and wrote in a note that “the year-to-date pullback has balanced out the near-term risk/reward.”

On the technical side, TSLA did make a price correction and went back to equilibrium area on the daily chart with increasing volume. The breakaway gap worked pretty well in the intraday price action and closed at high.

[**Deere (DE)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-DE/)

Deere closes up 5.03% after releasing the better-than-expected earnings reports. Net income rose to $2.25 billion from $1.28 billion a year earlier. Diluted EPS of $7.44, up from $4.12 a year ago and consensus of $7.10; Revenue rose 37.2% year over year to $15.54 billion, beating estimates of $13.46 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

After the breakaway gap on earning, DE formed a 30-min chart bull flag. With closing below the middle of the daily chart candlestick, over-extended on the daily chart, and the RSI indicator shows DE is overbought, it is reasonable to expect certain level of price correction on it.

Minutes from the Fed's November meeting showed that the central bank is making progress in fighting high inflation and wants to slow the pace of rate hikes, which would mean even smaller hikes by the end of this year and into 2023. As inflation seems to cool down a bit and Fed’s minutes show a potential slower hike, it is time to look for beaten-down stocks with solid cash flows.

FOMC minutes:

Overall when I read these highlights from the minutes honestly they kind of shock me a little bit. The overall message and the way the markets received these minutes was far more bullish (dovish) than JPOW presented himself at the last FOMC. The way JPOW presented stuff with saying that there was no reason to slow and that I was extremely pre-mature is not quite the same vibes im getting from these minutes and perhaps that’s why we did see a decent rally off of FOMC minutes here today. 

The biggest things im noting is that the fed does not believe inflation is under control and they also do no believe that they have reached peak fed funds (they don’t even know where its going to go). 

This could be enough to send markets bullish and to test the bull market resistance next week though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gydvsda5xr1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=677044b7ea1e8214bbee781a672215cb816c9dcb

While I do not believe in the bullish push and I do not believe that the markets should keep rallying this is where we have to take our bias and ignore it. I will be looking at calls and will remain bullish on SPY until I see the rising wedge break and see the daily 8ema support broken. Today reconfirmed we are bullish and not only that we closed over the daily 200ema for the first time since August. 

With earlier last week touching and holding the 390.1 support level I do look now for a touch of the purple bear channel resistance at 405.4.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2e4fy8r5xr1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1573d79045267f436d7216058814e487d79e6c8d

Looking at the weekly (remember markets closed tomorrow and Friday half day) we are seeing quite a nice setup here to touch the weekly 50ema at 403.6 Friday and possibly with a big enough push touch resistance at 408.7 (about 1.5% green day). I see forming here a double top at 408.7 where we close Friday at or near 408.7 followed by next week touching the bear market resistance at 409.8 that then results in this current peak being put in much like the last channel resistance peak at 432 in august. 

However, if we break through this bear market resistance (the dark green line) then things are going to get really really interesting. A break through that from a technical and algo stand point could be pretty explosive. And as I have mentioned through this whole bear market there needs to be a reason for bulls to want to sell. And for people to not want to buy in for the “rally.” At this point there is not much left until CPI and FOMC. 

But now we get to an interesting place with CPI and FOMC. Lets say CPI comes in bad and CPI yoy increases or just a generalized missed. Will markets even care? JPOW most likely does a 50bps anyways right? Or do we see an even bigger reaction then we would usually see as market panics about another 75bps… he did say he didn’t have a reason to slow remember? 

This market get harder and harder to trade every day especially the more the bullish “copium/ hopium” that is pumped into it.

Tesla is the stock that giveth and taketh. I am a little disappointed in myself for perfectly analyzing this move up and really even calling it to the day and not reaping the rewards of that play… I got blinded by FOMC minutes today for sure. I was so bearish cause of FOMC minutes and historically FOMC minutes opens red so I did not want to take Calls on tesla. Then we had such a huge pop on spy at open I even saw the 176 breakout and thought we would hit 180 and didn’t play it. I also regrettably played puts expecting the 180 level to continue to reject as it had and well that did not go well… I also missed played it as it came back to me and I failed to close it for a small loss. I was eying a drop here on FOMC minutes and that never came.

Tesla broke through two of the three falling wedges today and closed over its daily 8ema for the first time since November 1st, putting in its biggest day since July also.

We should look for the top of this rally to be put in on Monday or Tuesday and finish us somewhere near 185.2 to 186.8. I will look for the next time we touch the daily 20ema for the next opportunity for some puts. 

Support- 183.2 -&gt; 173.6

Highlighted here on the VIX you can see that the last 3 “tops” were put in when the VIX broke below that thick red line at 19.7. This is where I am eyeing for the VIX to hit Friday or early next week. 

My ideal case to finally grab some 30-60dte puts is the VIX to break under 19.7 (doesn’t have to close but would like it to) and SPY touching 405.3 to 409.5 next week. If we break out over 409.5 then I will be more worried about going long on puts as we may actually get a bigger unwind on the VIX and we COULD see a bigger push for SPY to 420-430 before CPI/ FOMC.

This still remains a terrible time here as going long on puts feels early and against trend but going long on calls feels like fomo/ chasing/ buying the top.

To be honest just kinda of have felt off my game the last two weeks. I put in my 2nd red day of the week today. I actually cant remember the last time ive had two red days in one week. Been a few months for sure. 

Just haven’t been able to get a good read on the market lately. But I also evaluated myself today and I do feel I was today too bearish. Earlier in the week I was just getting caught by the choppy range and tight range with failure to follow through but today I was a bear and couldn’t get on the other side of the aisle. 

Some days we win some and some days we lose some. Some weeks we win some some weeks we win some… its impractical to expect anyone (im saying this to myself too) to be perfect. Its actually highly impractical to expect to have a green day or a green week every week. Considering I believe I have only had 4 red days now in the last 3 months isn’t too bad. But I hold myself to a higher standard. 

I for one look forward to the next day off and a half day on Friday before the weekend to reboot and get back in a good place. 

I am thankful for each and every one of you and I hope we continue to be thankful for the ability to do what we do each day.

While the market shat on BB post the IVY frenzy the Chenster and his posse have been busy. 

Cyber is going to stabilize in next 2 quarters (see Chen interview at ICE). We prob wont see explosive growth but we dont need that right now. 

What we need is QNX growth and that is what we are going to get that per the TD investor conference yesterday:

1) QNX is on fire. Design wins are progressing at fastest speed. First 6 months generated highest number of design wins as the prior 12 months. 

2) Record number of developer seats deployed. That means preproduction design revenues are growing as evidenced by backlog going from 490 to 560. 

3) QNX Revenues on track to hit 15 percent yoy growth. The 200-215 range is secured. 

4) Slowing economy does not affect pace of QNX design wins. Auto OEMs are transitioning to modern car architecture and they have no choice but to integrate QNX. 

5) BMW highlighted as key customer win. No car OEM wants to build their own core operating system software. Its too hard and not a differentiator. It all goes to BB. Tesla is outlier. But BB thinks they can help Elon FYI.

6) ASP per QNX deployment not something they will disclose. But per car there are larger number of use cases for QNX. So on per car basis the Revenue per car is increasing. Example a high tech BMW will utilize multiple QNX deployments. 

Want a bonus catalyst? Ivy on track. Expect first big announcement at CES in january. Check out CES speakers. BMW chairman is one of the key speakers and BB just signed a big QNX deal with them.

74,1669219017,z2spxc,1,"Tesla shares have shed more than $700 billion in market value since peaking in early November of last year, but analysts now suggest the carmaker is poised for a comeback.

Tesla  (**TSLA**) shares moved firmly higher Wednesday after analysts at Citigroup lifted their rating on the clean-energy carmaker while Morgan Stanley noted that the stock's $500 billion slump maybe coming to an end.

Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli lifted his rating on Tesla to 'neutral' from 'sell', while boosting his price target by around $35 to $176 per share, arguing the stock's year-to-date decline of around 58% has ""balanced out the near-term risk/reward"" for Tesla investors.

""To be sure, macro/competitive concerns are likely to remain an overhang with capacity rising, but as we’ve previously written, in a hard landing scenario Tesla’s long-term competitive position likely also improves and potentially further enhanced by (President Joe Biden's inflation reduction act),"" Michaeli wrote. 

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, meanwhile, said Tesla shares are ""approaching our $150 bear case, driven by price cuts in China, decelerating EV demand and other market currents."" 

Jonas, who carries an 'overweight' rating with a $330 price target on Tesla stock, said that while the ongoing distraction of CEO Elon Musk's foray into Twitter will likely expose investors to added risks, the group remains on pace to grow sales by around 37% next year, generate $15 billion in free-cash-flow and consolidate its position as the word's dominant EV player.

""We believe Tesla's 'gap-to-competition' can potentially widen, particularly as EV prices pivot from inflationary to deflationary,"" Jonas wrote. ""With respect to the (inflation reduction act) we believe Tesla is by far the best positioned OEM in terms of potential eligibility for consumer tax and production credits.""

75,1669215733,z2rcpj,1,"U.S. stocks rose slightly Wednesday morning, as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve meeting minutes for clues into the pace of future interest rate hikes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44 points, or 0.13%. The S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.11%.

Shares of Nordstrom fell more than 8% in the premarket after the department store chain reaffirmed its forecast. However, Nordstrom beat profit and sales expectations in its latest results, according to consensus expectations on Refinitiv. Tesla rose 2.6% in early trading after Citi upgraded shares to neutral from sell.

Jobless claims data came in higher than expected at 240,000 for the week ending Nov. 19 where economist expected 225,000, signaling that the labor market may be weakening. At the same time, however, durable goods orders for October were stronger than anticipated, coming in at 1%, more than the 0.5% expected.

Investors are awaiting the latest Fed meeting minutes, due Wednesday afternoon, for insight into the central bank’s approach on monetary policy ahead of the December meeting.

Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008. Economists are forecasting a half percentage point increase in December, and smaller rate hikes next year.

Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.

Investors shrugged off fears of further lockdowns in China after the country reported its first Covid deaths since May. Instead, traders focused on some strong earnings reports, and bet on the likelihood for an easing in monetary policy from the Fed going forward.

“Investor psychology remaining optimistic is driving the rally in this market,” Eugene Profit, CEO at Profit Investments, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”

“Going into the next Fed meeting, I think the Fed will probably moderate their language a little bit, and I think investors want to remain optimistic, and ignore a lot of headwinds in this market,” he added.

Markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will close early on Friday.

Looks like VOLD was behaving nicely today and overall the technical were pretty solid. Kinda sad I missed today but in the end family is always over money/ trading. 

Tomorrow we get FOMC minutes and while its not guaranteed a big mover or big day this one with the fed pivot narrative and deciding what rate hike for next meeting could bring some good movement.

Quite a lot going on today technical wise. We did confirm that daily 8ema as support once again and if you remember I had suspected with the doji candle and closure over that key 394.7 support that we would see a bounce today. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i03j7jnjel1a1.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0b420fbf1bd2fee7d7535d183b65d11c8e02c2

My 0dte calls paid out nicely and made it worth missing the whole day today. 

Now today we see that we did break through that diamond pattern on SPY daily. This should open us up to some more upside and we also closed over that key 398.5 resistance. The next major support is 401.2 followed by 405.4. With FOMC minutes tomorrow and a lot of fed speakers I really don’t expect much bullish movement and the minutes are going to reconfirm just how hawkish jpow is right now. The keys level we need to watch is 398.5 and 401.2 tomorrow. Those will be our gateways. Also if we do close over 401.2 then we would be closing over the daily 200ema and that really would be a bullish sign. 

At this point there isn’t a big reason to short SPY until we close back under the daily 8ema. But again as I have said going long (think 30-60dte) here also seems like FOMO and chasing. Best thing to do here is to pay the short term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Futures also broke its diamond pattern but instead of showing you that again here I am going to show you this rising wedge that is on futures and SPYs daily chart. This is very key to watch and could lead us to a touch of the 2022 bear market resistance line (the thicker green line) and this could be the pattern to watch to show the next leg down. 

With a closure over 4000 now and breaking the 3955 to 4000 consolidation period we naturally will be looking for the upside here. Key resistance is the daily 200ema at 4028 followed by 4060 and 4090. Key support is now 4010 and 3955. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla did make a new low today despite closing green. I posted some analyzed data on tesla with its drops and pops so lets update these now and see what they show…

I want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… 

Sept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   
 Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  
 Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  
 Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  
 Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   
 Nov 15th (current drop)= 7 day drop -17.2% followed by a ????  
 

Average # of days for the drop= 6.8 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  
 Average % for the drop= -17.8% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  
 Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  
 Average % for the pop= 11.81%  
 

so what does this tell us? 

With todays new low we are now at day 7 of dropping and -17.2%. We are right at the average length of the drops before we see some upside. 

This also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 166.19 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 185.82 by Tuesday that 29th. 

Looking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. 

So again all this show us is that Tesla is following the cycle. With FOMC minutes tomorrow though that could be a wild card but I overall expect some upside on tesla the rest of the week. 

Overall 168 to 170 has now built itself as a nice support area here and we could see a push back up tomorrow to test that blue falling wedge resistance at 170. So unless tesla opens red tomorrow and never sees green it will break that blue falling wedge resistance which should provide a push up to at least 175-180. 

However, if Tesla loses 168 tomorrow then I will be looking for 162.5 which is the red falling wedge support line.

The VIX is still on a mission to break back into the teens it appears. I am a little surprised to not see a slight move up on the VIX today with FOMC minutes tomorrow but perhaps that comes in the morning which does seem to be the trend lately. The VIX also gap filled the August 19th 21.27 gap now (well it hit a low of 21.28 today which is one penny from being gap filled). With the VIX touching 21.3 and dumping even further away form its daily 8ema I would be eyeing 19.7 next which is where the VIX hit in August before the “top” was put in and we started our next leg down. 

**Daily log-**

Being that I was gone all day and had a nice win on my SPY calls I decided not to even attempt to trade anything in the morning before I left.

Overall a green day today and this green day turned my week back to a green week which is always nice. Wish I woulda held onto those tesla calls a little longer in the morning but after yesterdays $3 drop in one second that put me deep red I wasn’t gonna take a chance.

Ryan Cohen is a genuinely good human being - and definitely not a liar. 

That is why he wont say that GME will be successful, he wont say it because he knows it would be a lie.

 Other CEOs with less scruples like Elon will say things like this:

# Elon Musk Said In 2015 Tesla Could Be Worth $700 Billion In 2025 — Was 5 Years Early

I am so grateful for Ryan Cohen, he is like a sexy little jungle Panda - and I know he will do the right thing and play everything safe ensuring that GME has some marginal gains after remaining relatively flat for a few years. Hey, the stock price may not appreciate at all. 

Ryan Cohen is honest and if he doesn't have anything positive to say its probably because there is nothing positive. I appreciate that he does not want to be a ""meme stock king""

Ryan is a straight shooter - a man who loves dogs and children books. With Ryan you see what you get. That's why I don't appreciate people putting words in his mouth and insinuating that he is tweeting cryptic messages - RY-DOG don't play that. 

My opinion is that a lot has changed in the last year and Ryan doesn't have any answers regarding the future of GME and that is why he remains silent.

As one person offering a perspective - I would wait for Ryan to actually say something viable and exciting before getting excited yourself.

Take a look at the Netflix ticker or Disney's losses in the streaming sector and it should be obvious to everyone that streaming services require more than ho-hum original content to survive. 

Disney made the mistake of thinking that because people like Disney content, they'll pay for a DVD player that only plays Disney content. A large number of people will, but making and maintaining that line of DVD players isn't easy or free.

4. Political BS

This is where things continue to perplex me and I continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say. Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. 

So we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. 

This next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard.

Last week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. 

The bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. 

We closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. 

The issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. 

Bears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. 

Key support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1

Key resistance-398.5 -&gt; 401.3

Futures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b4woaa4ipd1a1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56818a1864ada48fd356d989717ecd5cbe37bdb6

I removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n4dh1vnipd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7488b50427a19e5bfa3253f3bf0b131cbce538fb

Out of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. 

Back to futures now.   
 key support- 3960 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3910  
 key resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4028

Zooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy86mnojpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5225f763631b55f413c3dd6bc3e2cb95122ac2fe

Now looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. 

Interestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. 

This is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? 

I want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… 

Sept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   
 Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  
 Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  
 Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  
 Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   
 Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  
 

Average # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  
 Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  
 Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  
 Average % for the pop= 11.81%  
 

so what does this tell us? 

Well being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. 

This also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. 

Looking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… 

Lets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. 

That means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. 

To be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks.

Really tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. 

From there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. 

A red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. 

HOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… 

Anyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. 

People really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. 

Long story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!

**""After spending a year strengthening our assortment, infrastructure, and tech capabilities, we're now focused on achieving profitability, launching proprietary products, leveraging our brand in new ways, and investing in our stores,""**

I'm not going to cover everything we already know about the above( increased product offerings immensely, two new distribution centers, new GME branded products, stock options for employees etc)

For the first time in 3 years GME's foot traffic is higher than pre pandemic ( as of October), and with the release of God of War, MW2, Pokemon Scarlett, increased PS5 inventory 400% YoY etc , and many others this coming Q4 is looking pretty good( also notably GME's best cyclically quarter because of the holidays) . See below:

GME started a brand new offer new offering for its Pro member's recently; spend $200 and get a free NFT on their marketplace. Now before you blast this as some sort of gimmick; keep reading....

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xbtg3kv1lb1a1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78af7ad6453271e2724cc8f18818a7b2e3c09b6a

&amp;#x200B;

GME not too long ago air dropped( sent out a free NFT) to the first 5000 users of their NFT marketplace. Those users received an NFT pin

80+ ETH in trading volume currently, 650 ish sales, ranging from .245 to .09 ETH( $300 to $100 USD roughly). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4oyty0m2hb1a1.jpg?width=404&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c21a6c7bbc6c42ef1a5b3898018ba92d93c26f55

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know about you, but even my 6 year old son told me to buy $200 from GME, as it could potentially be 100% free in the end. Either way there is a chance for a decent size discount, as there is a large GME community that can't get in on the original promo( people overseas without local stores, or those who simply missed it etc). Also there are a lot of crypto speculators too. I've personally made 700% on my 7K investment into the GME marketplace so its definitely a place where you can make money.

I believe GME will use this same incentive structure to gain more market dominance in both the video game &amp; collectable industry. For example if GME convinces Sony to sign up at their marketplace and offer an NFT collection, GME could bundle this collection as free incentive to those who purchase a God of War PS5 bundle through GME. This would give GME a huge edge over other competitors. Sony would be incentivized to become a creator here, as they would make a royalty on every NFT sale, and they already have a fleet of digital image designers etc, so it would take very little leg work. Furthermore, and more importantly Sony would then have access to every secondary customer's wallet address, and be able to offer direct coupons or other incentives to those secondary customer that they might never have contact with. It could reel in a lot more business for Sony. I was NEVER into crypto or NFTs before GME for example. A lot of people simply will want to collect these Sony NFTS outside of monetary gains too. I have 150+ now, and some are just neat to have, just like all my Marvel cards when I was a kid in the 80/90s. I make lot of money, so its peanuts to me. My wife has 100K worth of american girl stuff, don't under estimate people's willingness to collect stuff; its human nature. Don't forget GME also gets a cut of each NFT transaction too, a double dip here on top of the original PS5 bundle sale.

Once other businesses take note of this, many more will start reaching out to GME, and I believe GME will start basically selling their NFT marketplace services to other industries; just like they did with the Saw Movie Game . 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eu2sgpxwkb1a1.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c109b96cc3990ca8d6d2988edf0dcbee9bbc0fa7

&amp;#x200B;

It will then more importantly cross link with their marketplace, like IMX is doing with their video game NFT customers( video game developers). A centralized hub that will increase the liquidity drastically( necessary for an type of exchange to operate, and be profitable). GME has the customer basis for this, as they have noted is one of their largest assets.

Speaking of IMX, they have now finally integrated with the GME NFT marketplace.

&amp;#x200B;

5 million worth of trades in the first week with only 6 game collections

The owner of IMX mentions, ""

""More than half of these logos didn't exist 3 months ago. Immutable is onboarding web3 games at a record pace in the middle of a bear market. ""

All of these games will be going on to the GME marketplace. IIRC something like 1000+ games are in the works.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/thkmbf59hb1a1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4e66b3cb7fc4a6df7c16891ef4ebcb211314b69

I am sure out of 1000+ there will be something for every type of gamer. Furthering GME's bottom line, some of the NFT collections are cross useable between platforms, incentivizing even more trading.

Cyber Crew and many other GME NFT collections are now doing this.

All of this combined with reducing store leases( 4573 down to 2963), and closing all stores in Switzerland in Q1 2023( so not yet), I expect GME to become profitable in the next 6 to 12 months.

In 3 ish more weeks we will know more on their Q3 earnings call. If they have reduced their cash burn rate from finishing their tech investments, its going to start to get spicy. Consecutive profitable earnings would be a first in 3 years I believe, and if all of the above works out; I foresee a lot of institutional buy ins. With the float mostly owned by retail who will not sell( as proven by DRS 8-k sec filings) the 2 year chart will finally reverse; just like it did for Tesla.","GME is closing in on becoming a profitable company, and the 2 year chart will start reversing",1.0,2022-11-21 15:08:46

But every time I checked into the market today it looked like an absolute brutal tight range. We spent the first 45 minutes stuck in a $1.56 range. And the first 2.25 hours stuck in the same $2.06 range. These tight ranges unfortunately are becoming the norm in this market. I am seeing more and more days of 930 am till about noon tight consolidation ranges that lead to power hour breakouts/ break downs.

Despite the extremely bloody open today we managed with the mid afternoon breakout to close the gap from pre market so now the only gap we have is 381.14 to 385.64 from CPI and another gap at 403.1 to 408.46 from September CPI. As much as gaps “always fill” there is no time frame in 2022 for gap fills. 

The biggest bull case from today that I am seeing is that we broke all the way down to key level support at 390 which is also the 100ema and put in very nice consolidation there this morning to re-establish it as support before we pushed back up. With this 390 support bounce I will be looking for a move back to retest the 200ema. After CPI with that massive move up in a short period of time this could be the cool off/ reset before we push higher. 

However, on a bearish case we could show that after testing the 200ema and rejecting this is the beginning of the sell off which puts in the “top” of this current bear market rally. Quite a few of these rallies during the 2022 bear market have ended at major EMAs and the 200ema after trading under it since end of August is definitely a major resistance level.

Taking a look at futures daily actually shows a more bullish set up to me. Im seeing that same 3910 support bounce and reconfirmation on futes at the 100ema. However, this daily candle actually shows a more bullish reversal with this long wicked dragonfly doji. 

I would have liked to seen this get back over 3963, however, 3950 is a previous key level and we may re-establish that level here with this daily futes candle closing. We didn’t quite close on 3950 but back at that key level. The daily 8ema on futes did hold nicely today.

Tesla continues to trade within a falling wedge withing a falling wedge withing a downward channel. 

With yesterdays daily 8ema rejection followed by todays making a lower low and failing to break yesterdays HOD I am looking for a push lower. The issue with this and the reason I didn’t short Tesla overnight is that im bullish on SPY (tomorrow) and that makes me bullish at least at open on Tesla. OF course we have seen time and time again tesla does what ever it wants but that generally is related to a news dump. 

Looking strictly at Tesla technical I see a case for a retest of support at 177.4 tomorrow. However, we could see this 183.2 support with a doji candle turn into support and push us up tomorrow. 

Key support- 183.2 -&gt; 177.4

The VIX today held over that key 23.5 level however once again rejected the daily 8ema resistance. It does appear we did just barely poked our the wick through that blue support line today. 

With that support break through and the back to back gravestone dojis I do forsee the VIX to retest 23.5 support tomorrow and possibly break through it. However, we have a lot of options expiring tomorrow.

I was gone with my son on his field trip all day today so I wasn’t able to trade much today. However, I took a quick scalp EOD. 

I did decide to swing some 5dte SPY calls over night. With that major 390 support bounce today and the EOD push up with the VIX unwinding more I like the risk to reward of pushing up tomorrow to retest that key 395 to 398 range. 

I didn’t wanna play 1dte (0dte at open) overnight because we have had so much crazy volatility and really unpredictability pre market/ after hours and being opex like that I didn’t feel comfortable with a shorter dte.

This looks like a classic abandoned baby bear pattern. That would indicate there is more downside to go tomorrow. However, zoomed out I do see a potential bull flag forming here also. The last 4 days most of the trading was spend between 395 and 398.5. We really need to see a clean break under or over these levels to have a nice sense of direction. 

We failed outreach the daily 200ema again today but despite the heavy sell volume we managed to hold 395 support very well. I don’t particularly have an opinion on where we are going tomorrow and for that reason I did sit cash overnight.

Tesla had broken out of its falling wedge yesterday only to now find itself back inside yet again another falling wedge. With that nice daily 8ema rejection and double top off 196.1 yesterday I did take some overnight puts slightly OTM on Tesla and boy did they print at open! I unfortunately did close a little early but I like to take profits. Tesla especially has a way of moving like wild fire at open where you don’t know if its about to rip $4 green or $4 red. I have found with Tesla if I am correct its best to secure profits immediately at open and if im wrong its best to wait on the first 30 minutes.

Looking at Tesla daily today we now have yet again another falling wedge formed but more importantly than that we did break through that 5 day long blue support line. This should open up some more downside for Tesla here now. 187.66 is currently the weekly 200ema on tesla which we now are back under neath. I was watching this level very closely last week and as I had mentioned last week a closure under this should open up a lot more downside.

I don’t ever include a 15min chart on the VIX but I just had to show how flat it really was today. Between the bold vertical purple lines is the intraday open to close. The vix held an impressively tight $1.73 cent range all day long. Im not sure if people are still on edge about the Poland/ Russia stuff and are unwilling to take their put hedges off or if we have just reached a point where no one is putting downside protection on but the fear isn’t ready to continue to unwind out of the market. 

Overall though we are clearly still holding that 23.5 level where I struggle to be bullish shorter term/ longer term until we unwind under neath that.

**Daily Log-** 

Today was a really tough day to trade and I got stopped out and stopped myself out a few times only to go green. I also was the lucky part for a few rogue candle spikes in my favor too. A green day but not my best day that’s for sure.

This week has been pretty interesting for me. I haven’t really been doing it on purpose per say but I have found that I have take a major risk off on Scalps this week. I have only scalped a total of 9 times this whole week (about 3/ day). However, in the last month or so I have been averaging 5-10 scalps/ day. I also have seen a major uptick in my level to level plays now fronting about 8-10/ day when over the last month I have at best done 2-4 a day. 

Overall I would say win rate and profits have been consistent with this change. I still believe we are in a scalpers market but I have really been enjoying these level to level plays. While I find that humbly I am good at scalps and good at recognizing high probability set ups. IT has been a really nice change of pace to be able to open a play and let it play out without having to have my finger on sell the whole time and without being worried about one small pop stopping me out only for it to come back to my favor. 

Something to keep in mind in my level to level plays and really in any strategy you deploy in this market is the risk to reward. I am not perfect and it would be practical to have a 100% win rate all the time… yes at times I have done it for short periods of times but its improbable to expect it. What we need to focus on is high probability and high risk to reward set ups. So this means we have to be willing to go into a position that COULD stop us out at out -20%. But the risk to reward and probability of green is high enough that the reward out weighs the risk. It is also important in this market to use stop losses. 

Most importantly though it is important to be mechanical in those stop losses. The second you remove that stop loss “to let it play out” you already loss. You loss because you broke your rules in an attempt of being smarter than the market. 

Stay mechanical. Take the high probability plays. Don’t be afraid to take 3-5% if that means green. If you see it going against you… we don’t have to let it play all the way to the stop loss.

Today we saw yet again another massive sell off. I am trying to decide if markets are truly that over extended that anything will cause a dump or if we are just getting truly rogue new waves causing a dump. The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now… it sure shows signs it doesn’t want to stay there.

The one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland “incident” is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. 

Now SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is… did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.

Looking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. 

Futures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965.

Tesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation.

We did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn’t take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren’t that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC. 

There still is a very real scenario where JPOW says 50 bps hike and hints at another 50bps next meeting in January. On top of that there is nothing saying after 5 consecutive decreases on the CPI YoY readings that we don’t get a rogue spike in CPI YoY that sends the markets tumbling. At this point with the markets now expecting a beat on CPI any miss is going to get bloody… like historically bloody type of days…

I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don’t enjoy trading much and I also don’t trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play. So I was mostly cash. Still a green day but small at that…

I am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don’t know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn’t even a missile… we probably will never know the truth. 

I did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. 

That’s the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of “are you going to take profits at open?” “you going to take your loss at open?” and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn’t about to play out.

**The Canadian government provides a list of 70 projects**   
The United States military has quietly solicited applications for Canadian mining projects that want American public funding through a major national security initiative. It's part of an increasingly urgent priority of the U.S. government: lessening dependence on China for critical minerals that are vital in everything from civilian goods such as electronics, cars and batteries, to weapons.  
It illustrates how Canadian mining is becoming the nexus of a colossal geopolitical struggle. Ottawa just pushed [Chinese state-owned companies](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-critical-minerals-plan-1.6634386) out of the sector, and the U.S. is now considering moving public funding in.  
The American military has a new pot of money at its disposal to help private companies inaugurate new mining projects; it's for funding feasibility studies, plant renovations, battery-recycling and worker training.   
President Joe Biden invoked the 1950 [Defense Production Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2989973/defense-production-act-title-iii-presidential-determination-for-critical-materi/) to expand the domestic mining sector, and the military received [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/climate-bill-canada-minerals-1.6551920) to implement it. This whirlwind of activity was prompted by a [White House study](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf) last year warning that dependence on certain foreign-made products represents a national security risk to the U.S., and it cited semiconductors, batteries, medicines and 53 types of minerals including **graphite**. [Read More](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends/79e1ed40-64eb-11ed-b7c5-8e0d74f3ac48/preview)....   
**Why Graphite is Important**  


Despite boasting a large EV market, the US does not produce any natural graphite and must rely solely on imports to satisfy domestic demand. The level of foreign dependence has increased over the years, with the US importing 38,900 tonnes of graphite in 2016, followed by 70,700 tonnes in 2018. According to the USGS, in 2020 the US imported 42,000 tonnes, of which 71% was high-purity flake graphite, 28% was amorphous, and 1% was lump and chip graphite. The top importers were China (33%), Mexico (23%), Canada (17%) and India (9%).  


But remember, the US is not 33% dependent on China for its battery-grade graphite, but 100%, since China controls all the spherical graphite processing. Such a level of dependence can be considered both unsustainable and uneconomical. It’s also important to consider the environmental ramifications of persisting with China as the go-to graphite source. Coal still dominates China’s energy mix, meaning the carbon footprint of all products, including synthetic graphite, is quite high.  


One study found that producing 1 kg of synthetic graphite releases 4.9 kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, whereas for natural graphite the CO2 emission is 1-2 kg. Synthetic graphite currently accounts for 58% of the anode material market share, but its environmental footprint means that the industry is expected to gradually shift towards natural graphite.   
Lomiko is developing a graphite mine in Quebec where recently, a company with a similar deposit has recently received funding from Panasonic and Mitsui, groups involved in battery-making operations for Tesla. [ Read More....](https://nmg.com/panasonic-offtake/)

**Canadian Government Announces the Fast-tracking of Mineral Projects**  
Canada will have to fast-track energy and mining projects if it is to help its democratic allies and achieve its own net-zero ambitions, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a speech this week in Washington — the most tangible signal to date that the federal Liberal government is prepared to address regulatory hurdles that have hampered economic development in this country for years.

**Lomiko's Discovers** **Motherlode** **of Graphite**  
Lomiko Metals Inc. (TSX.V: LMR) (“Lomiko Metals” or the “Company”) announcedcompletion of drilling and analytical results from the infill and extension exploration drill program at its wholly-owned La Loutre Graphite property, located approximately 180 kilometres northwest of Montréal in the Laurentian region of Québec.  
Belinda Labatte, CEO and Director stated: “I am happy to see that the results from the last eleven holes drilled on EV zone in 2022 are in line with the results we announced in previous press releases. These results show significant mineralization over large intervals, including LL-22-044 with 7.60% Cg over 119.8m from 81.2 to 201m, consistent with previous results. The wide intervals encountered in 8 of the 11 holes further validate the continuity and the quality of the mineralization in the EV zone. We look forward to receiving the results from the 26 holes completed over the Battery Zone in August and September.”  
**Highlights**  
Intersecting high-grade graphite values and significant widths  
8 out of 9 (11 holes total) intersected significant mineralization with two holes abandoned and redrilled due to challenging environmental conditions  
**Up to 7.60% Cg over 119.8m from 81.2 to 201m in hole LL-22-044 including 10.06% Cg over 40.5m from 81.2m to 121.7m and 10.31% Cg over 19.5m from 166.7 to 186.2m**  
**Hole LL-22-045 encountered 5.83% Cg over 27m from 204.0 to 231.0m including 19.5 meters at 7.63% Cg from 211.5 to 231.0m at 7.63% Cg**  
**Hole LL-22-050 encountered 5.07% Cg over 123.0 m from 13.0 to 136.0m including 14.5% Cg over 22.5m from 14.5 to 37.0m**  
**Holes LL-22-044, LL-22-045, LL-22-046, LL-22-049, LL-22-051 and LL-22-052 all bottomed in mineralization**  
Graphite intervals in 8 of 9 holes remain open; additional assay results pending  
The La Loutre graphite project site is located within the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg (KZA) First Nations territory. The drilling was supervised by Québec-based, independent geological consultant Breakaway Exploration Management Inc. and was operated under ECOLOGO requirements and compliance protocols, as Lomiko is ECOLOGO certified. Please see the press release issued on March 22, 2022 for more details about Lomiko’s ECOLOGO certification.  
The drill program at La Loutre was initiated on May 15, 2022, with the goal to further define the deposit, provide the data needed to increase confidence in the mineral resource and build on the results of the positive Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for the La Loutre project as announced in the Company’s July 29, 2021, press release. Lomiko has retained InnovExplo Inc, a Quebec-based independent consulting firm specializing in geology, resource estimation, mining engineering and sustainable development, to prepare an updated NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the La Loutre project following the completion of the 2022 drill program. The assay results reported in this press release are for eleven holes drilled at the central section of the EV Zone. These holes were drilled to confirm results of the previous drilling and provide better detail of the EV Zone in this part of the deposit. Please refer to Table 1 for the weighted average graphitic carbon-bearing drill intersections (not true thickness) and Table 2 and Figure 1 for the collar locations referred to in this press release.  
Significant intervals of graphite mineralization were intersected in 8 of the 11 holes. The best intersection was 7.60 percent graphitic carbon (“% Cg”) over 119.8 metres (“m”) from 81.2 to 201m in hole LL-22-044 including 10.06% Cg over 40.5m from 81.2m to 121.7m. Graphite intervals intersections in holes LL-22-45, -046, -047 and -050 remain open with additional assay results pending. Holes LL-22-044, -045, -046, -049, -051, -052 all bottomed in mineralization. Four other holes were planned for this area but could not be drilled due to difficult terrain or ground being too swampy, or soft conditions that prevented access.

SPY went on a super impressive breakout back to 400 only to get absolutely smacked down. This was actually a super bearish close today and shows a local top in my opinion. It will take some big strength to push through 400 that is for sure. 

With this black bull channel we actually have a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow. Not sure exactly how low we will go but until we can break through and close over 400 there is not a reason to expect further upside. 

Key support- 393.1 -&gt; 390.1 (key level support) 

Key resistance- 398.6 -&gt; 402

Identical pattern on futures right now too… we actually came close enough on Futures to the daily 200ema to call that a daily 200ema rejection and again with these gravestone doji candles I expect this to be the local top and to see a back test of some stronger support levels like 390/ 3905 before we have a fighting chance of continuing up. 

Support- 3925 -&gt; 3905 -&gt; 3863

Resistance- 4028 -&gt; 4060

&amp;#x200B;

Apple ran right into its daily 100ema today, however, found itself running into a brick wall and has now retraced pretty significantly. As I had mentioned last week this 100/200ema interaction on Apple is going to take some time and would be more then shock to shoot straight through. However, we could hard reject and retrace instead. 

Support- 146.9 -&gt; 145 -&gt; 141.3

Resistance- 149 -&gt; 150.5 -&gt; 153.5

Tesla attempted once again to break out over its daily ema and break out of this falling wedge on the daily however was once again unsuccessful. I had said last week that the 196.1 double top was in play and it sure was today. With this doji I do expect some downside tomorrow. IT did however find itself holding key support of 190.9 EOD. I will look for that support to break tomorrow and test the blue support line at 188. If we lose that support I am looking for 177.4 support retest this week. However, if we can hold support and finally take out the daily 8ema and 196.1 then we can look for the gap fill and possibly a bigger push towards 208.8 resistance. 

Support- 185.9 -&gt; 177.4

Resistance- 196.1 -&gt; 201.9 -&gt; 204.9

Lots of movement on the VIX today. Had a nice 6% green open that led to a hard sell off under that key 23.5 range. However, still not exactly sure what caused it but EOD we had a pretty big spike of the VIX that put it back over 23.5 and caused it to close its biggest green day since October 6th.

Now speaking about Tesla, I think this Insulin Eli Lilly fake account thing in twitter will have a correlation issue   [https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-dives-taking-novo-sanofi-with-it-after-fake-twitter-account-promises-free-insulin/)  Will lead to a freaking huge lawsuit against Elon's groups and team. The One key part of that legal landscape is **Section 230**, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content ( right from google search ) clearly states immunity. Here is the problem, someone was able to buy the blue check mark, without the quality control of the past, it's not so clear cut anymore. That's my new line of research. maybe a good long term put but the cost seems so high do to volatility that there is no meat on the bone. 

Your views are welcomed

160,1668211338,ysrao5,1,"*Short term noise*

A stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. 

*”DD”*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

Lets start with the FG index which I did talk about earlier this week on Monday we were only at 61 and we have now jumped up to 66. As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. 

I wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. 

January the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  
 April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   
 August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.

That means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at 401.6 and find out rejection point there. This actually is exactly where we rejected in august on the dead cat bounce. 

This COULD give us a trajectory of about 339.4 sometime between December 1st and December 20th. However, my one caveat here is the million dollar question “what would the catalyst for such a drop be?” Earnings is over, no cpi/ fomc until December 13th/ 14th and more or less there isn’t much I can for see that could panic people enough to sell that intensely. 

So if we break the trend and we let the FG index run hotter than usual the next question is “where are we going? How high are we going to go?”

Looking at the daily chart I see a bull and a bear case. Bull case would be that we push minimally to the 200ema at 401.6. If we can CLOSE a daily candle over that 200ema then I have no doubt next week we could test 405.4 channel resistance and we very well could end up testing that bigger solid green resistance line for the overall 2022 bear channel. This resistance on Friday is 410.8. 

However, if we either reject the 200ema or from here here double top and see downside the first stop is going to be 390. This is the level that bulls need to defend. If they lose 390 then we are looking at a pretty convincing minimally partial gap fill to 381.14. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rkrafse8iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf2c3a225eaf8f4605823c4dae5e1717f1881da

Now if we flip over to the weekly view things become a little more clear. We dead stopped into the weekly 100ema today and couldn’t break through that. We have a nice blue bull channel formed here and a pretty mild black rising wedge also. 

Next weeks key resistance comes in at 399.5. This will be our pivot point. Break out over it and hold that as support through the week and we are looking at a test of the WEEKLY bear channel resistance at 412.7 next week. However, if we reject and form a double top here at the weekly 100ema we could be looking for that backtest of 390. Same with the daily if we lose 390 then we will look for a bigger retrace. 

I am pretty indifferent here in the fact that I don’t see a catalyst to make people want to sell at these levels. Most investors are probs thinking “bottoms in” and they don’t wanna miss the next bull run. It will take a lot to convince them to sell. However, Spy just put its greenest week in since the week of June 21st. There definitely could be at minimum some profit taking and with the VIX unwinding we could see some people start hedging for next CPI/ FOMC. 

For me I wouldn’t take a long here but I feel until we touch the 200ema its too early to start a put position.  

Key support- 390 -&gt; 375.8

Key resistance- 399.5 -&gt; 409

Similar case here on the Futures daily we haven’t quite touched that key 200ema yet which is the gateway for the next big run up or the potential for the next top.

When we look at futures weekly chart you can see this is actually a true weekly bullish engulfing candle. This should provide some upside for next week from a technical standpoint. However, we need to take out that weekly 100ema first. We are also well above that 3870 JPM collar call too. 

Support- 3915 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705

Resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4085 -&gt; 4152 (bear market resistance… 3.8% from close)

Apple put that 135 support in this week and from here this thing has never looked back. I believe it will test that bear channel resistance next week. Apple fell just short of its 100ema and 200ema this week which as I have mentioned before on Apple is always a period of consolidation. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weekly on Apple actually is still trading within an overall bear channel. That resistance comes in at 151.9 next week. If we see Apple break through that level then it has broken its bear channel and we can look for further upside. Apple did close back over its 8ema but fell just short of its 20/50ema. 

Key support- 147.2 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2

Tesla mostly due to its sporadic movement the last few weeks has quite a few things set up on it. It has the bigger red falling wedge formed on it that has a tighter falling wedge with that black resistance line within it. There is also a potential recovery support line highlighted in blue. 

Tesla did come up today and get near the daily 8ema but failed to close over it today it also came within 14 cents from the November 7th 196.66 gap fill. I am keeping an eye out for a double top Monday at the daily 8ema which also would coincide with the back resistance line at 196.8. As long as we hold under that resistance line there should be downside expected. However, once we break through that resistance then I would expect a test of possibly the daily 20ema (especially if the markets remain bullish). 

&amp;#x200B;

I actually remain bearish on tesla, however, looking at the weekly it broke under the weekly 200ema as I had said for the first time in 3 years, however, it popped and closed over it. With this huge hanging man candle here there actually is a pretty solid case for upside next week. The weekly bear channel resistance will be 211.1 and will also be the weekly 8ema. 

Key support- 195.8 -&gt; 177.8 -&gt; 167.9

The VIX has now closed below 23.5 support for the first time since the days before the September CPI reading. This also is the lowest reading the VIX has closed at since August 26th which was Jackson Hole. 

This kinda goes even further to prove my point that I don’t see a bearish catalyst for this market. IF we look at the last two times the VIX was at these levels there was bearish catalysts that pushed it back up. Jackson hole and then CPI. But with no big fed events, no cpi and no FOMC for another month what is going to be the catalyst? What is going to be the reason the VIX wants to spike? 

There might not be one for the next month. If there is no catalyst we might be looking at the VIX going back to that support line from the August low at 19.7. For me this is where we open a longer 30-60dte put position. We are in no mans land right now. Going short is fighting the trend but going long on calls feels like we are buying the absolutely top. 

Remember guys… CASH is a position! We don’t always have to be long. We can be cash over night. We can play some short 7-14 dte plays and wait for the next top/ bottom to more clearly present itself.

I will do weekly updates on this but also include it in my daily log. The general idea here is I will be using $5,000 for ONE trade per day.. the goal is 10% profits BUT a hard set -20% stop loss. We will see where this takes us and if we can make one trade a day for about 10% profitable or not. On the right side you can see I broke it down in an equivalent had you used a smaller account instead of my $5,000.

Overall this was a pretty great week. My most profitable week ever I believe and I also secured my biggest win ever this week with that CPI play. However, I recognize while that was a high probability play… if I was wrong and we opened flat I woulda closed my week out red. 

I also made some mistakes this week. I let a few of my level to level puts run way too long and pass my 25% stop loss. Still a struggle but letting the SPY put from yesterday run to today for -82.32% and taking a bigger -60%+ loss on Tesla earlier in the week really hit me hard. 

This week I absolutely KILLED it on scalps hitting 95% win rate and a nice $4,889. I had mentioned last week and earlier this week whether or not tesla plays were worth it or not. In review you can see that my win rate was much lower on them, however, profitability wise I actually was very successful. Something some fail to remember is that win rate doesn’t always equal profits. For this week low win rate still netted profits. 

I am always learning and always critiquing my strategy. I will continue to monitor my L2Ls and see how next week shapes up.

Twitter is currently losing money, and is on the brink of bankruptcy. Elon will have to either sell it at a discount or invest MORE money into this company. Either way, it will be for a loss. 

As many of you know, almost none of Elon’s money is liquid assets. They are primarily in Tesla stock. The purchasing of this bankrupt company (which he is ruining even more) will cause him to sell a significant amount of Tesla stock. 

This won’t change the stock price a significant amount (you won’t lose much money), but enough to make other billionaires lose out on tens or HUNDREDS of millions of dollars. THEY WILL SELL. This will cause a chain reaction causing any average Tesla stock holders to lose a lot of money and panic sell, dropping the stock even lower.

A beat on CPI actually makes trading SPY for the next month even harder then a miss. Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI “came down” we have to deal with yet again the “fed pivot/ slowing” news media cycles hitting the tapes. 

Overall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode.

SPY just made yet again market history… today was the 3rd largest daily point gain in market history, the 2nd largest intraday points swing, and the largest daily percent change this year (bear or bull). This was the largest green close since march 23rd 2009 which closed up 7.08%. 

What an incredible and unbelievable day.

We impressively broke through the daily rising wedge support last night at market close (now that makes a new support) and today we just touched and held the resistance of that same rising wedge. That is one hell of a swing and I cant even believe it myself. We also went from close in the bear channel to now closing in the purple channel completely skipping the green channel close. 

If the market is being rational it is going to come down and at least test 390 purple channel support. There could be a case for it to come all the way down to 384 or even 381.1 to gap fill. However, with the extreme volume on VOLD today and just the overall momentum I wouldn’t be surprised (despite it being illogical) to see tomorrow be yet another big green day. 

Support- 393 -&gt; 390 -&gt; 388 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 381.1

Resistance- 397.9 -&gt; 402 (daily 200ema) 

Something I would like to point out is that this day is very similar to May 4th on SPY. That was a FOMC day that went on a similar insane rip EOD and end up with a flat top daily candle much like SPYS today. That day resulted in a massive drop the next day. Something interesting about this also is that the VIX put its biggest drop of the year in since May 4th today also. Tomorrow will be interesting to say the least.

Weekly chart wise you can see we are still in this bull channel withing the green 2022 bear channel. Resistance of this channel is 397.6 (this is a potential place we could pop to tomorrow before retracing). We also have a rising wedge inside this bull channel to keep an eye on too. Next week 2022 bear channel resistance comes in at 412.7. We break that and effectively bear market is “over.” Technical wise.

One of the single most impressive daily candles ive ever seen on Futures. It didn’t quite make it to 3975 resistance but we very well overnight may touch it. 

Key support- 3905 -&gt; 3965 -&gt; 3805

Futures weekly setting up very similarly looking at the bull channel within the 2022 green bear channel with a rising wedge within that bull channel. 

4000 is the weekly 100ema and also the bull channel resistance for this week. 

4150 will be the weekly 2022 bear channel resistance for next week.

Apple with an impressive day closing up 8.9%. which is incredible. I don’t have the same data easily available on apple as I do spy but im sure since covid 2020 this is its and most of techs biggest closure. 

Apple broke through that red bear channel and actually closed over the daily 8, and 20ema falling just short of the daily 50ema. With the blue/ black falling wedge still in play that resistance will be 146.6 tomorrow and from there we can test the overall black bear channel dating back to august which has resistance of 153.4 tomorrow. 

Support- 144.9 -&gt; 141.2 -&gt; 138.5

Tesla is the wild child that no one wants to touch cause its so unpredictable. The biggest thing that happened today is that it failed to make a new daily low for the first time since October 31st. Many (me included) have been waiting for the bounce on telsa that just never came. We just might be looking at that bounce right now. With 190.9 clearly being resistance on Tesla we very well may be looking at our double top rejection. This daily hammer candle very well could result in a double top and further sell off tomorrow. 

Biggest thing to watch for tomorrow is whether Tesla closes below 188.3 or not which is the weekly 200ema. 

Support- 186.7 -&gt; 177.4

Resistance- 194.3 -&gt; 197 -&gt; 201.8

Pretty impressive candle on the daily chart here for the VIX. The biggest drop as I said since May 4th. While the VIX was in much different levels back then something that is VERY intriguing to me is that today we dropped to about 22.84 and recoiled and the VIX closed right at that key 23.5 support level. I am a little surprised to see that on a 5.5% green day for SPY. Actually I am surprised that the VIX didn’t drop more like 15% especially when you consider that on big red days for CPI or other events we can see a 12-20% green day on the VIX. 

This 23.5 level is a big level. The VIX could be hinting to us that the markets are not as bullish as this rally today wants us to believe. I will be watching for a double bottom pop on the VIX tomorrow. 

**Where am I at right now? Bearish or bullish ?**

To be honest we couldn’t have had a worse outcome today. A beat on CPI just leads to even more speculation from the markets that the Fed is going to pivot/ slow rate hikes next meeting. However, the thing is that MoM inflation did not come down and while yes these were “beats” under expectation and under previous its hard to say after one good reading that we beat inflation. With SPY now being over the 75% retracement line of the bear channel the risk to reward to run calls up here is very low. However, this rally could last too long and we may never see an actual drop to pay out on puts now. I don’t forsee until next CPI/ FOMC any thing big enough to actually put the markets in sell off mode. While I do think we pullback a little just to naturally fill some of this wildness I don’t think itll be too sustained. But playing calls up here just seems like playing with fire too. We are definitely in a short term play area right now.

However, lets keep this in mind… 

CPI YoY- 7.7% puts us at the lowest reading since February which was 7.5%.  
 CPI MoM- 0.4% was under forecast but was the same as previous… that means inflation is still increasing… don’t get this confused… we did not DECREASE inflation… it just didn’t go up as much…  
 CORE YoY- 6.3% is a decrease but only puts us back at September CORE of 6.3%. that means we saw core go up for one month and then come back down to the previous months numbers.   
 CORE MoM- 0.3% means after two back to back months of 0.6% MoM CORE we did finally decrease….   
 

Now here is something that I already have on my radar and will be doing a lot of data diving into to figure out the best play for next CPI/ FOMC which is back to back (thinking we can really nail a banger). 

Lets chat really quickly to put it on our radars about the August drop in CPI and the august rally (mind you this is the ONLY other “beat” on cpi all year). 

In August CPI YoY beat at 8.5% coming down 0.2% form forecast and an impressive 0.6% from previous. The interesting thing about this prediction was that the forecast was so far below the previous with the 0.2% variance it woulda been incredible if we missed. Interestingly enough the following reading for September came in 0.2% over forecast of 8.1% but WAS a beat and decrease. Looking at the numbers for CPI YoY we have now had 5 readings in a row of CPI YoY decreasing… 

CPI MoM in august was forecasted at 0.2% and came in at 0%. This is the closest we have been to a decrease in inflation all year but we have still NOT gotten an actual negative reading for MoM. After the August 0% reading we had 0.1% -&gt; 0.4% and now we have 0.4% again. So despite a BEAT of forecast CPI MoM has actually not seen a decrease to match CPI YoY. 

Since August CORE YoY of 5.9% which actually wasn’t even a beat from previous it was unchanged we had a 6.3% and now a 6.6% reading on YoY core. This reading was 0.2% beat from forecast and a 0.3% beat from previous. From the April CORE 6.5% reading until August we did see a decrease/ unchanged on core YoY. I will be closely watching to see if CORE YoY can unwind again or if we are going to go up. 

Core MoM was 0.3% in august which was a pretty impressive beat from the previous 0.7%. Much like CPI Mom we have not had a negative reading yet and we have not by any means tamed inflation but there has been slowing of CORE MoM unlike CPI MoM.

I am seeing a pretty big potential where we COULD get another good reading on inflation in December actually. Again everything comes down to the forecast. As long as the forecast comes in 0.2% below current actual readings so that would be forecast of CPI 7.5, CPI MoM 0.2, CORE 6.1 and CORE MoM 0.1% we actually could see another impressive beat and our first back to back green CPI days of the year. 

Now do I believe in real world that inflation is tamed? Absolutely not… no way… shit is so expensive its not funny and yeah used cars have come down (sucks more then It helps) new cars have not come down to match that used car drop. The biggest thing to watch for CPI on December 13th is 1. Will CPI YoY give its 5th consecutive drop, 2. Will CPI MoM and CORE MoM give their first negative readings (showing an actual decrease not just being unchanged) and 3. Will CORE cpi start the trend of coming down again.

The crazy bull case would be that we get back to back good readings on CPI come December 13th and then on December 14th while we still most likely get a 50bps this COULD give JPOW the fuel he needs to finally say the magical words to the market of “we are ready to slow hikes at the next meeting and see the full effect of our rate hikes.” A hinting at 25bps would be an pretty bullish thing and we could end up seeing December 13th and 14th turn into some impressively green two day rally based on that news. I will keep you guys posted and of course post a full trade plan and analysis/ breakdown for those two days.

Daily log- 

Today for me was an amazing day and for many in the server who played the strangle or amazingly played calls only the payout was phenomenal. After the morning win I did open one lotto put pretty early when things started to look heavy and that we wouldn’t take out 390 today, however, that quickly got wrecked. It was worth the risk to reward as I wouldn’t have in my wildest dreams expected a 5.5% green day on spy today. I am shocked we broke through 390 and that we kept pushing EOD even higher.

I played a few level to level plays on SPY but I couldn’t bring myself to scalp today. For me when we are at such an extreme and as much as I want to trust it to continue I struggle to believe in my plays which makes me struggle to believe in myself and I end up cutting early or cutting red when I shouldn’t have. Days like today are better left untraded for me. 

Tomorrow is going to be interesting to say the least. I wouldn’t put it past markets to not even look back and just straight push to gap fill 403 tomorrow but I more sensibly expect a 384 to 390 pullback.

New Twitter Inc. owner Elon Musk emailed his workers for the first time late Wednesday to prepare them for “difficult times ahead” and ban remote work unless he personally approved it.

Musk said there was “no way to sugarcoat the message” about the economic outlook and how it will affect an advertising-dependent company like Twitter, according to the email reviewed by Bloomberg News. The new rules, which kick in immediately, will expect employees to be in the office for at least 40 hours per week, he added.


Twitter has been under Musk’s leadership for close to two weeks, in which time he has dismissed roughly half its workforce and most of its executive suite. The new boss has upped the price for the Twitter Blue subscription to $8 and attached user verification to it. Musk told workers in the email that he wants to see subscriptions account for half of Twitter’s revenue.

Prior to Musk’s arrival, Twitter had established a permanent work-from-anywhere arrangement for its workers, many of whom had initially been pushed into remote work by the pandemic. It was one of the first topics in an all-hands call Musk held with Twitter staff after announcing the deal to buy the company earlier in the year. He said then that he’s against remote work and would only grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis, as he’s doing now.


He has also eliminated “days of rest” from Twitter staff calendars, Bloomberg News reported this month, which was a monthly, companywide day off introduced during the pandemic period. Its expiration gave another sign of Musk’s impatience with Twitter’s existing work culture.

“The road ahead is arduous and will require intense work to succeed,” Musk wrote in his missive to employees. In a separate email, he added that “over the next few days, the absolute top priority is finding and suspending any verified bots/trolls/spam.""",Let the brain drain begin.

Tesla opened a big gap up with the market due to the CPI's announcement.

After it opened with a gap up my assumption was that it would go down at the beginning of the trade and try to catch all the traders who think that it is now going to fly all the way up

After it reached the super strong support level $180 (you can see the triple bottom in the daily chart) and the trading volume increased in addition to the rotation of the market so from there I entered the trade, the target was at $186 on the downward trend line from the 30-minute chart.

SPY

SPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday’s low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday’s low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.

QQQ

QQQ held Tuesday’s low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.

DIA

DIA also held Tuesday’s low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA’s weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders’ attitude towards the market. 

XLF

The financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.

XLI

XLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium. 

Most popular tech stocks ended in the red. Apple fell 3.32% on news that the company's first AR glasses have encountered design problems, affecting the 2024 launch. Microsoft fell 1.91 percent as the company faces a new EU antitrust complaint about its cloud computing business; European Union antitrust regulators have launched a sweeping investigation into Microsoft's $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard.

Although it dropped 1.82% during the first 5 min, TSLA then rally back to $195.85, breaking Tuesday’s high but failed to fill the breakaway gap on Tuesday.

Here is my forecast based on historical CPI data and analysis. There is a chance based on Cleveland fed all miss besides CPI Yoy though. It will be a very spicy open. But something interesting to keep in mind is that this is the reddest pre-CPI day we have had since June. And for those of you who remember pretty much before July we used to get an almost standard and expected 2% intraday sell off on SPY the day before CPI… it appears we just started that trend again. Tomorrow will be interesting to watch. 

Will keep todays TA brief as we will have a massive move either way and the dust will settle and we can decide where we could be headed next.

We did break through that 378 key level support which has held up and we also broke through the rising wedge on the daily that we have been trading within since the last CPI. Based on my calculations bull case puts SPY somewhere between 385.3 to 389.1 tomorrow and bear case puts us near 362.9 to 359.2. 

Key daily supports around this range is 365 -&gt; 360 

Key daily resistance around this range is 384 -&gt; 388.6

Regardless of what reading is we are about to see the next big move and direction for markets. If CPI beats and JPOW truly can say next meeting that “inflation has slowed” and “we see reason finally to slow rate hikes” then we are going to see a push toward 400-420 by next CPI and FOMC (December 12/13th). However, if CPI misses (especially core and or MoM) then what JPOW said about not having inflation tamed and that it is pre-mature to even consider slowing hikes right now is about to be sang on every new outlet. If we miss I think we head down towards 320-340 before the next CPI/ FOMC in December.

Apple just closed below its last CPI candle body low of 134.9. Today tech as a whole (besides meta) looked probably the worst it has looked In a very long time. This further tells me that a CPI miss is not price in and that tech especially will get absolutely slaughtered. 

Looking at previous CPIs 5-6% movement is possible on Apple that gives us a possible 127.8 to 126.5 tomorrow which would be a new 52 week low for Apple… actually Apple right here is 4.4% from its 52 week low at close of market today. This is the first close below 138.4 support level since June of this year. 

Support- 129.9 -&gt; 125.8

Resistance- 138.5 -&gt; 140.4 -&gt; 142.1

Zoomed out on tesla is beyond ugly and I feel like this thing is just going to get driven down until it closes under $100/ share. Currently 172.2 support is the 2022 bear channel on Tesla if that level breaks then there is just the massive weekly bear channel left as you can see. This also potentially will be the first close under the weekly 200ema since October 2019.

The VIX remains hella underwhelming putting in a mild 2.15% green day on the eve of CPI. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the VIX somewhere between 27 and 28.3 at open tomorrow and we could breach 30 if CPI misses that big. 

Daily log- 

Honestly I struggled today with the technical. A lot of oversold indicators then pushing $1-$2 through that level to then reverse then push further. I got stopped out a few times only for it to go green and I didn’t close green for it to reverse on me too. Overall ended green thanks to a few scalps but tough day for me. 

See what tomorrow brings with CPI.

199,1668014110,yqp3aw,1,"A few things first;

- Elon does not own above 50% of Tesla. 


- Elon can be fired from Tesla. 


- Elon is the main reason for TSLA shares to trade so high.


Question is, is it worth keeping him? 


If we solely think of stock performance as a sign of success and well being of a company, Elon can be considered a huge asset. Absurd price of the stock even today is only due to him being the CEO... well sort of was. The sentiment is quickly changing. 


IMO Elon's job at TESLA is done. The company is sustainable and cannot be outdone by other companies in the global market. Though competition in the Chinese market is too hot for any real benefit in the long run. 


In the recent earning report many people were pointing out how margins are falling and inventory was going up. 


These are products of high inflation and rising cost of materials. It's nothing out of the ordinary. The fact that the company is still able to grow is what you want to see in this economic climate. 


Toyota's lean inventory management was successful in the last 20 years due to stable commodity markets and a very efficient worldwide shipping network. Today these are both high affected by the pandemic and high inflation. To make it simpler for smooth brains. Cost of storing inventory may be lower than paying more for inventory every month due to highly volatile raw materials. Higher inventory is a sign of preparedness which I welcome.


IMO Tesla is here to stay and will still come out on top after the dust settles. 


But is TSLA a $200 - $300 stock? Not even close. I think it will land somewhere between $75-90. Many tech companies' valuations are garbage. Tesla will find its place in automotive industry though still be valued slightly above due to its brand recognition and the tech and solar power element of the company. 


It's just a matter of deciding when to part ways with Elon and not an if. 


This is just my two bananas.

https://preview.redd.it/zx6vsox4tsy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5618d367fd9817265cc7d6b0ef40f2906fbcff48

The last 4 daily candles are completely ugly with all these massive wicks and huge ranges and volatility. But we reconfirmed 378 as support on that huge sell off intraday and I am looking for 388 to 390 tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day before CPI there is a very likely scenario where we trade between 378 and 384 all day in anticipation of CPI. This would be much like October 31st if that happens. However, if we look at September CPI (highlighted by the blue circle) despite the difference in candle structure we are actually seeing a VERY similar set up. We had a bounce off a key support level (September was 390 and now is 370.5) and that was followed by 4 green days (for a total of 5.5%... we are currently at 2.1%). We could see a bigger push tomorrow to that 390 level which would get us about 5.4% rally over 4 days prior to CPI. 

If you remember September the market was pretty bullish back then too and was under the anticipation that CPI would beat pretty bigly. However, it missed huge and back then much like now the market was Not prepared for a huge miss on CPI. 

When I look at the VIX now and IV compared to the last few CPIs the vix is extremely low and IV rank/ IV is very low. For instance today IV was around 30-32 which last CPI was 40-50. The market is not hedged for a huge miss or a huge CPI dump… I stand by if we get a big miss (read my cpi trade plan posted under pre-market analysis) that we might get our biggest red open and we might see a repeat of September also.

I didn’t talk about it under SPY but futures much like spy did break that FOMC resistance line today. We are holding that 3805 as support nicely, however, hard rejected at 3865. I am looking for futes to retest 3865 tomorrow and push for next major resistance at 3925. A rejection at 3925 and SPY 390 would actually form a really nice daily double top prior to a bad CPI reading and could be the “top” for a while.

And then there was tesla… once again another massively red sell off on tesla, however, this time it had a nice intraday recovery. Tesla is now down $37.05 in 3 days and $50.65 total over the last 6 days. That is a pretty insane sell off on Tesla.

Looking at the weekly ( I don’t usually talk about the weekly chart intraweek but this one is important to show). On that morning sell off Tesla hit its weekly 200ema. This is the first time Tesla has touched the weekly 200ema since October 2019. Even during the covid crash tesla never touched its 200ema on the weekly. It did touch and bounce aggressively off its 100ema though. 

If Tesla is going to bounce… this is the best chance it has. In addition unless Tesla opens under 182.4 -3.7% it will break its red dotted aggressive 3 day sell off resistance line and I believe attempt to go for its 197 gap fill tomorrow.

The VIX is at a very interesting crossroads here… it is holding now in a consolidation pattern 24.4 to 25.8 and remains in its downward bear channel. 

The June CPI which from these levels resulted in a 3 day spike of the VIX for 32.1% was at 23.8 the day before CPI. The June 10th CPI resulted in a -1.66% open and closed down -2.9%.

The July CPI was at 25.79 two days before CPI and resulted in a smaller 11.3% spike over 3 today. The July CPI opened down -1.52% but closed only down -0.52%. 

The September CPI was at 22.64 two days before CPI and resulted in a 3 day spike of 19.6%. The September CPI opened down -2.2% (the reddest CPI open) and closed down -4.35%. 

We COULD expect a 21% spike on the VIX starting today through Thursday EOD. This means Thursday the VIX should hit 29.3. But realistically could end up somewhere between 26.9 and 31.9 on Thursday. We also COULD be looking for about a -1.79% red open (or somewhere between -1.5% to -2.2% Thursday morning) if CPI misses. 

The thing to keep in mind at least for me is that this market much like September is not in any shape or form position for a big miss. I also do not think if we do miss we see a repeat of October or July because back then we were at the 52week low and people were HEAVILY hedged with puts. But now that people are not positioned that way it will be much harder for us to rally intraday especially with the VIX so low.

I don’t study the P/C ratio as I feel its never helped and is just a data point but currently the P/C is 2.34% and the IV is 41.3% which is relatively low IV wise compared to the last CPI where were near 50. The call volume actually greatly outweighs the put volume (maybe someone can explain this better then me) but the actual put OI is much higher then the Call OI.

Today was a pretty good day… not going to lie not being greedy saved me about 4 different times from getting wrecked… I luckily opened that tesla call at a lotto size and was able to average down and get out with a smaller loss but still not great. 

Interestingly enough data wise for me today I went 100% with SPX scalps (weeks win rate is 90.9%), and my level to level plays intraday on spy were also 100% win rate (with the weekly win rate being 85.7% for just spy level to levels). However, I am 0 for 2 this week on tesla L2L plays and last week I hit 71.5% win rate… for the last two weeks for just Tesla L2Ls I am averaging 55.5% win rate…. For the last two weeks my P/L $ on Tesla L2Ls alone is -$389 and last week with my 71.5% win rate I had a P/L$ of $1279.

I had that 60% loss yesterday on Tesla (shoulda been cut at -30%) that if it was not for that I would be profitable on my L2Ls. But I like to anlayze my trades to see if what im doing is working or not. I will be keeping a close eye on this the rest of week and next week to see if there is a case to stop my Tesla L2Ls and stick to strictly SPY.

I hear many people here saying they’re not going to buy a Tesla because of Elon. You’re not alone. There are millions of progressives around the country who won’t want to either.

What I am curious about is what happens if Tesla becomes the only US EV you can buy (1) with the full subsidy (2) within a reasonable timeframe. Yes, others like the Bolt with ultium will have the subsidy too, but it’s highly likely that they won’t be able to meet demand…..

So what happens? Dealerships become thieves. Salesmen hint that $1000 puts you on the waitlist for this year—otherwise wait till 2024! Dealerships put on thousand of dollars of mandatory upgrades. Dealerships have a MSRP adjustment. And the price won’t be guaranteed on delivery. You go to buy one of the few non tesla full subsidy EVs and suddenly you’re facing thousands of dollars of fees.

I am truly, honest before the gods, sympathetic to people who are annoyed with Elon rn. I am too. But how much of a premium are these feelings worth? It is almost a guarantee that by the time the ^ situation I spelled out above plays out, (1) a standard 4680 model Y will have a $ per mile of range as cheap, or cheaper, than competition because it will receive the full IRA subsidy. 

I know everyone here is aware of the shitty state of the non tesla charging network. These stories will grow. I have a friend who bought the id4 that won’t road trip with it anymore. They are not alone. 

So hate Elon all you want. I don’t blame you. But let’s be honest… the tesla cost advantage is going to grow, and unless legacy seriously reforms the dealership system and third party charging reliability goes up significantly…then the cost of avoiding tesla for an EV *in the future* goes up a lot.",Elon and tesla,1.0,2022-11-08 13:09:57

Despite the struggle almost all day for SPY to break through 370 resistance we finally saw spy break through before power hour and end the day extremely bullish. The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. 

However, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday.

Futures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It’s a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. 

If 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s. 

Key support- 3805 -&gt; 3750 -&gt; 3675

Key resistance- 3865 -&gt; 3925

Apple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill. 

Key support- 138.1 -&gt; 137.1 -&gt; 135

Key resistance- 142.1 -&gt; 145

And then there was Tesla…. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. 

Highlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom. 

Key support- 197 -&gt; 193.3 -&gt; 184.3

Key resistance- 201.8 -&gt; 205.6

The VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn’t hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days… the VIX has either closed red OR closed &lt;1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfln1xilrly91.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e379545443901d6c0c50c5a1f720a6322505f6c6

Looking at the fear and greed index… we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot… from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. 

The current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  

Januarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  
 Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  
 Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  
   
 

That would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days… that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th…. 

Now hear me out on this one which is even more WILD… December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)…. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible… 

Something to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week. 

Daily log- 

Today was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn’t miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it… though I wouldn’t have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. 

The best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week… every trade is a new chance… If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. 

Something I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play. I don’t want to get in a habit of that with these level to levels even though I know sometimes they need time to mature… this COULD result in a lower win rate as I may stop out more BUT for instance today had I stopped out on my Tesla and SPY level to levels that closed very red I would have ended up very green today. 

Actually had a capped my L2L plays at -25% today for the two losers I would have only closed down -$50 for my L2L plays and with my $1249 from scalps today woulda ended the day up $1199 instead im ending it down about $103. 

Youtube will be up later!

This is a question I must get at least 10 times a day. So I am going to indepth do my best to explain to you guys what a Level to Level or L2L play is for me. 

The whole reason I started including more of these is that despite this being a scalpers market I realize its nearly impossible for someone to mirror a scalp. While it can be done the reward generally will never be as great as mine for the mirror. These plays are more of a set it and forget it sort of play and a play that due to the longer DTE and longer time held everyone can play them while still having a great risk to reward play. 

**Picking a DTE**

First off this is NOT a scalp this is a play that will usually take a while to develop and very well could develop overnight too. With that in mind that immediately means we need a slightly longer DTE to utilize. For SPY I prefer a 3-5dte, however, this also greatly varies on the actual way premiums and theta are hitting. When I play a Tesla or Apple L2L I prefer at least 3dte or longer. Since general stocks only expire on Fridays that means pretty much after Tuesday I will refer to the next weeks DTE. The issue especially with a stock like Tesla is that it moves like Wildfire so if you are wrong or the play does move against you then you will need to your way you will get wrecked before its ever worth it. 

You have to weigh a short enough DTE that the move nets you profits quickly but not so short that if the play takes time to develop as it usually does that you don’t end up missing out hugely. 

**Choosing the correct position size** 

This is the one tricky thing about the L2L plays. We have to chose a size big enough that the risk to reward is there and that we get a nice pay out. However, we can not immediately open such a large position size that we end up with a big loss if it goes against us. 

The way I enter my position sizes is of a normal scalp size (which is about $2000-$2500 for me). I like to open at least 50-75% immediately depending on how strongly I feel about the play. If I feel its going to be a pretty aggressive move and that im timing pretty much right before the bounce then I will open closer to 75% if not more and end up near $2000 for the trade. However, if like Friday I expect it to consolidate first possibly then I will usually start with about $1000-$1500 initially opened. This allows me to average down if I feel the play is valid and it holds my stop loss. 

But wait! DD you say averaging down a loser is just making a loser a bigger loser!? Correct! I did say that… however, that applies mostly for a scalp. I NEVER add to my scalps because those are 0dte… And those are pretty much hit or miss. I either immediately hit profits and close or im pretty much immediately wrong too. So averaging that down is not smart. However, this play factors in an average down on purpose and also uses clear support/ resistance levels to average down. 

**When to stop loss out**

The thing about these level to level plays that I enjoy is that they have a built in stop. So let me post an example of that from Friday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyxlirrs5dy91.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c334066f4339df0ea6f1b3621210da0c8aed6c2a

So here you can see I already KNEW that my stop loss was going to be if a candle closes below 370.6. Now you gotta be forgiving with this too. So within reason because we did have a candle close near 370.5. So if we had closed under 370 I would have closed this play. The important thing I factor into this also is that I want my stop loss to be somewhere around 20% still. That’s just how my risk to reward and win rate works. I don’t want one L2L loss to wipe out numerous L2L wins. 

**When to average down?** 

Lets take a look at a Tesla L2L I took on Friday also and this will be a great example of a time where averaging down works. Friday when tesla on the daily had appeared to be holding 210 support and forming a nice double bottom I entered a 7dte ATM Call. My take profit target was near 215 to 219.3. Looking back at the daily and weekly charts I know that Tesla for the last 2 weeks has broken through 205.6 support numerous times but everytime it has popped back up and refused to close below it. So what I did was purposefully make my stop loss closing UNDER 205.6 EOD. This gave me enough room where at the LOD I still only saw about -30% 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke1qvu9t5dy91.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2afd0346939b4b734eba1c269086788d3729de0

Okay above you can see my call out on the play. Now lets look at how it actually played out intraday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ud60poqt5dy91.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37d77f12eb18e0ec03fda6482dfa1f8baa974a58

So with this Tesla L2L you REALLY had to trust the levels. You had to trust that even though we broke key support that we were going to see a recovery by EOD which has historically happened time and time again. This was a great Risk to reward play as this is probably one of the strongest levels tesla has. 

Now looking back I could have absolutely waited for 205.6 support test before initially entering the play, but on Friday you can see we had that massive sell off after a strong morning and we had bounced off that key 210 support are intraday and was appearing to recover. The one thing looking back that I DID misplay on this was not waiting for the candle to break back over the 5ema before entering this play. However, leaving room to average down and knowing the key levels we can be a little aggressive and sometimes snag a more reward in doing so if we recognize the risk. 

So here once EOD we broke back over that 205.6 level and closed back over the 5ema I was able to average down on my call. I did end up hitting exactly break even at one point EOD before the choppiness hit. With this support level being so strong I felt comfortable swinging this over the weekend. Knowing that we could retest 205.6 but most likely would bounce but after that EOD recovery I expect to see a bigger push up at open Monday to look for an exit. 

**How I choose the play**

The way I choose my level to level plays is based off daily price action along with current intraday price action. What I am looking for is when we find a key support area on the daily chart that the intraday 15min chart is then finding support at. 

Lets take a look at another example from Friday 11/4/22 on SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0l8hhl9u5dy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=989b59106a6c151a892065b2d55b64a1066306cd

Taking a look at Friday here is a L2L play that I made on Friday. So you can see I clearly have highlighted in purpose 370.6 as a key support. This is one of my levels established from my TA on the SPY daily chart. What I saw here is that after the massive morning sell off we bounced hard off 370.6 and continued to hold all candles closing over this level. We had about 10 candles bounce off this level total. When I saw this extremely strong support establishing around this level I knew it was time to enter a LEVEL TO LEVEL play. 

The first thing and most important thing is we have to chose a DTE. For me I chose a 5DTE. Why did I choose a 5DTE? When we first bounced and double bottomed off the 370.6 level at noon I Did expect a big bounce back up near that 374.9 resistance, however, I knew it could consolidate there first (which is exactly what ended up happening). Had I taken a 0dte play here by time EOD that move up finally happened I would have been. 

Now that I chose the correct DTE we have to set our TP target and our Stop loss target. 

Take profit will for a call play be the next resistance which in this case is 374.9. 

Stop loss target as I mentioned was a FULL candle closed below 370.6. As breaking that key support would signal a bigger downside to come on SPY. On the daily 370.6 is actually a huge level support that separates periods of price action. 

Once we enter the play do we diamond hand it or do we take profits when we can? Well this is where things get tricky. In the end PROFITS are KING.

Here is what it looks like for me at least on a few different L2L plays from earlier Friday morning. As you can see for these I actually entered a 3dte and 5dte on SPY (I actually usually do this to show you guys the difference in pay out not so much because I wanna play it both ways) but for tesla I did enter the 0dte because in the morning that’s how strongly I felt about the play and knew it would hit quick but would let the 7dte tesla play out longer.

Usually I look for at least 10% but if I recognize that things have turned against me then I will exit for a much smaller gain. There is no reason to let a play go red… 3% green is better then -20% red. 

Generally I will just add some stop limit orders as you can see and I will continue to increase that level as price moves in my direction. And if it stops me out green well it’s a win either way! Now the issue here is that many many times I stop out way before the actual L2L ever fully plays out. Which means I miss out on a HUGE win, however, if you look at the first stop limits here I was playing the 374.9 support to 378 breakout and got a nice win. I really thought we were going to see a huge green day and very well could have let those run think we see 380-385. However, had I done that on Friday I would have taken a massive loss on that sell off. 

I would say the biggest risk on these L2L plays is that we can not use a hard fast and set stop loss. If we do at say -20% like we usually do then we may stop out before key support actually holds and the play develops. However, when the key support or resistance against us breaks we have to exit and be okay accepting the loss. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img vvzvvgcv5dy91...*

Here is an example of when I actually followed my own stop loss and had I actually diamond handed it this play the very next candle would have been back to profits. However, we HAVE to be mechanical in trading. We cant be smarter then the candles or the charts. IF the play fails it fails. If it comes back to life after we close it… then that’s something we can consider and something to take into play about perhaps using a looser stop loss next time but in my opinion for every play that came back from the dead there are 10 that never came back. My losers that I have held that never come back GREATLY outweigh those that come back to life.

Nouriel Roubini worries about Elon Musk, a self-described “free-speech absolutist,” running Twitter.
SIMON DAWSON—BLOOMBERG/GETTY IMAGES
Nouriel Roubini believes Elon Musk’s decision to buy Twitter was “a very bad idea,” and he considers the Tesla CEO “a bit of a lunatic” when it comes to regulating—or not regulating—speech on the social network.

The New York University economist, known as “Dr. Doom” for his pessimistic economic views—he predicted the 2008 housing bust and subsequent crisis—sees problems with Musk, a self-described “free-speech absolutist,” controlling a major social media platform.

“I think, honestly, the guy is a bit of a lunatic when it comes to these views of what is the proper, I would say, regulation of these platforms,” Roubini said in an interview with Fortune. “There are certain things that are inappropriate, and the current Twitter does its best, not perfectly, to try to limit that stuff.”

Musk, in a note to advertisers on Oct. 27—the day his $44 billion takeover deal was finalized—said he bought Twitter to “try to help humanity, whom I love,” and that he wants to turn the platform into a “common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.”

But Twitter experienced a surge in racial slurs and anti-Semitic remarks immediately after Musk took over, drawing complaints from NBA star LeBron James and other big names.

Roubini noted that “lots of anti-Semites, racists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis are spreading misinformation that is fed by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea to try to destroy our liberal democracy. And now [Musk is] saying, ‘I want all these people to be allowed to have a platform and spread this misinformation.’”


Musk, in response to a surge in N-word usage on Twitter after his takeover, pointed to an employee’s explanation that “nearly all of these accounts are inauthentic. We’ve taken action to ban the users involved in this trolling campaign—and are going to continue working to address this in the days to come to make Twitter safe and welcoming for everyone.”

He also rushed to reassure advertisers, in his Oct. 27 note, that Twitter would not become a “free-for-all hellscape,” adding the company would form a content moderation council “with widely diverse viewpoints” and that “no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.” 

But some major companies are already leaving the platform. General Motors, Pfizer, Volkswagen, and others have paused their advertising on the social network.

While insisting that Twitter won’t become a place “where anything can be said with no consequences,” Musk has indicated that users will have more leeway to say what they want, however offensive or misleading, than they had before. And he heavily criticized the company’s former leaders—some of whom he immediately fired—for being too strict and suppressive. 


“By ‘free speech,’ I simply mean that which matches the law,” he tweeted in April. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.”

Roubini said that Musk would, in principle, allow “any form [of] ‘free speech.’” But, he said, “there’s a limit even to free speech. You’re not allowed to go dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member in front of a Jewish or an African American family with guns threatening them. That’s not acceptable. You want to demonstrate, you’re allowed to demonstrate, but not to physically threaten other individuals in our society. So free speech is not unlimited.”

Shortly after taking over the platform, Musk dropped hints about how he might address the risk of Twitter becoming too toxic for some users. He suggested that, just as moviegoers use maturity ratings to decide which films to watch, Twitter users could pick their own levels of content moderation. 

Central to the issue is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (passed in 1996), which shields internet platforms from liability for content posted by third parties. 

Roubini takes issue with the legislation and believes it needs to be modified.


“We will have to rethink that particular section in a way that doesn’t eliminate some of the protection,” he said, “but doesn’t give protection to the extent that we have today, which essentially allows any type of…disgusting, criminal, violent, threatening messages to be broadcast. That’s not acceptable in any civil society, period.”",Wall Street’s ‘Dr. Doom’ says Elon Musk is a ‘lunatic’ when it comes to social media regulation,1.0,2022-11-06 13:35:07

Next week we have election midterms and we have CPI. I will this weekend or next week sometimes post my CPI trade plan to the server but for now here is my expectations for CPI next week after running the numbers. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/elizrxa930y91.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=523d615fe4c4afde022a1f70471e1cc3a5b4bae9

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2jv8guqa30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0221f5520ba291ee83d3caff612c9865da3810

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it… yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside. 

Key support- 3775 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3910 -&gt; 4085

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support – 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.2 -&gt; 147.1 -&gt; 150.8

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that’s for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn’t be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope. 

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly enough… this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!

I’m new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I’m less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I’ll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It’s hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I’m really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I’m not sure if they are genius or crazy… Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154€ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back.

Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR?p=TWTR&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) employees filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday, accusing the company of violating federal and state laws that govern notice of employment termination.

The employees, based in Twitter’s San Francisco and Cambridge, Mass., offices, are asking a California district court to grant class-action status on behalf of thousands of [employees expected to be laid off from the company on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-to-start-mass-layoffs-at-twitter-on-friday-005242825.html). One named plaintiff was terminated on Nov. 1, days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s acquisition of the company.

The Twitter workers claim that mass layoffs, if carried out on Friday, would violate a federal law called the Work Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, as well as California’s state WARN Act. They also pointed out that Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla is facing a similar lawsuit from a group of workers laid off from a Nevada factory.

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn’t happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn’t rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really “cheap” opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low… this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel… lol yes I know right? 

Key support- 138.2 -&gt; 135 -&gt; 130

Key resistance- 142.2 -&gt; 144.8

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that “mid” point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow. 

Key support- 214.9 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.6

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn’t seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out… which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that “oh wow yeah lets sell” reason again and I don’t forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that’s where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn’t ready to slow or pause… he said inflation aint fixed… so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us… how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn’t spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish.

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a “we will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.” 

But tomorrow will be interesting to say the least!

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.1 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 397.8 (my potential target for a bullish FOMC)

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish.

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema.

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it.

As I had mentioned this is the first FOMC since June that the VIX has not popped significantly the day before. To me this means markets are bullish. I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don’t like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn’t expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons.

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback.

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema.

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support.

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

Lets flash back to last Friday… The beginning of of the week had a nice green two days followed by a doji Wednesday and a hammer candle on Thursday. This hammer candle showed downside potential and after hours did too. Then Friday came and out of no where ripped a 2.45% green day… Flash forward to this week its nearly an identical movement. I mean 100% identical. Scary at best. 

Today I am not too proud to admit I misplayed 100% and I unknowingly was far to bearish and bet against the markets. The worst part is… I even called this weekly rally last week in my weekly TA.

Guess I should trust myself a little more huh? I definitely got blinded by the big tech earning misses, GDP coming in hot af, PCE/ PMI, job claims, etc etc etc. all of that was bearish af for the week. But what happened? Market didn’t care… why? Because the markets still believe JPOW is going to say on Wednesday at 230pm for FOMC (stay tuned this weekend I will release the FOMC trading plan to the server) that “we have inflation under control or we don’t wanna over shoot on rate hikes so we will look to slow down our hikes in December.”

This is why we are rallying in my opinion. 

So where does this leave us next week… well this is the scenarios I forsee. 

Monday and Tuesday I have pinned for a bullish because we really don’t have anything on the books negative wise. I don’t forsee anything economic or macro wise to really bring us down and its pretty clear by this weeks movements and recovery that bulls are in control and the markets is not going to sell off (I misplayed that today). 

Wednesday is FOMC day… I expect a green day. Now the question will be does JPOW rightfully say “we have not controlled inflation and while we do not want to overshoot rate hikes we need to slow inflation first” if he says this then we should look for a dump into CPI. However, if he says “I believe inflation is tamed and we will see the effects of that on the next CPI and going forward and that should allow us to slow our rate hikes… slow not pause…” we are going to rally. 

From there I honestly don’t forsee CPI coming in as a beat at all.. it actually is going to probably be a huge miss… if you remember back in August when CPI came in hot they held off on releasing the consensus (just like now) until we got very close to CPI… I have a feeling after or the day of FOMC we will see the consensus finally released. Which will allow me to accurately predict next CPI…   
 

Regardless of whether we rally or dump after FOMC I expect us to get a bad CPI reading and I will be looking for a repeat of August. What I think is happening is a tactful unwinding of the VIX prior to FOMC and CPI to avoid the crash once again. It seems like this is the general strategy that has happened time and time again. We get these rallies through bad news, and every dip is a buying opportunity where the technical make zero sense (such as this morning where VOLD was extreme bearish and nearly extreme bearish however we saw markets continue to rip). 

In short im bullish till Wednesday then we will take it from there…

In short SPY has maintained this red bull channel for 2 weeks now and until I see this bull channel broken I will remain bullish. I am seeing today we made a really nice double bottom off 379.8 which also was a daily 8ema support test and hold (this is the big play I over looked today with my bearish bias). In addition we put in a 2 day (almost 3) bullish engulfing daily candle. With maintaining and holding within this green channel and failing to retrace through it I am seeing that a 390.1 resistance test will be coming on Monday. The question is do we level up and push for the 400s before FOMC or do we reject that 390 level Monday and actually spend some time consolidating before FOMC. 

Fun note- this week is now the only the 2nd time this year that markets have put in a green week the week before FOMC the other time was July. 

If and when we break through 390 then I will be looking as the 50% retracement line of the bear channel and start eyeing 405.1 as next level resistance. I am not quite convinced that we will have the steam to get there but I do think we could take 395-400 before FOMC or on FOMC day (if jpow is bullish). 

However, if Monday we reject 390.1 channel resistance I would look for this red bull channel support to be tested and see if that 380 support holds. The one thing to note is that this is the first time a candle has closed over 388.6 since September 22nd.

Funny enough about this weekly candle is that this candle last night was showing a 100% different story. However, todays candle is our 2nd green week in a row and our first back to back green weeks since August. With this candle I look for continuation, however, we did fall just short of breaking through the weekly 20ema. We will need to take that level out then we can start looking at that next major level resistance of 408.9. 

If we double top of the weekly 20ema we could see a retracement back to that 375.6 weekly level. 

Key support- 385.2 -&gt; 375.6 -&gt; 363.7

Key resistance- 390 -&gt; 399.8 -&gt; 409.9

Futures put in a massive green day today and dead ended right at that 3925 level which just so happens to be its daily 100ema. On the bullish side of things you can see we held the daily 8ema as support today, reconfirmed 3800 as support and broke through the bear channel from August. There is no longer (besides the 2022 bear channel resistance) downward resistance to watch for. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fscdh1z28mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e808dce0070bfd9ff8ae8db162339380956d5f3

Futures actually was able to close over the weekly 20ema. However, as you can see it fell just short of breaking through the orange channel level resistance of 3925. Next week we will look for futures to turn 3925 into support which should open up an opportunity for futes to test next level resistance around 4085. 

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705

Apple put in one hell of an impressive day today making a total intraday movement of $9.68 which was 179% of its 10day average range. It also put in 175% of its 30day average volume today. People poured into Apple today. I think people found their “safe haven.”

Apple actually broke through its bull channels resistance and topped out right at 157.5 resistance today. With that being where apple hit and retraced we will look for that as key resistance to break over next week. 

This is the first time Apple has closed over the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema since September 12th. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple weekly played perfectly off the levels… for those who say TA don’t work or that you cant TA stuff when its parabolic… today even on a ridiculously big move Apple still respected levels. These chart levels were untouched and it closed right under that key 157.5 weekly level. 

With apple bounced off that red support line, holding 147.2 as support and closing over all the EMAs we should naturally look for some upside next week. 

Key support- 150.6 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 141.2

Key resistance- 155.8 -&gt; 161.2

My love and hate relationship with Tesla is unmatched by anything else. Tesla provided me with 3 huge wins 3 days in a row, however, today I became too bearish and burnt myself playing some level to level plays. Now that I am being more objective I actually see a pretty bullish case for tesla next week. 

We came back down and tested the daily 8ema and managed to close back over that. However, we did fall just short of 230 resistance and the daily 20ema resistance. Tesla looked like it had no sense of direction today and that could have possibly been related to the twitter deal being completed today. 

With this hanging man candle on the daily I am looking for a repeat of 10/24/22 and will look to see a bigger push up on Tesla Monday/ next week. We are right at key resistance for the blue bear channel which lies at 228 for Monday. 

There is a case to be made as I mentioned earlier this week that tesla is establishing a consolidation channel from 205 to 230 and honestly until we close over 230 we haven’t officially broken that trend yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla still has a daily and weekly gap at 262.47 to fill. I don’t forsee that filling next week but with a bullish enough sentiment and bullish enough FOMC its not out of the realm of possibilities. Bulls are not trading back over the weekly 50% bear channel retracement mark and will look to turn 2330 turn into support next week. 

Support -204.5 -&gt; 191.7

Resistance- 245 -&gt; 254.7

As I had mentioned I do believe we are seeing the VIX being unwound before FOMC and next CPI. Its generally bad juju to have it over 30 before such events happen. With us clearly trading under the key 28.4 and now under 27 I will look for a the VIX to be near 23.6 to 24.7 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

10% challenge- 

Overall despite finishing green today (bless up tesla) today was not a great day for me. I was too biased bearish and I couldn’t get a read on the technical today. VOLD (difference of buy/ sell on NYSE) is one of my biggest indicators and biggest check boxes for entering a trade. Today until about 1145am VOLD was not supporting any sort of rallying. IT actually was showing that a huge sell off should have occurred. This also put me overly bearish, however, the charge was led by SPY and tech today and by mid day NYSE jumped on board finally. From there I still took every rejection (consolidation) at key levels as a short opportunity and ended up missing out on some good bull plays. 

Cant win them all and no ones perfect but I look forward to a good weekend to reset my head and trade better next week. This has been a pretty tough 3 days to trade in my opinion. Monday and Tuesday were great though thankfully. 

My Apple put was toasted at open but took a nice win on that Amazon earnings play at open to recoup most of the loss… apparently I shoulda gone even more OTM as one of the 80s puts on Amazon paid 1k%+ at open.

I was able to record my most profitable week in two months and my most profitable week of the year. Which actually is more impressive being that im trading with ½ the position size still that I traded with from January to May.

I have gotten a lot of questions of “how did you go from 6 out of 8 weeks being red to 8 green weeks in a row? “How is it even possible to go from losing that much to winning like this now?” 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time… risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”

I say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover.

280,1666987606,yfz64h,1,"On Elon Musk’s first day in control of Twitter, a person who walked out of the company’s San Francisco headquarters and identified themselves as a data engineer there said they were just laid off. CNBC was not able to immediately verify the identity of that person and one other who made a similar claim.

One employee at Twitter, awaiting information about layoffs or projects, told CNBC they were in the dark for the most part. Musk was meeting with relatively low-ranking engineering managers, this person noted —a welcome gesture to some. Press reports before the deal closed said that Musk had planned cuts as deep as 75% of headcount.

Twitter did not respond to repeated requests for comment about layoffs.

Musk finally took over the company on Thursday, ending a months-long legal saga. The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO initially agreed to buy the company for $44 billion, but soon after tried to get out of the deal because he claimed Twitter was not forthcoming enough about spam accounts on the platform. Twitter has denied that and went to court to try to get Musk to complete the deal.

Prior to the original trial date earlier this month, Musk agreed once again to close the deal. The judge gave Musk until Friday at 5 p.m. to close the deal, or else set a new trial date.

On Thursday, several top executives departed the company, including CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal, CNBC’s David Faber reported. Twitter’s head of legal policy, trust and safety Vijaya Gadde was also fired.

281,1666981669,yfwrlh,1,"I keep hearing the argument that Apple will be displaced because Nokia and Blackberry were.
That they haven’t innovated since Jobs.

I still think the stock is a great buy and they will continue to dominate.

Anyone who compares Apple to Nokia or Blackberry are foolish. 

It was extremely simple to go from Blackberry to Apple. It’s not easy for someone to exit Apple’s ecosystem.

Apple has a “walled garden” approach to their ecosystem. Easy and fun to enter … hard and impractical to exit.

Blackberry and Nokia didn’t have the same reasons to hook people onto their phones and platform for life. 

They made only phones. Apple surrounds your life with as many products as possible all seemingly working with each other.

If you want to switch it’d be time consuming and annoying. 

You’d have to figure out how to take all your years of photos from one device to another.

It’s got over ten years of my health info.
Tons of apps I’ve paid for and use daily that I’d have to rebuy and resetup on a new platform. Some of those apps don’t have a real alternative I like on android.

If I bought movies or tv shows on iTunes I’d lose access to them on any new platform. Or I have Apple services like Apple Card and Apple Wallet that wouldn’t transfer. 

I’ve got airpods that work solely with my apple products. Not to mention my Mac, Apple TV, Watch and iPad. They all work together. It’d be huge investment switching. Who can afford it.

No other platform is as seamlessly integrated and “walled off”. It was a risky idea for a
Apple to attempt it. Probably why no one else had tried it. After all it in some ways prevents people from adopting your product when you don’t play nice with other platforms. But, now that they pulled it off it’s perfect.

Is it possible for me to change? … sure but it’d be a pain (time wise) and costlier than just upgrading my iPhone.

If a revolutionary product comes out… iPhone users are patient enough for Apple to come out with their on spin on it. That’s what’s happened so far. Android gets a great new feature and sometimes it takes awhile but iPhone gets something similar.

People have sunken too much investment in terms of time(learning the ins and outs of it) and money into Apple products and services. They probably don’t want to start from scratch in a different ecosystem.

Apple has been milking that for years.

There’s always the chance I guess that some company tries to automate the process of switching by giving out free products and services… automating everything in terms of switching. Giving a customer something amazing to switch.

But, I don’t think it’s feasible. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have tried and failed to crack the nut of competing with the iPhone. It’d be way too costly.

If anyone could… maybe Tesla. But, no one is displacing Apple like they did to Blackberry.

Highlighted this yesterday on futures but im highlighting it today on SPY to make it even more clear. The blue arrows show what looks like a possible top on SPY which should lead to a sell off. I will be looking for an interaction with SPY at 378 support (now resistance after hours). This is the key level that separates the green and grey channels. A breakdown under this support and back into the green channel would signal to me a retest of 360s is coming before we reach 390 resistance. 

This will be the key pivot level to watch tomorrow. If we reject there in the morning or close back below that support of 378 (at this point we do have a gap to fill) then I will be looking for a further sell off next week leading into FOMC and with FOMC.

I will touch on this more tomorrow in the weekly TA but overall SPY, Futures and Apple weekly charts are setting up for a massive failed breakout gravestone doji which should lead to a pretty nice sell off next week. The one caveat with this is that FOMC is next week and that can be a wild card for sure. If it wasn’t for FOMC id play puts for sure but I will sit cash most likely unless something looks really good. 

Key support- 378.8 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3 -&gt; 370.5

Key resistance- 380 -&gt; 383.1

If you read last nights TA I said that futes most likely would go up and touch 3870 before it rejected just like happened back first week of October. That would then lead to a sell off and we would see a further sell off intraday. Well with this drop after hours its setting up perfectly to see the next leg down leading into FOMC next week. 

With that 3870 rejection and now sitting back under key 3805 support I would look for the 3600s before I look for 3900 again.

Well there it is… Apple missed on pretty much everything but china rev lol. So that’s not very good.. currently only down 4% after hours though. The golden boy lives! The call will be interesting for sure especially since they never give guidance anyways.

To be honest though earnings is a whole none issue for me. Apple today broke through key red bull channel support. This is the same channel that SPY and Futures are holding so far. I will look regardless of what happens for further downside next week. This could be the fuel that markets need to see Apple retest its 52week low finally. If and when that happens I will believe that the temporary bottom is in. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 142.8 -&gt; 141.1

And then there was tesla! So this is one that I am actually most excited about tomorrow at open. I think Tesla is poised for a really nice sell off tomorrow and next week. Tesla went on pretty much a 4 day bounce rally this week and established a super impressive rising wedge and bull channel. However, we say today that we broke out at open touching and rejecting key 234 resistance and then it dumped from there. If you caught that move it was one heck of nice win (granted not as nice as the call win yesterday). With this rising wedge broken I am looking to short tesla at open tomorrow most likely. I think if market remains are red as it is right now and Apple drops tomorrow and the rest of tech including SPY finally then we will see Tesla test that bull channel support. 

Tesla has established a really nice 230 to 205 consolidation channel. I am using the 230 area as a nice opportunity for puts and the 205 area for a nice opportunity for calls. 

Support- 219.2 -&gt; 215.6

Resistance- 225 -&gt; 230 -&gt; 234

Besides the VIX being detached from reality the one thing I am looking at is that we bounced off that previous support of 27 today and closed with a dragonfly doji. This should result in a nice retracement tomorrow which should also result in a nice dump of SPY tomorrow. 

10% challenge- 

Well after an all around fucky day… just found out my daughter who I had to go pick up this morning during opening hours actually has the VID… my son who I picked up from school at normal time walked out with an ice pack on his head cause he fell off the swing and probs has a concussion… our household be falling apart I tell ya. 

But I played Meta overnight for a decent win…

Intraday today didn’t get to play much. I ended up closing my level to level spy play EOD during PH cause I was supposed to leave to take my kid to the doctor… had I held that 1.6% win it would had hit 80% profits during that 15 minute drop after hours…

289,1666902610,yf2hmj,1,"**Positives**: Let's keep it real, Elon deserves a lot of credit for all of his accomplishments, positivity brought into the world, a vision for a future and trying to turn humanity into a multi-planetary species. 

**Character**: With all that being said, he is kind of an annoying human. If he wasn't rich, wasn't good at engineering, wasn't changing the world, no one would like him personally. Mother of his children and x wife is all the character reference you need. 

**Interest Rates:** With the interest rate environment drastically different, and the TSLA bros starting to get underwater, his magic touch is wearing off. Just look at the TSLA chart YTD and try to feel positive about that. You can't. 

**Comps**: Kanye was the greatest rapper of all time. Trump was the greatest president of all time (not saying I agree, but some do). Elon is the greatest engineer of all time. No one really cares about their accomplishments if they don't comply with the social fabric of the new woke left America. It really doesn't matter about facts, only about feels. Not sure Elon gives people the good vibes he used to. Trump, Kanye, Elon are the three free speech musketeers - two out of these three are officially cancelled already. 

**Annoying**: Sink into twitter is a bitch move. It mocks the establishment, mocks the left. He threatens to fire 75% of the staff - even if they deserve it, this is a very ""non left"" thing to do. 

**Women**: He keeps impregnating women and then leaving them. Lefties don't like that. He impregnates his employees as well. I am sure there are some settlements out there he has made, or an abortion he paid for, just a matter of time until someone attacks him. 

**Anti-Vax Narative:** He is anti vax in some regard. He believes in science for sure, but isn't afraid to criticize WHO, Fauci, Biden, The Government, Big Pharma or other players on the left. 

**Capitalism is Bad Now:** He is anti worker, pro capitalist. Expects people to sleep in the factory, return to work, do his bidding or be unemployed. 

**Big Tech is Bad Now:** Both left and right hate “big tech” - this is one of the only things that politicians agree on. Social media is bad, consumer privacy should be protected, tech companies shouldn't have more power than politicians. 

**Disrespects the Government:** He smokes weed on Joe Rohan with privileged defense contracts. This is just another disrespectful move to bite the hand that feeds him. He shits on Biden, Biden shits on him. Elon drops memes like he is 14 years old mocking the establishment, and he has a very large following - that makes him a target. 

**Indian Giver:** He demands the Gov pay for his starlink service for ukraine when the gov, nor ukraine, never asked him to save the day like that. You don't invite your friend to dinner, then complain and ask them to pay for it after the fact. Indian giving is a bitch move. 

**Conspiracy Theorist:** He promotes Russel Brands youtube channel. Sure MSM is total bullshit, but that doesn't make RB a source of truth. If you promote stuff like that, you are playing for the wrong team. The team that gets cancelled.  

**\[Redacted\]:** His is king of ""that which can't be named here"" the bros are and their coins are not doing so hot right now. Powell actively wants them gone. The social media influencers who promoted these pump and dump coins are facing their time in court, Elon is the main dude pumping.

**Not Green Enough:** The ""green"" left is starting to be alienated by Elon specifically. He is too rich, too successful, to capitalist. Lets not forget the cars themselves are not exactly ""green"" to produce and the whole idea of EVs being ""more green"" than ICE cars is a u argument that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. 

**Lack of Immunity:** He doesn't have ""founder control"" of TSLA. He actually can be removed, not saying he will or that he should, just stating it is possible. 

**False Promises:** He has a pending FSD lawsuit because - well, FSD is a complete lie. Its not even close and yet it is marketed AND SOLD as available. Many hundreds of thousands of people paid 10k for FSD, and it simply doesn't exist.  Where is the cyber truck? What is the deal with a robot 10 years behind Boston Dynamics and Honda? Bullet proof glass? Semi truck deliveries? Bigger than Apple and Aramco? 

**Free Speech:** The Twitter purchase removes the ""town square"" from the free speech arena. It is now private speech, controlled by one individual. It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the ""real"" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.  

I had another post on [TSLA as a stock losing its growth trajectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and I recommended [everyone sell calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) which everyone criticized but turned into gains for me. 

I have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of ""person"" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today. 

What do you guys think the chances are of Elon being socially ""cancelled"" - or there at least being an attempt - in the next 12 months? Is his popularity and influence fading along with his market cap? Can Elon be cancelled?",Elon Will Get Cancelled Soon,1.0,2022-10-27 20:30:10

292,1666870330,yepjnp,1,"Gogoro is a battery swapping company for two wheelers which has accumulated over 500,000 customers in their BaaS network. Yearly revenue is around 400 million USD and almost fully coming from Taiwan market.

As a head up to all interested, they are on November 3 revealing their plans for India. As far as we know Gogoro is making co-operation with Indian company Hero Motocorp which is one of the largest two-wheeler manufacturers in the world and also with Foxconn which is world's largest technology manufacturer and service provider (which has indicated that they would like to build the battery swapping network in India preferably with Gogoro). The potential would be enormous in case they success with go to market.

[https://www.bikedekho.com/news/breaking-gogoro-to-reveal-plans-for-india-on-november-3-15259](https://www.bikedekho.com/news/breaking-gogoro-to-reveal-plans-for-india-on-november-3-15259)

Let's talk about the elephant in the room first. Taiwan and China relations are not the best at the moment. This is generating a substantion geopolitical risk for Gogoro. The ones who suspect that China will invade Taiwan anytime soon should stop reading at this point and skip to the next thread. However, the ones who think that China is far too busy with other topics at the moment than trying to invade Taiwan and risking their already poor economical performance with sanctions are free to check this opportunity out.

As a typical SPAC company Gogoro's journey in Nasdaq has been a bumpy ride down (with very low volume). In addition to overall SPAC sentiment, geopolitical risks, covid restrictions and challenges in first overseas expansion efforts in China the financial performance is relatively good. The company has a solid revenue stream, finance muscles for expansion and increasing userbase (sticky users who pay monthly subscriptions). There is room to grow in Taiwan (population 25 million) but main opportunity lies in countries like India, Indonesia and other south east asian countires with high scooter usage.

Gogoro's product is second to none in the market. In industry reviews Gogoro is in top position in battery swapping for two wheelers. I've been checking out multiple competitor products and my honest subjective opinion is that Gogoro simply seems to be the best. Marketing material etc. is top notch like Apple or Tesla for example. Other competitor's products looks like some garage engineering start ups :) As a clarification the main idea for Gogoro is to build battery swapping network so that other manufacturers could use the Powered By Gogoro Network (a bit like Android). They already have 10+ manufactures onboard.

Maybe the most serious competitor is Gachaco (I always need to Google the name as I can't remember it). It's based on Honda's technology and looks pretty decent. There are also plenty of companies planning to build a scooter based on that product. However, just by checking the product and marketing material I'm not fully convinced. Compared to Gogoro there are additional steps when switching the batteries and the overall marketing material isn't so good and appealing to public (my personal opinion). They have launced small pilots in Japan and India but there obviously seems to be a very long road ahead of them to improve their product and there surely is lot to catch up with Gogoro which has around 10 years experience of finetuning the product and services (AI etc.). Also even if the Gachaco would grow their market share then there still is a room for couple of players. It is also nice to know that scooters can have multiple battery variations as for example Yamaha has scooters in Taiwan which are based on Gogoro technology.

CEO Horace Luke who has background in innovating Xbox and succesfully launcing HMD phones in the past is very capable guy. He has a passion to sustainability and no suprise he was the one who initiated battery swapping for two wheelers in the first place by inventing the products. Btw, his name is in many of the patents so really this guy knows what he is doing and is really hands in the sand guy with can do attitude.

No doubt Gogoro is a risky bet but the potential is also enormous. In a long run two wheeler's sustainability topic in big cities has to be addressed in a one way or another and battery swapping sounds much more practical than hundreds of millions of individual users charging with wires. Gogoro might or might not be the rainmaker in the industry in the next decade but it has a good chance. Successful India expansion would surely ensure a payday for all $GGR investors (especially for the ones who have loaded up shares with $3 prices). For the ones who prefer less risk then it might be good idea to follow up the financial performance for some time as you can always jump on board a bit later.

I own plenty of Gogoro shares and I'm willing to take the risk at this point. However, I'm not a financial advisor so make your own dd :)",Gogoro $GGR is revealing its plans for India on Nov 3,1.0,2022-10-27 11:32:10

302,1666822917,yeasba,1,"Well today was one wild day that’s for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a “level to level” play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren’t stopping out too soon (this is why I didn’t chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key resistance- 385 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple…. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough.

You know those little maps that say “you are here” when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak… apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover… its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3770

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn’t very bullish… 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing… technically Tesla beat but missed revenue… its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before… But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don’t know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 145.5

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today… So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -&gt; 214.4 -&gt; 209.9 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234

As if the VIX couldn’t become anymore detached from reality… we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers… however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That’s really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn’t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it’s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

306,1666794617,ydzj7f,1,"Elon Musk told the banks that are partially funding his $44 billion Twitter acquisition he plans to close the deal by Friday, a deadline set by Delaware state court judge, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, as the world’s wealthiest man finally seems set on purchasing the social network after a very public case of buyer’s remorse.

* Musk broke the news on a Monday video call with the bankers, according to Bloomberg, citing sources close to the deal.
* Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Barclays are the primary financiers, each committing at least $2.5 billion in debt financing for the deal.
* The banks will set aside the cash by Thursday, according to Bloomberg.
* Musk had until Friday to complete the acquisition, or he would be forced to face Twitter in a trial at Delaware’s Chancery Court as part of the company’s lawsuit to push through the deal.

 KEY BACKGROUND

In total, Musk secured $12.5 billion in loans from the banks, with the rest of the funds coming from his own horde of cash, which has swelled as he sells tens of billions of dollars in Tesla stock, and a slew of equity investors, including billionaires Marc Andreesen and Larry Ellison and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. In April, Twitter accepted Musk’s unsolicited offer to take the company private at $54.20 per share before the parties became entangled in a six-month legal tug-of-war, with Musk trying to pull out of the deal as Twitter sued him to close the acquisition.

SURPRISING FACT

The banks plan to keep the $13 billion in debt for the time being after facing a likely $500 million loss on any sale, according to Wall Street Journal and Reuters, a rare step for debt financiers. That would make this the largest stalled deal ever, according to Business Insider.

CRUCIAL QUOTE

“They’re big boys, they can deal with it,” JPMorgan Chase Dimon told CNBC earlier this month when asked about his rivals potentially taking a massive loss with Twitter.

The issue we have now is that MSFT and Google earnings apparently did not go very well and that is causing a pretty significant red after hours. As I am writing this SPY is down about -0.9%. 

We were able today to push pretty green and we broke through the last resistance of the bear channel level from the August sell off. That is pretty bullish. With this earnings miss we could look for a healthy pull back to reconfirm support after a pretty large 3 day green move up. Or this could end up being the next peak of the bear market rally and we start our descent downward to the 350s/ 360s. For me until we break that red bull channel support I will remain bullish. I will also be watching closely for what we do at that 378.2 support level. Tomorrow could actually have a really impressive red day and still maintain the red bull channel. 

Key support- 382.3 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 378.1 -&gt; 374.4

Looks like futures was able to cover no mans land as I called it yesterday which ranged from 3805 to 3875. However, now this daily candle is opened below that level and we will look to see what happens next. Daily 50ema support lies at 3828 for overnight and tomorrow. 3925 remains the bear channel resistance that dates back to the August top.

Apple continues to look quite stout and strong despite the rest of the Market. Apple was able to make a move all the way up to its 100ema today falling just short of closing above it. The 100ema and 200ema now lie well within range of being retaken. Apple taking the 100/200ema would be exetremly bullish not only technical but sentiment wise.

I dare say I was impressed with tesla today! It perfectly hit my first target of 223 (unfortunately I closed my calls way too early). However, today we saw tesla once again hold support and actually had one of the most bullish days I have seen in a very long time. However, in the end it fell just short of 222.5 resistance. We have a nice diamond pattern formed here where you can see Tesla rejected on its upside move today. Tesla still could see a retracement but it is showing some signs of bullishness after it established 206 as support. 

Tomorrow or later this week I will need to see Tesla break through that blue bear channel in order to believe in a bigger move up to 230s. If we continue to see the trend of sell off followed by a rogue green day that only brings further downside and we close back under 205 at any point I will be looking at puts. 

Key support- 215.1 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.7

Terrible timing… but the VIX finally sold off. We finally broke the bull channel and we even retested that key 28.4 level, however, we ended up bouncing pretty hard off of it. With these earnings coming in and this hugely red after hours it will be interesting to see what the VIX does tomorrow. 

10% challenge- 

Overall a great day that was heavily support by some level to level plays I made.

Granted especially Tesla which went on to almost triple the profits from where I closed them I had some pretty stout wins this morning on my level to level wins. With earnings coming out tonight and being gone at the EOD I decided it was best to sit cash gang overnight. I will be looking to see where thing settle tomorrow by EOD and will look for some level to level plays there.

I was able to play a few level to level plays intraday today for some smaller profits. I got greedy on them but didn’t let them go red. I suspect tomorrow to be able to have a few of these level to level plays to play again. SPY lately really has been respecting key pivot support/ resistance levels.

311,1666706222,yd5hf5,1," Morgan Stanley cut its base case price target on Overweight-rated Tesla (TSLA) to $330 from $350 to allow for a greater margin of safety in terms of supply chain and incremental pressures from FX headwinds, input cost inflation, startup costs. The firm also pointed to the risk of profitability in China if political tension heats up and warned Tesla could see some demand destruction if the global economy worsens.

""While initial signs of a slowing consumer present itself in shrinking order-to-delivery times/reduced order backlots, we believe Tesla’s increasingly large size today and in the forecast makes it susceptible to what could be some profound swings in consumer strength and EV affordability,"" updated analyst Adam Jonas. Morgan Stanley kept its long-term TSLA unit volume forecast of 3.2M units by 2025 and 7.7M by 2030 in place for now.

Morgan Stanley pulled in its automotive gross margin and cash flow for Tesla (TSLA) to account some of the headwinds, including ramping two Gigafactories on separate continents.

On capital allocation, Jonas said the firm is not enthusiastic about share buybacks from TSLA given the other growth opportunities the electric vehicle maker has at its disposal and the importance of building up cash reserves to maintain a self-financing status throughout a range of uncertain economic environments.

Putting the Morgan Stanley caution in perspective, the new PT of $330 still reps more than 60% upside for TSLA from its current level. Morgan Stanley also has a bull case PT of $500 on the EV stock and bear case price target of $150.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were down 1.98% at 3:05 p.m. on a rough day overall for U.S. companies with exposure in China.

313,1666699209,yd32pp,1,"Tesla on Monday cut prices for its electric vehicles in China, a sign of intensifying competition in the world’s largest car market that caused a drop in the company’s shares.

Tesla’s Chinese website was offering the Model 3 for a starting price of ￥265,900 (or $36,600), including government subsidies, a 5% reduction. The Model Y vehicle was advertised at ￥288,900 (or $39,766), a cut by as much as 9%. Upon the price cuts post, the car maker’s Chinese website once couldn’t be reached as too many visitors flooded in within a short time.

The price cuts posted yesterday were the first time by Tesla in China this year and came after Tesla began offering limited incentives to buyers who opted for its insurance last month. For Tesla buyers who got deliveries since September, they received a subsidy of $8,000 (or $1,140)  if they chose to purchase insurance in a Tesla store, according to Chinese media The Paper.

The reason for the reduction is clear: The electric car leader is striving to boost its deliveries throughout the last quarter in 2022. Its best-seller Model Y now is offered within the subsidy threshold of ￥300,000 and wins over more customers who are hesitant between Tesla and other Chinese brands. 

As Tesla declares the ‘price war’ in China,  reversing a trend of increases across the industry, the EV giant is determined to release an upbeat financial report for 2022, with delivery target of at least 1.5 million. That is, China, which accounts for more than half of its deliveries, is out of question a key market for the Austin, Texas-based firm.

After Tesla’s prices decided to drop in China, the car maker’s shares declined more than 7% at $198 before recovering a little as the price reductions reinforced fears among investors that the company’s profitability and dominance of the EV market were threatened by slowing economic growth and increased competition.

[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) shares slipped in premarket trade Monday after the company cut the price of some of its cars in China.

Shares of the electric car maker were down around 3% in New York before the market open.

Tesla slashed the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China, one of the company's most critical markets.

The starting price for the Model 3 sedan was reduced to 265,900 Chinese yuan ($36,615) from 279,900 yuan. The Model Y sports utility vehicle now costs 288,900 yuan versus the previous price of 316,900 yuan.

Tesla's cuts partly reverse some of the price increases the company was [forced to carry out earlier this year in China and the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/15/tesla-hikes-car-prices-in-the-us-china-after-musk-inflation-warning.html) on the back of rising raw material costs.

 

[Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/), CEO of Tesla, [warned in March](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/17/tesla-hikes-china-made-model-y-price-again-by-more-than-2000.html) that his electric car company is ""seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials &amp; logistics.""

The price cuts also come after Musk said he sees elements of a recession in China.

""China is experiencing a recession of sorts"" mostly in the property markets, Musk said last week.

Tesla [delivered](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2022-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html) 343,000 vehicles for the quarter ended Sept. 30, missing analyst expectations. The company does not break out how many cars were delivered in China. Tesla also [missed analyst expectation on revenue in the third quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/tesla-tsla-earnings-q3-2022-.html).

However in September, the China Passenger Car Association reported Tesla delivered 83,135 China-made electric vehicles, a monthly record for the company. Tesla has a huge Gigafactory in the Chinese city of Shanghai which it completed upgrades on earlier this year.

Still, the price cuts come in the [face of rising competition](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/byd-shares-jump-after-chinese-ev-maker-forecasts-surging-profits.html) for Tesla in China from domestic firms such as Warren Buffett-backed [BYD](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/1211-HK/) as well as upstarts [Nio](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NIO/) and [Xpeng](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XPEV/).

Wall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market’s most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy’s health.

On the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) – which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index – will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.

A bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

 

Earnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.

For this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.

Earnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn’t leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla’s revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

 

On Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.

Strength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback’s 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.

That headwind is expected to show up in Amazon’s results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate’s revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that “foreign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs"" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.

  

For Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted “demand has held up better than expected in recent months.”

Meta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech’s 72-hour earnings rollout.

In economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings – which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER’s panel of economists must officially declare a recession.

Economic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

 

According to Pantheon Economics’ Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.

“But the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,” Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",Yahoo Finance Big Tech earnings and GDP data,1.0,2022-10-24 02:46:56

I would like to discuss with you the real value of BYD.

After checking the financial figures https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/byddf/financials I find this company more financial healthy and serious then Tesla. 

Except the car manufacturing the company also offers their batteries to companies like Toyota which one of the largest car manufacturers worldwide; https://en.byd.com/news/byd-toyota-enter-agreement-to-jointly-develop-battery-electric-vehicles/

The company has started their expansion to the European market and even the biggest car rental company Sixt has ordered 100,000 cars from the Chinese manufacturer:

&amp;#x200B;

The company as of 21 October 2022 is valued at $649.51bn, although shares have fallen from $400 to $215 since the start of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their Q3 for the year was released on 19 October 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue was up 56% to $21,454m (compared to last year), while net profit was up 103.5% to $3,292m. This means its net margin improved from 11.8% to 15.3%. 

&amp;#x200B;

The short-term liquidity (current liabilities/current assets) of Tesla is high, at a current rate of 68.4%, despite improving from 72.2% this time last year. Investors will want to see this rate drop below 50% as soon as possible and show a tighter control of liabilities. Rising interest rates will not coincide well for company's with high liabilities, although rising net profit margins may provide optimism that its liquidity will continue improving. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current assets increased 44% to $35,990m, while current liabilities increased 36.3% to $24,611m. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla's long-term liquidity (total liabilities/total assets) is at a much healthier rate than its short-term liquidity, having dipped to 46.5% in the Q3. This shows that the company is in a tighter financial position in the short-term period (one year), than its long-term.  

&amp;#x200B;

Total assets increased 28.7% to $74,426m since last year, while total liabilities were up at a slower rate of 12.3% to $34,575m. Long-term liquidity has improved from 53.2% to 46.5% during that timeframe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Total cash levels have also been steadily increasing since last year, which is impressive when liquidity is simultaneously decreasing, which again may be thanks to rising net profit margins. Total cash increased 31.1% to $21,107m, which made up 61.1% of the company's total liabilities.

The way the government sees it that the prince of Saudi Arabia and businessman in China would be helping fund musks deal and that presents a national security risk. This will definitely boost Tesla stock price next week. It’s not the first time the government has had to step in and kill a deal. What also helps this is how much Elon has talked with Putin and his tweets about Ukraine. Elon has also said several times that he would turn Twitter into a wechat.  Wechat was banned previously by the government and is still scrutinized heavily. The government will probably intervene or delay the purchase because there’s only 5 days left and they would need time to present all the security risk.",Twitter deal my be done if government decides it’s a national security risk.,1.0,2022-10-23 05:20:12

337,1666452966,yaqtuz,1,"I'll keep it simple for you regards:

It says right at the end of the TWTR financing deal in purest blackest ink that if the deal doesn't close by Oct 20th, the banks can walk away from the deal. 

For those that can read: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922048128/tm2213229d1\_ex99-c.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922048128/tm2213229d1_ex99-c.htm)

Regardless of Musk's interest in the deal at this point, there's a good chance banks really really don't want to do this deal. It's a crap deal, that's obvious to even somebody as regarded as me.

Ultimately then, they would want to move the debt off their balance sheets as quickly as possible. Two options: they already have sold the debt. Now I know nothing about banks, but I assume this is unlikely, considering they haven't given anybody money for anything anything yet. Option two: they are currently trying to sell the debt. If it's two - now is a terrible time, with rising interest rates and a low appetite for junk bonds. There's reports coming out that they're having a hard time selling the junk bonds that would finance this deal to other regards. 

So - if banks don't want to do it/cant do it without taking huge losses, why can't they just back out? The date for them to get out of their contractual obligations is Oct 20th. That's passed. The date the twitter deal has to close is the 28th.

If banks walk, musk will owe 1Bn. Much smaller than the possible billions he could lose on this deal. So it's somewhat in his best interest as well to let the banks walk without a fight, in that case, he just points the finger at them and says ""aw shucks, I guess I couldn't do it after all"". He got to sell billions in Tesla stock without crashing the price too hard, and ultimately comes out on top. 

So my thinking is - If we don't hear about things moving to close early this week I think the play is to LOAD up on 7DTE far far out of the money puts. Like I mean balls to the wall YOLO level puts. If the deal falls through you could see twitter go to $30 or below.

Am I just extra regarded? Am I missing something entirely? Why is nobody talking about this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because this seems really obvious to me -which is probably why it's one of the dumbest plays possible.

TLDR: Tell me why I'm regarded.

My reason for yolo? Well i'm a long term bull, but Tesla is down 33% because of of fucking twitter? With NO rebound. If we consider the macro, NASDAQ &amp; SPY only down 15% in same period so this is all bullshit. Everyone literally **knows** Tesla will execute on a $30k car at scale with high margins and everyone knows at least ONE of his many startups (FSD, Optimus etc) will be realised. I really do believe, everyone is ""playing along"" to bring the price down JUST to buy in cheaper because they missed the boat in 2020, all while everyone else still has plausible deniability that this *might not be* a generational company, so AS SOON AS Twitter pressure lefts next friday, this thing will explode to the upside.

... I admit this thought process may be completely regarded. If Elon starts selling next week I will have to come to terms with the fact that my position will say something crazy like -50% and I will not sleep easy next week. I will have to hold until afterwards because then the price *should* skyrocket immediately after. So this literally cannot go tits up as long as I have the balls to hodl

I was 100% not expecting a green day and let me tell you if someone woulda told me that we would go from a -1% pre market to closing at 2.43% green today I woulda laughed in their faces. From the lowest point to the highest point SPY moved $12.3 up. 

So where does that leave us? 

Well lets take a look at a few MACRO things first here. Next week is the week before FOMC (November 2nd). Now generally if we look at the previous FOMCS 5 out of the 6 last pre-FOMC weeks finished green averaging about a -4.41% drop. However, if we look at July you can see it was the only week where SPY finished green all year. What was the difference? Well that was back when they started the fed pivot/ inflation is getting better narrative. So I ask myself… are we in a inflation sucks, feds never going to stop hiking environment OR are we in an inflation is peaking and feds going to slow the big hikes soon? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don’t like to include so many tweets in my TA but I find these to be VERY important. So lets break this down here… Next week is the week before FOMC. November 2nd will be FOMC. Followed by the next CPI reading the following week on November 10th. 

So what does that mean. Today Bullard and Daly pretty much said without saying it and the WSJ article said that the fed is most likely going to do a 75bps hike on November 2nd. Once that hike is done in order to not over due it with rate hikes and cause a market crash/ collapse the economy they are most likely going to “pullback” to a 25 or 50bps hike. While this is NOT a pause what this is… is a clear slowing of rate hikes from the mouths of the fed themselves. This is one of the first times we have actually heard them discuss slowing or a lesser rate hike. 

Why is this all important and how does it effect next week? Well the fed is now in a quiet period. What does that mean? That means no fed member can speak publicly to the press or say anything else until FOMC happens. They just left us with some extreme bullish news (even more bullish then when we rallied back in July-August). 

My thoughts are this… next week we rally on this news and expectations of a 75bps hike followed by a 25-50bps hike in December. The week of FOMC we rally when JPOW confirms this news. Then this is when it gets tricky (and I don’t have the CPI consensus numbers yet to give an accurate probability of what CPI will be) but there is a chance that CPI will miss again and even if it does miss there is a chance that we will see markets rally instead of dropping just like the Septembers. Why? Because markets know that even if the CPI is bad the FED is going to slow its rate hikes. So unless JPOW says something different on November 2nd I would be bullish for the new two weeks minimum.

Looking at the SPY daily chart we actually have a really nice W pattern forming. What I am seeing is that today should have been our chance to retest the lower lows of the 350s however we rallied instead. With this daily candle being a two day (almost 3 day) bullishly engulfing candle with a double bottom off 365.1 from here I would expect upside. We have been trading in this grey channel for a full month now. The key resistance for this channel lies at 378.2 and the overall bear channel (blue dotted line) resistance from the August top lies at 378.8 from Monday. If we break through and close over those levels then in the next week or two we should look for a retest of the 390 level. However, if we reject that 378.2 level then I would be looking for us to maintain this grey channel and puts would be the most probable play. 

Daily supports- 370.5 -&gt; 365.2 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.5

Daily resistance- 374.3 -&gt; 378.2 -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.3

On the SPY weekly we have a very V double bottom forming and we closed back over the weekly 200ema for the first time in a month. However we did fall just short of breaking through and closing over the daily 8ema. While we are still in this black bear channel right now that dates back to August. If SPY breaks through 374.3 at any point Monday or next week we will be through the bear channel resistance and that will open up the upside with a target of 382 to 385. 

Weekly support- 363.7 -&gt; 357 -&gt; 348

Weekly resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 385.4

Looking at the futures daily chart I feel like the overall V bottom is even more clear. This was a fairly bullish close as the futures daily candle not only backtested and held support at 3675 to form a double bottom it also fully bull engulfed the previous 3 trading days and closed over key resistance of 3760. 

Futures will look to target 3880 next week as the next major daily resistance level. 

Daily support- 3708 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3586

Daily resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3875

Futures weekly also has a nice V bottom but more notable had a major support area now at 3590 that has been held for 4 weeks in a row now. Futures weekly too closed over the weekly 200ema ofr the first time in a month but did fall short of breaking through its bear channel resistance and daily 8ema. However, unless we see futures Monday open down below 3690 (-2%+ red open) and hold that level all week we will see the futures weekly pattern broken through. This will open up the upside to retest the next resistance level at 3900 which notably is just over the JPM collar of 3870. 

Weekly support- 3705 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3500

Weekly resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3890

On Apples daily I had called out earlier in the week that Apple was through its August bear channel resistance. However, as soon as it poked through it sold off. I was bearish based on that sell off, however, Apple has found some heavy support on its daily 8ema and at this point has broken through 145.4 resistance and wicked over the next major resistance of 147.5. With a close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September (SPY also closed over its daily 20ema) this is a pretty bullish sign moving forward. 

I will be watching that key red v bottom support very closely next week. The next major resistance level to break on the daily is 149.3.

Daily support- 145.5 -&gt; 142.9 -&gt; 141 -&gt; 138.2

Daily resistance- 147.6 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.7

The Apple weekly bear channel has also not been broken yet. However, with 3 week strong support put in at that key 138.2 support level and a nice v bottom support bounce… Apple was able to close over its weekly 8ema for the first time since the week of August 22nd. I will be looking for apple to test that bear channel resistance and break through it next week. Much like SPY unless Apple opens and holds red below 147.3 all week it will take out that bear channel resistance and open the upside. 

Apple posts earnings on October 27th also to keep in mind. 

Weekly support- 141.2 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 133.4

Now Tesla is the wild child of the bunch. I actually had even mentioned in my TA yesterday that I almost was convinced of buying longer DTE calls on tesla because of how hard it bounced and how well it held that 205 support area. Well today reconfirmed my bullish suspicions. I am looking for Tesla to break through that bear channel Monday and see a bigger push up. After putting its 52week low in this week and being absolutely beaten down for the last month straight… Tesla is poised for a big bounce if the markets bounce. 

Daily support- 206.3 -&gt; 196

Daily resistance- 215 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 233.6

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla weekly finally for the first time in 5 weeks broke its resistance line. With a nice bounce off 205 I am looking for a bigger push up. While this is not a true double bottom I am looking for that 205 support level to hold. There is always a chance we could retest it early next week but I believe Tesla will seek upside from here as long as the rest of the market is doing the same. 

Tesla has a pretty big no mans land from 223 to 255 area. After the May/ June low it spent a lot of time consolidating there before it finally pushed for the 300s. I would expect tesla to attempt to close somewhere inside that range next week. 

Weekly support- 205 -&gt; 191.9 -&gt; 167.8 

Weekly resistance- 223 -&gt; 254.7

As you can see with SPY, Apple and Tesla I am attempting to add some Level to Level plays (as I call them) into my trading. I have been absolutely killing it with scalps lately but I see an opportunity as of late to enter some longer DTE plays and play these key level breakouts and break downs. I look forward to incorporating them as time goes on, but also recognizing that not every day or week will have level to level play.

And then there was the VIX. Now you would think with SPY moving $12+ from pre market to HOD and having a nearly 2.5% green day that we would see the VIX massively unwind right? Well you would be wrong. The craziest thing is that as SPY rose the 2nd half of the day the VIX actually rose with it. Now I have said this numerous times but I really just don’t believe the VIX anymore. However, the key takeaway is we close below the daily 8ema and below the daily 20ema for the first time since middle of September. However, we did not lose the bull channel support just yet. This is the last piece to the bullish puzzle. 

10% challenge-

Overall a pretty good day for me today and a pretty great week overall. Not my best win rate by far but overall $$ and % gains was great this week. 

As I was saying below is an example of some of the LEVEL to LEVEL plays I am going to start incorporating into my own trading that I hope allows me outside of my scalps to capture more gains and more moves.

Compare that to the USA with 2.1% lithium and 0% rare earths. 

China has 30x the lithium capacity of the United States. Is China gonna keep selling lithium and rare earths to an American company, or will they try to cripple the US economy and keep everything domestic in response?

China has lax environmental regulations which is why their mining industry is so big.

Taking a look at SPY daily we got a really nice head and shoulders pattern forming. I mentioned that big run up we just had looked a lot like October 3rd and 4th. If that is true (which I do believe) then today was October 6th and we should push down from here. 

I am looking for a retest by next week of 356-360 support. If that support breaks then we could be looking for a new 52 week low. 

Keep in mind that next week is the week before FOMC meeting and generally speaking 5 out of the last 6 weeks before FOMC have been red averaging a -3% to -5% drop.

Tesla has been on an absolute wild sell off for the last month with no end in sight. We found support at that 205 range today bouncing off of it twice today. I was actually a little impressed to see Tesla bounce how it did this morning as I really thought we might just breach through 200 today.

Honestly the VIX is telling a mixed story here. It doesn’t quite want to sell off, however it doesn’t quite want to rip up either. Today we saw spy close almost -1% and yet the VIX actually unwound slightly. 

I am still holding bearish until that key 28.4 level is broken.

* Apple and Aramco are the world's top two companies by market capitalization.
* The combined market cap of Aramco and Apple is six times that of Tesla, at today's stock price. 

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, said on Wednesday his electric vehicle company could become more valuable than the world's two largest companies — Apple and Saudi Aramco.

The combined market capitalization of tech giant Apple and Saudi Arabian state energy giant Aramco is around $4.4 trillion today. In comparison, Tesla's market cap is about $690 billion. This means Tesla would have to grow roughly six times its current size to catch up.

""I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,"" said Musk, according to a transcript of Tesla's earnings call on October 19. He acknowledged it'll be tough, but it can be achieved with ""a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.""

Musk made the ambitious statement on Wednesday after Tesla reported record revenues of $21.45 billion in the third quarter of 2022 — although it fell short of the $21.96 billion analysts were estimating, per IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also posted a profit of $3.29 billion in the quarter running from July to September — just under a record profit of $3.3 billion reported in the first quarter of this year.

Although $TSLA did quickly recover from last week’s close below the June low, the bounce over the past 3 sessions leading up to earnings has been on diminishing volumes, warning of a potential lack of bullish conviction in this attempted move higher. With broader market seemingly returning to a risk-off mood, if the stock closes even lower this week, sellers may end up targeting a downside breakout from the psychologically key $200 level. 

However, it is worth noting that the bounce from right around the June lows in the aftermarket does point to demand remaining around these levels. If $TSLA can continue to hold this support heading into the weekend, it could potentially form a base to rally from when momentum in the broader market swings back in favour of buyers.

Tesla plans a share buyback program between $5 billion et $10 billion for 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk took out the carrot. 

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO of Tesla  (TSLA)  tried on October 19 to reassure the electric vehicle maker's shareholders after a completely disastrous first half of October for Tesla shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla shares have lost 16.3% since September 30, which translates into a decline in market value of approximately $135 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

The decline is likely to continue, given the group's mixed results in the third quarter and cautious forecast for the whole of 2022. 

&amp;#x200B;

""As we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year. Although we are tracking supply chain risks, which are beyond our control,"" Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn told analysts during the earnings' call. ""On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year .""

&amp;#x200B;

He added: ""This means that again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4. And those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination and Q1 \[of 2023\]."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla should therefore produce nearly 1.4 million vehicles in 2022 and deliver over 1.4 million units. It would be a record in both cases, but the firm had hoped to deliver 1.5 million vehicles in 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

'Meaningful Buyback' Tesla posted a third-quarter net profit of $3.3 billion on revenue of $21.45 billion, the company said on October 19. Despite a 56% increase, revenues came below the $21.96 billion anticipated by analysts.

&amp;#x200B;

Faced with this avalanche of not very reassuring news, Musk pulled out the bazooka. Indeed, the whimsical CEO indicated that Tesla had discussed a massive share buyback program, intended to remunerate the shareholders by boosting the share price.

&amp;#x200B;

This share buyback program would be between $5 billion and $10 billion, the tech tycoon told analysts during the earnings' call.

&amp;#x200B;

""We debated the buyback idea extensively at board level,"" Musk said. ""The board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. We want to work through the right process to do a buyback. But it is certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 \[billion\] to $10 billion even in the downside scenario of next year. Even if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 \[billion\] to $10 billion buyback.""

&amp;#x200B;

He added that it ""is obviously pending board review and approval.”

&amp;#x200B;

The tech tycoon, however, seems optimistic that this will be done.

&amp;#x200B;

“So it’s likely that we will do some meaningful buyback,” he concluded.

&amp;#x200B;

The announcement also comes a few months after Tesla carried out a stock split. In recent days, investors have been speculating about a buyback on Twitter where Musk is very present.

&amp;#x200B;

""Tesla is having PE ratio compression that can be solved only by buyback and/or by 2x earnings increase,"" a Twitter user suggested on October 3.","Elon Musk has a huge gift for Tesla investors, do you think this will win the market over?",1.0,2022-10-20 02:06:02
379,1666228586,y8k6uk,1,"Need to see what the non-adjusted eps was, but based on what I can read so far, the following is true:

Tesla Q3 '22 EPS - $1.05

Tesla Q3 '21 EPS - $.48

Tesla TTM eps $3.33. At the current SP of $208 (after hours), that puts PE ratio at 62. Down almost 20 points from it's current PE due to earnings growth. 

Meta - Between Q3 '21 and Q2 '22, EPS have declined by 23%, with an even bigger decline YOY once their Q3 earnings come out.

Amazon - Q3 '21 eps were $0.31 and Q2 '22 eps were negative (-0.20). Maybe they'll get some support from Rivian SP going up around 30% between beginning Q3 and end of Q3, but their operating margins are still lousy in this inflationary environment. They're up against a tough comparison for Q3 '21 so their TTM EPS will likely further decrease, pushing up their PE ratio and putting pressure on share price.

Google - EPS have decreased from $1.40 in Q3 '21 to $1.20 for Q2 '22. We'll have to see what Q3 brings, but likely it'll be less than the $1.4 eps they made in Q3 '21.

Even apple is seeing eps decline. 

My only point is that we've been in an earnings recession within big tech (and tech in general) for the past several quarters. Tesla has been one of the few outliers. Their eps growth has been explosive, where everyone else has been declining.

382,1666226064,y8j9wj,1,"I believe a lot of people after Netlfix had the massive beat and rip after hours yesterday that with spy up almost 1% after hours that we would see a pretty green day. However, as I suspected futures called it with that gravestone doji yesterday and SPY with the hard rejection at 375 that we would see a retracement. Now the question is where do we go from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

We still have our phantom print down at 357 that needs to be filled at some point and until something bigger or better than that shows up I have no reason to suspect that we don’t fill that this week or next. 

We did break that v bottom recovery line and now are forming a nice falling wedge that gives support down at the 340s for this/ next week. 

The biggest bullish case here is that SPY did hard bounce off its daily 8ema and hold that support well. We once again saw a massive fight happening at 368.7 today and we did end up barely closing below it. As I was saying above 368 and until 378 is broken I would be looking for downside to retest that 356 to 360 area. 360 remains my next target and with Tesla missing earnings we should see that happen tomorrow or the next day.

Taking a look at futures here we can see a break through of the V bottom support and as of now we are rejecting that daily 20ema level. Overall I am seeing continued evidence of downside. The one thing I do want to see in order to believe in a retest of that 3585 level is that we break through and close below 3680 support tomorrow. That was a key bounce area today and a key previous resistance level. 

Support- 3680 -&gt; 3586

Resistance- 3760 -&gt; 3805

Apple overall doesn’t look terrible, but we saw once again a rejection of that key 143.8 level today and we saw a retest and rejection of the daily 20ema which should lead to more downside. 

With Tesla missing on earnings due to a beat of expectations but revenue short fall (I wish I could listened to the call to see what he had to say) I do wonder with Apples report of Iphone 14 production cut and now this tesla earnings if we see that trickle down to the rest of tech who reports next week. 

Key support- 141.6 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 135

I had been saying pretty much all week that I expected tesla COULD beat earnings but give poor guidance which would result in a sell off and well that’s pretty much exactly what happened today. I was actually even more bearish on earnings today seeing yesterdays massive rejection followed by the daily 8ema rejection… its funny how the markets “know” when to not go too bullish ahead of time…

I will be watching key 205 support the most tomorrow and the rest of this week. If and when that support is broke/  closed below that is when I suspect tesla could start its descent to the 180s. 

Key support- 219.6 -&gt; 205.8

Key resistance- 223.6

The VIX once again gave us zero direction and zero guidance of what to expect. The biggest thing I am noting is that the fear in the markets is not unwinding. To me that means we are not quite read for the next wave up. 

I zoomed out a little bit so we could look back at the June bottom. If you see there is quite the difference between the two times. Once that June 16th 52 week low was in the VIX had already “peaked” and already was on its descent down. The touch of the VIX on June 16th had a huge wick and after that it was a straight sell off. 

The biggest difference is that on the current VIX trend is that we put a new low in on October 13th and about 1 or 2 days before that we “peaked” however we are not seeing the same level of sell off now that we did then. And the overall downward resistance line from that peak was broken today. 

The VIX is still holding that 20ema support and we are still in that danger zone of 28.4 to 33. I struggle to be truly bullish that the “bottom” is in and that we are going on a big rally until I see the vix break through that 28.4 support range. 

10% challenge-

Overall actually kind of a tough day to trade today. The biggest issue of the day was the IV and IV rank was so high from the previous day that the movements yesterday that were paying out an east 10-25% gains were barely paying 5% before it turned against you. It actually was very interesting to see how the premiums were moving today. 

A few times I noted in one specific Call play I was in that the price of SPY had fallen and fallen a decent amount where I definitely should have had my 20% stop loss hit, however, with the drop in SPY my call actually rose in value. Then once SPY did bounce my actual premium barely increased in value. It was almost like the actual movement of premiums was happening before the actual movement of SPY happened. I definitely caught a few plays where the technical setup of them looked perfect, however, caught a rogue bounce that stopped me out before I was able to capitalize. Overall a green day so no complaints but definitely a tough day to trade today.

First let's do Tesla.

**Tesla needed to be perfect, it wasn't:**

* Missed on deliveries, logistics problems, revenue miss, EPS miss.
* Let's not forget this stock has a 80PE and a valuation based on never ending growth, 0% interest rates, and meme stock buying. Rates are at 5%, consumers ran out of disposable income/savings, Tesla lost the ""wow"" factor, all other competitors are in the space now.
* I told you to sell calls: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla\_time\_to\_sell\_calls/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla_time_to_sell_calls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

If you bought calls, enough the down move, but look to be adding puts at the 200 price level. I recommend selling the -190/+180 put spread to balance out the sold calls. If you are bullish in Tesla (why tho?) then just sell those puts because IV is going to be crazy in the AM if we gap down hard as expected .

**Which Week is Best to Trade on Tesla?**

Here is a custom chart I made for you. Let's review the implied volatility in Tesla over the next 10 weeks. As you can hopefully see in this chart, IV for calls is higher than puts! It is all you dumbasses bidding up the calls. I highly encourage anyone holding calls to sell, and if you are not long calls, then start shorting them. **4 weeks out** has great liquidity, high volume, tight spreads. That is where you want to be.

**Which Strike is Best to Trade on Tesla?**

Here is another custom chart I made for you guys. The ""lighter"" colored lines represent Black Scholes and what the options ""should"" be priced at. The solid color lines are the real prices.

In looking at this chart you can see that, because of our collective stupidity, IV for calls is higher than puts (people are dumb and buying calls). Conclusion, sell calls!  
When we look at the strikes we can see there is a lot of volume and liquidity at the nice round numbers like 190,200,210, 220.

If you are selling options, sell those that are overpriced (OTM puts and ITM calls) and buy those that are underpriced (ITM puts and OTM calls)

Tesla is starting the long road down

**And now to the overall market.**

Tesla earnings just killed all hopes of a sustained rally. Our lord and savior Elon has forsaken the market with the elevated valuation that now has to come back to earth.

* 2 year rates new high:
* Dollar nearing highs:

394,1666210407,y8czyj,1,"Tesla reported third-quarter earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

* **Earnings: $1.05 vs 99 cents per share (adjusted) expected**
* **Revenue: $21.45 billion vs $21.96 billion expected**

Shares fell by around 6% on the news of revenue falling just short of expectations.

The company previously reported that its deliveries for the quarter ending September 30 reached 343,000 and vehicle production reached 365,000. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla. Shares have dipped more than 17% since that weekend report on October 2.

During the quarter, Tesla faced soaring commodity and energy prices, problems shipping cars to customers, and executive turnover including the notable departure of AI leader Andrej Karpathy in July.

However, the company also notched a record in China after suspending most production temporarily in July to make factory upgrades there. According to the China Passenger Car Association, Tesla delivered 83,135 electric vehicles made at its Shanghai factory during the month of September, the most in a single month since the plant opened in late 2019.

Tesla is now working to reach full capacity production levels at two new factories in Germany and Texas, and to make good on a long-delayed promise to make Tesla cars self-driving with no new hardware, only software updates. Musk has promised Tesla will begin deliveries of the company’s heavy-duty all electric truck, the Semi, in December this year.

Tesla picks questions for executives to answer ahead of earnings calls using an online platform, Say Technologies. Questions submitted there before Wednesday concerned the possibility of share buybacks, and Tesla’s progress towards mass manufacturing its own battery cells, and its unconventional pickup, the Cybertruck, first unveiled in 2019.

Retail and institutional investors are also interested in whether demand for Tesla vehicles will remain high, grow or retract in an inflationary environment and specifically in China, which was the world’s largest market for electric vehicles in the first half of 2022.

Citi analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday ahead of Tesla earnings that they think shareholders will focus on Tesla’s fourth-quarter outlook for deliveries and gross margins, but also noted “We are not sure the Q3 update alone can fully address macro concerns into Q4 and 2023, so the stock might quickly revert to trading on macro/industry datapoints.”

Musk is in the midst of a $44 billion acquisition of the social networking giant Twitter — a crucial platform for promoting Tesla, SpaceX and its internet service Starlink — after fighting in court to get out of the deal which he initially proposed and agreed to in April 2022.

Musk, who is also the CEO of SpaceX, has embroiled himself in geopolitical controversy by sounding off about China and Taiwan, nuclear war, Russia and Ukraine in recent weeks. He also shared tweets that seemed to endorse Ye, the hip hop and fashion icon formerly known as Kanye West. Ye has agreed to buy Parler, a right-wing social media app, after other social networks suspended him over antisemitic posts. In one of the tweets, which Musk has since deleted, he shared a Dragon Ball meme appearing to promote a future collaboration with a potentially Ye-owned Parler and Musk-owned Twitter.

Tesla fans have asked, but Musk has not yet said, whether he will sell more Tesla shares to finance the Twitter deal.

Well we have officially filled the October 7th phantom range of 373.29. Now the question is do we fill the phantom range of 357.28 from yesterday? 

Currently we are through most of the bear channels on spy and tech, however we are NOT through SPYs august peak resistance line. We still need to see closer to 380 to test that. The biggest thing I am seeing right now is that SPY is holding 356.5 to 378.3 range for the last 19 trading days. We are in consolidation mode. The closer we get to 378.3 the more we should be eyeing a retest of 356. However, if we can truly breakout over 378.3 and retake 380 (50% retracement of bear channel) we can start thinking about a more significant dead cat bounce like July. 

368.7 is currently holding as a major support line. If and when that is broken that should signal more downside. Current daily candle is closing as a hanging man candle. I do like downside for tomorrow (look at October 4th for comparison).

Key support- 371 -&gt; 368.6 -&gt; 364 -&gt; 357

Futures was able to break out yesterday over that key 3680 resistance line however todays candle closing as a huge bodied gravestone doji after this run up is bearish omen for tomorrow and rest of the week. Will be keeping a close eye on how this closes out tomorrow for a hint of the rest of the week. 

Futures is inside the same channel that SPY is form 3590 to 3805. With key support at 3680. 

Key support- 3680 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3747 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3882

Apple is a hard one to get a good read on today. On one hand we had a nice breakout over that black resistance line. Which effectively means Apple broke its 2 month long bear channel today. On the other hand with that iphone news apple went on a massive sell off and closed back under the daily 20ema after wicking through the daily 8ema. The v bottom recovery support is broken now also. Apple could go either way but with this iphone sales issue I do wonder if we see a sell off on tech tomorrow for tesla earnings and Apple earnings next week. We could be seeing a bigger miss set up and bad guidance on Apple. 

Apple also failed to breakout of its key 146.5 resistance today. Which means its still trading in that 146.5 to 138.2 channel. Favor to downside based off that rejection. If Apple retakes 149.3 at any time that would change my bias to bullish on them. 

Key support- 143.7 -&gt; 142.4 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 146.5 -&gt; 147.6 -&gt; 149.3

Similar movement on Tesla. It broke that month long bear channel finally, however, put in a pretty red candle today after rejecting 230. Interestingly enough it didn’t even have the strength to retest the true resistance at 233. I am bearish on tesla personally and even with a potential earnings beat I do have a feeling guidance will not be received well and that could lead to quite the sell off. 

Tesla v bottom is still in tact though so we will look at that key 220 support level tomorrow. 

Key support- 220 -&gt; 215 -&gt; 205

Key resistance- 224.3 -&gt; 233.6

The VIX continues to show that this current two day rally doesn’t really have full market support behind it. In order to be in belief that markets truly are going to see a bigger rally this week and next I would like to see the VIX minimally under 30 but more realistically under 28.3. however, the bull channel that takes back to August bottom has been officially broken. We do have one more support to keep an eye on though. If and when that level is taken out (Red line) then I will be more bullish biased. 

This VIX candle is setting up pretty similarly to the October 5th candle also. I do still personally believe a VIX bounce is coming and that SPY will leg back down to the 350s. 

I am keeping in mind that FOMC is on November 2nd and with this media craze of fed pivot in December (which im 100% sure JPOW will remind us is NOT going to happen…) I could see a case where we are bullish/ range bounce until FOMC. FOMC besides earnings next week (when most big companies present) there really isn’t anything major news wise to push markets one way or another right now. 

10% challenge-

Unfortunately had to miss the opening 45 minutes cause of the dentist today but was able to have a pretty nice day. Took a few Ls on some bad bounces today and closes some plays to only watch my potential profits double if not triple… but overall a great day. 

Even though it sucks to watch my 20% win go to 60% a few minutes later and sucks even more watching my -20% stop loss hit only for in 5 minutes that play to go back green… I have found that I HAVE to be mechanical in this market. Too many times in the past I have said no that’s a bad bounce let me hold. It will come back for sure… only to watch my $2k position which at 20% stop loss is about $400 turn into a -$2000 loss because I thought I was smarter then the charts and smarter than SPY. 

A $400 loss (-20% stop loss) is only two 10% wins to recover. That’s pretty easy to accomplish in this market especially when im paying 8-10 plays/ day lately and averaging a 80%+ win rate. 

However, a -$2000 loss is ten 10% wins (assuming I can manage ten perfect wins in a row). Now that takes a little bit more effort to accomplish. And not only that it takes me 10 wins to get back to break even vs. the other that takes me 2 wins.. that means in the same 10 wins I could have made $1600 profits if I just used a stop loss. 

Stop losses are so important and are overlooked by so many people. Profits are great and so is a high win rate… but if your losses over come all those wins and profits it doesn’t even matter…

She calls it one of the most innovative companies in the world, besides saying that there's no stopping electric vehicles for now.

So, Cathie Wood said traditional automakers could be in trouble in a battle with Tesla, considering oil demand in the summer was lower than usual, leading to greater demand for electric vehicles.

The CEO of ARK Invest is very confident in Tesla and believes that the automaker is in the ""driver's seat"" of the EV revolution. And that the traditional automotive industry needs to move to the next phase of growth like Tesla, which is autonomous vehicles.

We also just EOD had another phantom range hit the books. I have never ever seen this many phantom ranges hit the books like this before. I really don’t know how to take these. At first it was a guaranteed hit but now we are seeing that not really the case. We still have the untouched/ fill phantom print from October 7th at 373.29. Now we currently have todays phantom bottom at 357.28. Its odd to say the least.

Spy currently is trading within that grey sideways channel which is 356.5 to 378.2 with the main price action happening between 356.5 and 368.7. I believe which ever one of these breaks first will be the way we push. Todays price action actually looked extremely similar to October 3rd and 4th. 

What we saw today was VOLD green pretty much 98% of the day (a handful of red candles) and in extreme bull momentum all day but SPY didn’t push up with it. Spy held the same about $2 range from 1145am till EOD.

We have two different downward channels a red one and a black one. We also are forming a falling wedge with the red bear channel support and black bear channel resistance. 

Overall im bearish under 368.6 with VIX over 31. If those conditions change tomorrow I may start looking for some upside. We are hitting earnings right now with a few decent names this week but most next week. That will be interesting to see how those play out in the market. 

Key support- 364 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.4

Futes is in an overall downward channel that’s black and blue. Currently that black and blue channels also form a falling wedge which we are holding beneath and it also lines up with the key daily 20ema resistance line. 

The biggest bullish thing for today depending on where futes close is that they are holding over and will close over 3680 resistance. Key resistance is that black resistance at 3695 for tomorrow.

Apple has a nice blue falling wedge forming and actually is holding its sideways channel of 138 to 142.4. I will be looking at the falling wedge and key levels of that channel before I decide which way markets going to go. For a lot of today it seemed like once again Apple looked weak while the general markets were propping everything up. 

Looking at the last 3 days of price action on Apple it actually does appear to be forming a daily bear flag. 

Key support- 138 -&gt; 134.9

Key resistance- 142.5 (blue falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 144.3 -&gt; 146 (black bear channel)

Tesla is one that I struggle with. So looking at its chart Friday we had a massive full on bearishly engulfing candle. That SHOULD have led to further downside on Tesla today. However, it put in a pretty massive green inside day. The thoughts would be this was a relief bounce that did reject the daily 8ema and still is holding under black bear channel resistance. With earnings this week we could see Tesla move outside of the technical. 

Key support- 215 -&gt; 205 -&gt; 196.1

Key resistance- 220 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 224.4 -&gt; 233.7

Despite all these media narrative or fed pausing and bullish rally to SPX 4000… until the VIX breaks through this bull channel its in which is bounced off support of today I will not be playing calls. Will be watching the VIX closely this week for a break down in order to flip long. 

Key level tomorrow is 31.1. we are still trading in the orange 28.4 to 33 channel which also is a bigger indication of where we could be headed next.

430,1665979067,y60sqv,1,"Let me preface this all with a little bit of background… 
There once was a special child named Elon Tusk and this special crayon eating minion dreamed of going to space 🚀 and having alien babies. As he grew older, he realized that the big fancy rockets weren’t cheap so he decided to get absolutely MINTED 🤑. He did this by processing payments via the inter webs. One day, I big fancy company bought his little shop for like a gajillion doll hairs and he bought an expensive car that looked like a spaceship, but didn’t realize it wasn’t one until he saw it in person 🙃

Still with me? 

Great, so our fren, Elon Tusk was having a midlife crises and liked his spaceship car so much, he decided to make his own. He realized that the closes spaceship car he could build was an electric car, because of the sound. He scaled this cool sounding spaceship car into a very large public company with the help of the United States government and fanboys like myself. Then, one day he look out at the sky while cruising the PCH and noticed, his spaceship couldn’t fly. This angered our fren, Elon Tusk because he was yet again, tethered to the ground. 

Enter SpaceseX, we all know this story. Couple rockets go boom, and a couple flew. Elon even sent his spaceship car into space in hopes that maybe, just maybe an alien would slingshot that shit back to him as a sign of peace (and foreplay). 

Elon Tusk was sitting on his launchpad one day and a little birdie landed right on the top of his nose and said “buy twitter, you fucking spaz”


That brings us to today,

Elon has so much money (like a FUCK TON), BUTT not nearly enough to buy twitter in CASH MONIES, unless… investors and banks lend him some CASH MONIES, they all make an agreement that he will buy twitter for like a gajillion dollhairs… 

Problem is, Elon really likes rockets and aliens, so he entirely forgot that he agreed to by a little birdie company… the birdie company all gets hot and bothered because they had this opportunity to get ABSOLUTELY MINTED and Elon Tusk just forgot about them :(

So, they go to court, all the dirty panties get aired out on the same birdie company website that Elon Tusk is contractually obligated to buy… then, one day, the birdie and the absolute fox of a judge decide to give papa Elon Tusk another shot… 

Buddy has a shitload of money committed and signed for to fund the deal, problem is that nobody wants to lend money to anybody (even billionaires) unless they got sum skin in the game. 

Now, why doesn’t he just sell all his Tesla stock and buy twitter outright? 
Well, it was kinda a joke to start out and then he basically got high as giraffe pussy one day and was like “fuck it”… or something like that (I assume). But now… he is contractually a obligated to. And if he were to sell all his stock, he would effectively tank his money tree and not be able to build rockets and have baby aliens :(

So… he settled on some loans and I believe some partners to buy twitter, problem is he still needs to sell a couple billi in space car stock in order for the deal to go through. 

🚨 So, here’s where the actual DD cums into play.

FACTS TO CONSIDER 🧠 
👉His blackout period ends the 18th of October (he will most likely be liquidating some fat stacks worth of stock)
👉He contractually has to buy twitter by the 28th or he gets fukked by the system (and a little birdie)
👉Many investors have been trying to get papa Elon to buyback stock in order to boost the share price and protect the company against short sellers
👉Earnings are on the 19th 


All these yellow fingers considered, leads us to a reasonably logical outcome.

Tesla buys back shares at a discounted price (because everybody is expecting him to sell his shares) effectively inflating Tesla shares (also, allowing him to sell less shares and still get his Billi’s to buy the birdie). Papa Elon buys the birdie and we all live happily for the day.

So…What’s the play? 

💨POOTS on Tesla… yep, puts going into earnings. 
🤑SELL poots  before earnings 
💵 CALLS before earnings (12dte)
🤑SELL calls when he announces buybacks 
💨POOTS (longer dated ) when he announces buybacks (cheaper)
🤑SELL poots  when he starts selling


Teslas earnings are expected to miss so the voodo forces at play might actually rocket Tesla  to the moon if there is any announcement this week ( buybacks)

1- Electric option 
2- Clean energy source for alternative solutions 
To be perfectly unbiased NKLA maybe facing temporary challenges vs TSLA’s broader followers base due to Elon’s major presence and influence on Twitter because twitter is like the world town hall, which he can attract more attention to Tesla products. So do never underestimate his power, in the other side of the fence NKLA’s truck products are just in its infancy phase. I personally respect their resilience with competing with a giant like Tesla. It’s like having a 17 year kid fighting a well seasoned knight without horse, spear and protection. I love NKLA products for 2 additional environmental reasons:
1- More clean fuel source options and range 
2- Potentially contributing in environmental protection 

I love Tesla’s products too but as someone with wealth growth mindset with as little money as possible I don’t like TSLA stock as it’s highly expensive and mature (Tesla stock), I personally content to have built 7000 shares in NKLA in my portfolio as I believe the today’s $3-$10 range per NKLA stock is a great wealth building opportunity for me. However, I also understand that to reach my financial goals of wealth building this requires me to hold it for longer period of time, be strategically patient with it and just go with NKLA’s flow to travel it’s natural growth path. 

There is a famous saying:
Room wasn’t built in a day. Tesla didn’t reach to what it’s today either. I remember when Elon was talking about Tesla potential people were mocking him and his product but people that believed in him stayed the course till today. I also believe that it takes time, patience of a monk to watch NKLA gradually reach to $5,  $10, $20, $25, $40, and beyond.

I am not suggesting this to anyone here, I understand the risk of holding this, I am 💯 committed to my core beliefs of NKLA values, therefore I am done building my 7,000 shares of NKLA. I just let it do it’s thing.

Astrology is the ancient knowledge of cosmic truth and its impact on the order of human and natural affairs, through duly repeated observation of astrological cycles and their relationship with a condensed mystical narrative according to how the stars are grouped together.

This is likely to sound stupid to the suits on Wall Street. However, with proper study they could easily be the greatest beneficiaries of this knowledge. Can the stars meddle in business affairs? Yes, they can. And they have, throughout history.

For example, if we take a look at Forbes’ top companies on the stock market, we find that the gold medal for business founders among the Top 500 corresponds to Aries, the sign linked to beginnings (Visa, Wal-Mart, JP Morgan, Google, among others).

As far as personalities go, Elon Musk was born under the sign of Cancer, as was Nikola Tesla. The Red Bull brand was created by a Taurus (the bull). Astrological signs are traditionally grouped according to the elements, and curiously, Coca-Cola was created by a man born under the element of water (same as Budweiser); Boeing, lord of the skies, was born under an air sign, as was Vanderbilt (transportation and trade magnate, areas associated with air element); Andrew Carnegie, steel foundry magnate, under the sign of fire, and C. L. Best (Caterpillar Tractor Company) under a sign of earth.

And if, as the saying goes, “astrology is the religion of women,” those born between cardinal signs seem to triumph with greater frequency among female. The seven richest women in the world, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, Alice Walton, MacKenzie Scott, Julia Koch, Miriam Adelson, Jacqueline Mars, and Yang Huiyan, were born under these signs: Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. Seven of the eight most powerful women as of 2020 according to Forbes were also born under these cardinal signs: Merkel, Lagarde, Harris, von der Leyen, Barra, Pelosi.

But the stars not only imbue our births with a cosmic baptism of energy and determine a large part of our destinies, even more importantly, they affect daily actions and behaviors for individuals as well as companies and markets.

It happens that Wall Street, for example, usually drops in October. There is a very high over-representation of Wall Street drops occurring in Libra or Scorpio, for which there is no “rational” explanation. There is, however, an astrological explanation: in October is when the fall begins (Libra/auntum) begins and the destruction of Scorpio (the poisonous scorpion) is consummated. We can observe as well that on numerous occasions stocks rise with the new moon and fall with the full moon (a phenomenon studied in depth by Ilia Dichev and Troy Janes, University of Michigan).

But while the biggest crashes occur during autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, this season also witnesses the greatest upward rallies. According to statistics from Bloomberg, in the last ten years five out of ten best days in the year for investing occurred in autumn, under Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius). The other five days were split between Aries (3) and Pisces (2), with a striking absence of the more stable earth signs.

How can the same astrological momentum create the best and worst financial results? Astrology is not a linear science, certainly not an exact science, but it nevertheless offers truth. The answer to this question lies within dialectics and the “attraction of opposites.”

The Zodiac sign most related to money, Taurus, is also behind the greatest proponents of Communism around the world, such as Lenin, Marx, and Guevara. “Together, we form a necessary paradox; not a senseless contradiction.” (C. Jami)

This understanding can also be applied to other speculative areas, such as cryptocurrency (usually trending upward in the new moon and falling under the full moon), commodities, foreign exchange, and even sports betting. Yes, sport betting: Seven out of eight Grand Slam titles in men’s and women’s tennis this last season were won by Geminis (Nadal, Djokovic, Rybakina, and Swiatek, for example).

Each and every area of speculative investment can benefit immensely from the correct use of astrological science, applying it from a scientific, practical, and statistical methodology. In summary, a kind of Big Data Astrology, where huge statistical samples serve to understand astro-human relationships.

There are already many established patterns and investors that would benefit; the challenge is to implement a more developed system combining a large sampling of stock market variations and using algorithms to analyze the irregularities based on astrological premises, thus creating astrological guidelines accurate enough to predict future stock market movements.

The key is combining the present (Big Data) and the past (astrological wisdom), keeping in mind that the origins of computer science are closely linked to astronomy, making computers incredibly powerful in this regard and incomparably superior to our ancestors’ methods of calculation.

If you compare a given company’s stock price over thousands of days with the position of one specific planet or the moon, you would likely find a patter to the relationship between the moon’s position in the heavens and the company’s stock. The more marked the patter, the greater the likelihood of its recurrence.

I’d like to point out that these conclusions must be taken with the awareness that no matter how accurate, it is not an exact science, and no matter how much Big Data is used mankind’s free will eludes any galactic interference. This article presents a mere hypothesis, and hopes to open the door to the development of what could be a type of modern alchemy, easy to achieve with the proper budget and resources, combining aspects of astrology and Big Data to create software capable of predicting not only movements in the stock market, but also in any type of speculative assets.

From abstract bases it will be possible through Big Data to reach perfectly quantifiable conclusions and patterns that would allow investors to shed light on markets’ futures. We will be achieving with computers and equations what our ancestors did thousands of years ago: searching the heavens for clues about the future and chasing its brightness through the darkness of the night.",Wall Street Astrology (Article),1.0,2022-10-15 01:25:27

But companies like Google and Tesla do provide value to their investors because they provide value to their customers: they actually do something useful, unlike, say, Bernie Madoff. Likewise, Warren Buffett provides value to his customers by investing in companies which provide great value to their customers. So The Ponzi Factor's claim just don't make sense.

# Trevor Milton was accused of boasting about nonexistent technology to inflate the stock price of Nikola, a maker of electric trucks.

A federal jury on Friday found Trevor Milton guilty of defrauding investors by lying about the supposed technical achievements of Nikola, the electric truck maker he founded.

Mr. Milton was convicted of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud, the most serious of which carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. He was acquitted on an additional count of securities fraud. The jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan delivered the verdict after about four weeks of testimony and about six hours of deliberation.

Prosecutors portrayed Mr. Milton, 40, as a serial fabricator who wooed investors by falsely claiming that Nikola was close to producing long-haul trucks that could run emission-free on cheap hydrogen.

“Trevor Milton is a con man,” Jordan Estes, assistant U.S. attorney, said Thursday as she summarized the government’s case. “He lied to investors to get their money, plain and simple.”

Defense attorneys argued that Mr. Milton did not intend to defraud anybody and that his statements were not responsible for a plunge in Nikola's stock price that wiped out billions of dollars in value.

Marc Mukasey, a defense lawyer, acknowledged that Mr. Milton sometimes spoke in the present tense about things Nikola hoped to achieve in the future. “He loved Nikola,” Mr. Mukasey told jurors on Thursday, likening Mr. Milton to an overenthusiastic parent who brags about his child.

On Friday, Mr. Mukasey said, “We respect the verdict, but we’re going to keep fighting.”

Mr. Milton, who had appeared cheerful during much of the trial, shook his head in apparent disbelief after hearing the verdict. His wife, Chelsey Milton, leaned her head against the back of a courtroom bench and sobbed.

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, who presided over the trial, allowed Mr. Milton to remain free on a $100 million bond until sentencing in January.

The case provided a lesson in the hazards of investing in fledgling “pre-revenue” electric vehicle makers that have ideas but limited or nonexistent sales. With the exception of Tesla, new carmakers have struggled with manufacturing problems.

In a recent example, [Rivian](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/rivian-recall-steering.html), a maker of electric pickup trucks, said last week that it was recalling almost all of the vehicles it has produced because a small number have an improperly tightened fastener that could cause the steering to malfunction.

The Milton trial was also a was a test of prosecutors’ ability to hold managers of publicly traded companies accountable for statements they make on social media and other public forums that can cause share prices to gyrate. Mr. Milton was a prolific user of Twitter and frequently appeared on podcasts and business news programs.

A college dropout with no formal training in engineering, Mr. Milton founded Nikola in 2015 in the basement of his Salt Lake City home. The company listed on Nasdaq in 2020 by merging with a special purpose acquisition corporation, or SPAC, called VectoIQ Acquisition Corporation. VectoIQ is managed by Stephen Girsky, a former high-ranking executive at General Motors. The deal with the so-called blank-check corporation allowed Nikola to avoid some of the regulatory scrutiny usually applied to initial public offerings.

After the stock market listing made him wealthy, Mr. Milton, who [owned 25 percent of Nikola shares](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/business/nikola-trevor-milton-fraud.html), went on a spending spree, buying luxuries including a Gulfstream jet and a multimillion-dollar home in the Turks and Caicos Islands. In about six months during 2020, according to testimony, Mr. Milton spent more than $80 million.

Nikola shares peaked near $80 in June 2020, when the company was worth more than Ford Motor. Shortly after, the investment firm Hindenburg Research issued a [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/) accusing Mr. Milton of making numerous false assertions about the company's technology, pointing to a video in which a truck was rolled down an incline to make it look like a working prototype.

Mr. Mukasey dismissed the video as mere “special effects.”

“It’s certainly not a crime to use special effects,” Mr. Mukasey told jurors. “Otherwise the government would have to indict the Energizer Bunny.”

Mr. Milton [resigned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/business/nikola-trevor-milton-resigns.html) as executive chairman a few weeks after the Hindenburg report. Nikola shares closed Friday at $3.06.

Last year, Nikola agreed to pay a [civil penalty of $125 million ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/business/nikola-sec-fraud-investigation.html?searchResultPosition=2)to settle a fraud investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

Nikola aspired to be the Tesla of the trucking industry — both companies took their name from Nikola Tesla, a pioneer in developing alternating-current technology. Nikola planned to build trucks that would be powered by emission-free hydrogen fuel cells. The company would build a network of hydrogen fueling stations along major highways, much as Tesla built a network of charging stations.

During the trial, prosecutors played video interviews in which Mr. Milton claimed Nikola was already producing “green” hydrogen with renewable energy for less than the cost of diesel, a major milestone. “Game is over for diesel,” Mr. Milton said on Twitter.

In fact, Nikola had produced “not one molecule” of hydrogen, Ms. Estes said. Others in the fledgling green hydrogen industry are still struggling to produce the gas cheaply enough to undercut diesel.

Mr. Milton also said he had billions of dollars in binding contracts with trucking companies to buy Nikola vehicles. The “contracts” were just reservations that could easily be canceled, prosecutors contended.

Among the witnesses was Scott Damman, a senior manager at General Motors, which planned to build a battery-powered pickup truck, the Badger, with Nikola. The announcement of the Badger in February 2020 caused a spike in Nikola's stock price.

Mr. Damman testified that G.M. would have manufactured the truck and supplied all of the engineering and technology, while Nikola contributed some of the design and marketing.

Nonetheless, according to testimony, Mr. Milton said on Twitter and other forums that Nikola was responsible for “100 percent” of the technology in the Badger, portraying G.M. as little more than a supporting player. G.M. pulled out of the partnership soon after the Hindenburg report, and the Badger was never produced.

Other Nikola executives including Mark Russell, the chief executive, and Kim Brady, the chief financial officer, warned Mr. Milton repeatedly that his statements could backfire, prosecutors contended. The executives even staged an “intervention” where they tried, unsuccessfully, to get Mr. Milton to hew to the truth, according to witnesses.

Mr. Mukasey, the defense lawyer, pointed to internal Nikola emails in which the executives praised Mr. Milton’s media appearances. “They were telling Trevor what a good job he was doing,” Mr. Mukasey said.

The convictions include a charge that Mr. Milton defrauded a man who sold him a ranch in Utah. Mr. Milton paid for the ranch in part with Nikola stock options that proved to be worthless.

The acquittal on one of the securities fraud counts offered Mr. Milton a bit of relief. A conviction on that charge would have exposed him to a maximum sentence of 25 years.

Nikola, based in Phoenix, continues to operate, producing a limited number of battery-powered trucks in cooperation with established companies including IVECO, an Italian truck maker that is manufacturing Nikola vehicles in Germany. Michael Lohscheller, an auto industry veteran who was previously the chief executive of the German carmaker Opel, was named president of Nikola in August. 

Stefan Hartung, chief executive of the German electronics maker Bosch, said in an interview this month that he still believed in Nikola. Bosch, one of the world's largest makers of components for the vehicle industry, is supplying fuel cell technology for Nikola trucks being developed.

“We are now pretty far in terms of industrialization capability,” Mr. Hartung said. “This vehicle can be built.”","Founder of Nikola Is Convicted of Fraud. Ladies and Gentleman, we got him",1.0,2022-10-14 21:54:40

I had mentioned two important things last week that I wanted to watch. The red sideways channel from 362.8 to 378.2 and the red diamond support line at 362.8 Well we officially broke through both of those and now have a full candle closed below the daily 8ema. I think its fairly safe to say that markets are starting to realize once again the fed is not going to pivot and CPI is about to be a huge miss. 

361 looked like up until the last minute or so that it was going to hold. However with a failure to break a new LOY and that pretty impressive rally out of the 357s I am seeing some upside potential for tomorrow at least. With a hanging man candle closure on the daily we should look for a reversal up. I am looking for 362.8 resistance to be retested tomorrow. If bulls can retake that we should be looking for 366.7 to 370.7 as a closure. 

Historically FOMC minutes opens red and closes relatively fall (Wednesday) so from there we should see a fairly flat week going into CPI somewhere around that 366 to 373 range. 

Key support- 357.1 -&gt; 352.4

Key resistance- 361 -&gt; 362.8 -&gt; 366.7 -&gt; 370.5

Futures showing the same breakdown as SPY today. Overall that doji candle closure after bouncing off key 3600 support should provide some upside relief tomorrow and possibly Wednesday before CPI.

Apple held its red sideways channel today and actually managed to close out a green day. With the same doji formed on apple along with holding key 140 support I expect a push for the gap fill of 147.54 before CPI on Thursday. 

If we lose 138.2 at any point I would be pretty comfortable in some puts for a bigger breakdown and a test of Apples 52week low. 

Today for most of the day Apple looked very strong but was constantly being held down by SPY. 

Key support- 140 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 141.3 -&gt; 142.5-&gt; 144

Despite Tesla closing its 4th red day in a row, and 7th out of the last 8 trading days red… I actually see a lot of strength in Tesla. I am seeing a nice 223 double bottom form on both the daily and weekly charts. Tesla with the doji I will be looking for that 8 day long red resistance line to be broken finally. That resistance lies at 221.3 tomorrow. Failure to break through that resistance would lead to downside and a bigger support test near 212.9.

I am bullish for tomorrow based on Apple and Tesla. I think we see a small relief bounce before CPI prints on Thursday. Key resistance of a break of the red channel lies at 240 on Wednesday. 

I also believe IF CPI does print badly that Tesla puts are going to be a great play. I believe looking at the weekly that tesla could see as low as 178 before next weeks earnings hit and likely boosts it back up. Of course a miss on tesla earnings and its gonna be really scary.

The VIX is very interesting to watch right now. Seemingly there was no major news that should have caused the vix to reach 34 today. However, once it did reach 34 we saw a pretty massive unwind of it there which saved SPY from a new 52week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious if we are going to see the VIX sitting closer to 33 to 34 this time. The one thing that helps the VIX is that the FOMC minutes release the day before CPI and that should cause a nice unwinding of the VIX historically. 

However, I am seeing the “capitulation” setup happening before our eyes… As long as the VIX holds near 32-35 before market closes on Wednesday AND cpi is a huge miss we should see the VIX break 40+ on Thursday. 

Septembers CPI saw the VIX spike 15%... usually we see a 15-20% spike on the VIX, however, it often unwinds by EOD… if we want to see the VIX break 40 we need to be at atleast 33-35 at market close on Wednesday night. 

Why is the VIX over 40 important? Well once we see that that is usually the sign of capitulation. Most people say VIX 40-60 is true capitulation signs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I wont be here EOW to post any TA on this I wanted to add my weekly chart and what I am looking at. I am looking at SPY to most likely hold somewhere from 360-370 by Wednesday at market close. Assuming that CPI is a miss (which if you read my CPI post you see I am expecting this) and we are going to see VIX 40+ by EOW and I believe SPY could see 338 EOW. That’s about a 9% drop from 370… If we get a CPI miss and don’t see 338 this week I believe we bounce near 328 to 335 the following week. 

10% challenge- 

Today was a pretty great day… most of the gains came form the opening hour. Again price action is horrible to trade and we are seeing positions go green and then immediately rip red. This still remains a scalpers paradise and remains a quick and frequent profit market. This is not the market to be greedy in.

The company, in a widely reported statement, said it had published an acceptable use policy, or AUP, in error, and that “PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and the language was never intended to be inserted into our policy.”

PayPal PYPL, -4.50%, which also owns the Venmo payment service, did not respond to a request for comment.

David Marcus, previously the president of PayPal, took to Twitter to criticize the company, to which prospective Twitter TWTR, -0.43% buyer and Tesla TSLA, -6.32% CEO Elon Musk simply said, “agreed.”

“BoycottPayPal” was a trending topic on Twitter over the weekend.

PayPal shares slumped over 4% on Friday and have dropped 52% this year. PayPal shares slipped 1% in early premarket trade.

The PayPal controversy is one of many which have riled up conservatives who feel they are unfairly targeted by big technology companies. GoFundMe, for instance, seized donations in support of Canadian truckers’ protest over COVID policy.

Privacy has been cited as a major concern as the Federal Reserve evaluates whether to create a central bank digital currency.

Lets start with the “why” SPY fell 2.79% Friday and then lets talk about it a little bit more. Last week well really Monday we saw a massive media pivot (punny haha) where all of a sudden they went from the doom and gloom to “most likely the fed will pause rate hikes after this November meeting.” It was kind of a really odd change of pace for the media as anyone with more then 2 brain cells pretty much understands that the fed is already way behind on these rate hikes and that the biggest mistake the fed could make right now is decreasing their rate hikes too fast or too soon. Que the Volker era mistakes. JPOW himself has been pretty clear that he is not going to stop rate hikes until 2024 most likely. 

So lets talk about Friday… we finally had a data drop that was “big” enough to effect the markets. We have been having jobless claims like usually and the last one actually showed a slight increase in jobless claims but unemployment decreased. Good for America right? Well no the FED is going to continue to be aggressive and increase rate hikes until inflation is down and pretty much till the economy takes a big hit. Without saying it the ideal unemployment rates near 8-10% for them. With a STRONG work force and STRONG economy Feds have a lot more room to be hawkish. 

This explains to me why we had a red open, however, it seems liked a bit of a over reaction in my opinion. But that brings me to my next “why” did Friday close so red. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfdraz49mls91.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2233d9273791bd6c640388732f5320169b03c3

Last Tuesday I mentioned the “phantom print” that hit the tapes. Now there is a lot of speculation about what these prints mean or why they are happening. Well we finally came down and touched 366.57 today. Only took 3 days this time, however, the last few times these prints have hit the day of or the next day the phantom print has been hit. 

Well lets fast forward to Friday and take a look at our range. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e5or73k9mls91.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cd3d3b933679a3233063dae2b2d1a18c30c8753

There it is… yet another phantom print hitting the tapes and effecting the daily range. Fridays TRUE high of day was 369.37 while the brokers are showing 373.29 as are true range. Why are these phantom prints such a big deal? Well from a logistical stand point it shows that the darkpool orders are really active behind the scenes right now. Someone is doing some massive buy and sells behind closed doors and are literally moving the markets with them. On the other hand from a technical stand point these phantom prints make the daily candles look completely different then what they are supposed to look like and effect patterns and algos and everything else. 

So where are we at not? Whats next for SPY? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c78dc79amls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8168bbafbf70e043eeee74b5d1c0da400846378b

I mentioned Thursday it looked like we were repeating the June tight consolidation before a major breakdown but now it appears we are repeating the June 21st to July 29th range trading of 372.5 to 390.2, however, this time our range is 362.8 to 378.3. As you can see even with the big dump today we bounced pretty aggressively off 360.94 and closed right at that key 362.79 support level. 

Now this is where the phantom print really messes with stuff… On one hand we have this massive $12.35 phantom candle when in reality its closed to a $8 candle range. With the phantom candle we have a wick over the daily 8ema, however, with the true candle we would have just closed a candle below the daily 8ema completely. The other thing is using the phantom candle we have the less aggressive black falling wedge with a resistance of 368.3 for Monday, however, the true candle uses that red dotted falling wedge which gives a resistance of 361.3 for Monday. They tell very different stories. 

The biggest story I am seeing and ill look to see how it plays out this week is that 362.8 to 378.3 range. Again as I said last week there are vey few reasons to go long here until after CPI on Thursday. Once that data drops good or bad we should have a pretty good sense of where we are headed for the next month. 

The more I look at SPY the more I see we actually are forming another massive diamond breakout pattern. Key diamond support for Monday is 361.9 and diamond resistance is 376.4. I will be watching this pattern closely next week for a hint of where we should see the next few weeks of trading take us. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ydqs0yamls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da653b35c9173b7b12a10f62d1f4c22efb94602

Taking a look at the weekly chart this is where I become more bearish then bullish. We after putting in one hell of a good fight to trade over the weekly 200ema for most of the week got wrecked on Friday and that led us to close back below the weekly 200ema. With this massively long wicked gravestone doji on a down trend I would expect further downside. Usually a gravestone doji on a down trend would lead to further downside instead of more upside. However, with a FOMC minutes Wednesday and CPI Thursday (look for the trade analysis of this in the server later today or tomorrow) we are going to see another week where the technical don’t matter. 

SPY is maintaining the highly aggressive black bear channel down and now also has an even more aggressive red dotted resistance line too. With a nice weekly 8ema breakout rejection. A lot of the signs of this weekly point to bearish. 

There is hints of a small V bottom forming as you can see but I am unsure if that plays out or not this week. The biggest thing I am seeing in the event of bad news from FOMC and CPI is that we could see a support bounce near 338 this week. This is the support form the covid crash. Spy would essentially be erasing 2 years of movement up if we retrace to that level. 

Key support- 362.1 (weekly v bottom) -&gt; 357 -&gt; 350.4 -&gt; 338 -&gt; 331.8

Key resistance- 366.6 -&gt; 369.1 (red dotted resistance) -&gt; 376.4 (black bear channel resistance) 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eo7vz8ibmls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=686c36bd842a3e333a9b396bd342b21247e466ea

Futures (I cleaned chart so you can see it better) has the same diamond pattern forming too. Key support for Monday is 3650 and key resistance is 3780. We are seeing the same similar pattern here on Futures where we are set in a bigger consolidation range of 3650 to 3805. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a8lranybmls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a3d6f58ee81db287b3869caa13384f177778b3d

Futures weekly looks similar but has a much bigger bodied gravestone doji. It almost looks like a hammer candle which could result in a reversal but with a small wick to the downside its classified as a doji. With that massive weekly 8ema rejection and red dotted resistance falling wedge inside the bear channel it does appear set up for further downside this week. 

Note we failed just barely to touch the jpm collar of 3870 and will look at the first set of puts at 3425 if we break down. 

Key support- 3590 -&gt; 3530 -&gt; 3470 -&gt; 3415 (black bear channel support) -&gt; 3395 (green bear channel support)

Key resistance- 3705 (red dotted resistance falling wedge) -&gt; 3855 (black bear channel) 

&amp;#x200B;

Highlighted in blue this time we once again have another diamond pattern formed on Apple. This times its quite a wide diamond pattern as opposed to the last one we saw back around the beginning to middle of September. Remember when that support broke on the diamond we saw the big downside push we have now play out. 

The only regret I have trading this week is not holding my apple puts. I was 100% correct in expecting that the 146.5 triple top with gravestone doji rejection of the blue bear channel resistance and closing back under the daily 8ema would lead to further downside. However, I closed my puts for breakeven because I knew I wouldn’t be trading yesterday (Friday) and would be able to manage the position. In the end no dollars lost so its find but I do wish I would have held those. 

Anyways that played out and now we are seeing the diamond pattern and this massive resistance line play out. Apple is set up for a decently green Monday unless bears come out swinging on Monday. Unless apple opens below 138.8 (-1%) and holds that all day we will see that black resistance line (through the diamond) broken to the upside which should lead to a much back to test 142.4 and possibly 144.1. Apple now has a gap to fill all the way up to 147.54 which I do expect to be in play early next week. 

Key support will be that blue diamond support at 140 and resistance at 145.9.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjpswxbdmls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21ac2335bd208f3e2ce4d732ad645d24de36f5f8

Apples weekly is actually one of the more bullish charts I have seen out here. Especially before Fridays massive dump Apple was putting in a really tight double bottom with a massive push up. However, the way this candle finished as a weekly 8ema rejection with a double bottom at 138.1 with a gravestone doji. Again very similar to a long bodied hammer candle which as a double bottom would lead to a huge push up, however, the gravestone doji becomes the wild card. 

Looking at the last month on Apple we are seeing quite the bit of dejavu honestly. Apple does look poised for an early week bounce. 

Key support- 138.2 -&gt; 133.4 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.7 -&gt; 145.5 (blue bear channel resistance) -&gt; 149.3

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla is the stock that just cant seem to catch a break. Every time it looks like it could bounce or could see a small push up it catches a bad break from the market. Earlier in the week when SPY and the rest of the market went on a massive run Tesla got stomped because of the delivery numbers and then it also got stomped because of the twitter deal. Now we are seeing the inverse head and shoulders pattern hopefully played out. I do believe that Tesla is due (way overdue) for a bounce but there is a chance it continues to drill a little lower before we find that support. 

Tesla is impressively red 6 of the last 7 days now and in the last 3 weeks has fallen a total of 29.3% in 3 weeks. Tesla is also now only 6.9% off of its 52 week low. My thoughts on tesla is that IF CPI comes in good tesla is finally going to put the boosters on and will be the best call position. However, if CPI is bad I think tesla will easily break into the 100s and will be a great short position. 

I am still looking for a small recovery bounce on Tesla early this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l3b768pemls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d7deb1a3f50385c778a44a28a2deea35d77809

Weekly timeframe wise we are seeing that the June recovery support line has finally been broken… remember this is the support line that many stocks (Spy and apple included) broke over a month ago. The toughest part of Tesla right here is that on one hand its down 30% in 3 weeks and it seems like FOMO chasing more puts on it… however, it clearly has not bounced and does not appear to want to bounce even when given every opportunity to bounce. 

The biggest bullish case I am seeing formed on Tesla right now is that it is forming a potential 222 double bottom off previous support. If Monday holds this 222 level there is a pretty good play on calls (especially if SPY and Apple start to bounce green). However, if we lose that 222 level I am looking for a bigger retrace to 207 and possibly all the way down to 178. The weekly 200ema which has not been touched since October 2019 sits at 186.3. 

Key support- 222 -&gt; 207 -&gt; 186.3

Key resistance- 238.9 (blue resistance) -&gt; 255

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vld75safmls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff4e9e2f8f630daf46ae97d9d5cfcad60fae65b9

Overall the VIX is still in a pretty clear upward channel right now. The vix remains stuck over 28.4 however is failing to break through and hold over 33. The one thing I am seeing is that this looked like a nice revert to mean move up on the VIX back to is previous 6 days trading period average of 31.6. 

With FOMC minutes and CPI next week I do wonder if they will attempt to artificially unwind the vix some next week. Having the VIX near 32 before FOMC minutes and CPI is a disaster waiting to happen and very well COULD result in the VIX breaking 40+ and full on capitulation that we all have been waiting for and the markets have “feared.”

Fed and Data wise this week we have one hell of a week ahead… 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w3uhmedgmls91.png?width=908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf4ab52102cd56fd13f8b90c27ffd4df8751b59

I will talk about this more detailed in my CPI write up and FOMC write up but I think we are setting up for a choppy to green early beginning of the week with a pretty massive break down Wednesday to Friday. 

I will be looking at for a pretty big CPI miss this time. CORE forecast is already set to be 0.2 to 0.1% higher then previous (with their consensus/ forecast being 0.2% +/-) so we really could be looking at anywhere from 6.3% (no change aka bearish) to 6.7% (big miss real bearish) and actual CPI while it has now come down 2 CPI in a row the consensus and forecast is HIGHER then the previous (with the same 0.2% +/-) we can expect a CPI of 7.8% to 8.3%. Note we have had as much as 0.3% of a difference in consensus and actual. So we could be seeing 7.7% to 8.4%.

If CPI comes in a 7.7-7.8% BUT core once again misses markets are gonna dump hard due to KNOWING fed can no pivot, however, if CPI comes in higher and CORE drops markets are likely to dump either way. The ONLY way I see markets rallying on Thursdays CPI numbers is if the CORE and CPI both drop… that would mean by some miracle the consensus of CPI and CORE CPI were incorrect. In my opinion odds of a big green CPI Thursday are low. 

10% challenge-

Overall this was an amazing week for me. I had a big benefit from playing some overnight swings (longer DTE) and picking the correction direction. I didn’t trade Friday due to family stuff but overall turned in an amazing week.

Rivian Automotive, Inc. is another EV manufacturer focused on pickups and SUVs. The company was founded in 2009 and is based in San Jose-California. 

Rivian is among the greenest of the EV makers choosing to achieve carbon neutrality well ahead of the Paris Climate Accord timeline. Rivian Automotive went public in 2021.
The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric adventure vehicles and accessories through direct sales to consumers and commercial markets. 

Lets dig deeper into the details of this company,
Like other EV companies, Rivian did not achieve profits.  Rivian launched its first car at the end of 2021 and said that it will start manufacturing at the end of this year.  The company's stock price is currently at 30 to 40 USD per share for two main reasons: it has secured $700 million in investments from Amazon and another $500 million investment from Ford and cooperation with Ford to develop EVs under the Ford brand (a great idea from the dinosaurs at Ford to buy a stake in the EV company and benefit from its expertise)  However, the partnership with Amazon is expected to be very fruitful because Amazon has stated that it will have 100,000 electric vans for delivery by the year 2040, and this has given this company a great value as any startup that combines the names of large companies with it in addition to the use of a great PR team can make the stock soar in the sky even if the company has negative cash flows, as the initial public offering of Revan is considered one of the greatest in the history of the US and during difficult conditions in the pandemic and a state of uncertainty, Add to that, recently Rivian signed a memorandum  An understanding with the German car maker, Mercedes-Benz, to cooperate in the field of electric vans. 

Rivian reported in a July 6 SEC filing that it produced 4,401 vehicles in the second quarter, an increase of 72% from the previous quarter.  4,467 vehicles delivered, an increase of 264% from the first quarter.  RIVN stock jumped 11% on the good news.

  In the first quarter of the year, Rivian produced 2,553 vehicles, including a mix of the Rivian R1T pickup truck, R1S SUV, and commercial trucks destined for its flagship customer Amazon.  1,227 vehicles were delivered in the first quarter.


  The company reiterated that it is on track to meet its production target of 25,000 EVs for 2022, but that's half its original estimate of 50,000, which indicates that the company is overburdening itself and if it fails to deliver on its promise could severely affect the company's stock.

  Production challenges that Rivian faced earlier this year forced the electric vehicle maker to review its promises and expectations, and Rivian says it does not expect it to be profitable for the foreseeable future.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from its initial public offering for working capital, growth financing and other general corporate purposes.

CEO Scaringe said at the Wolfe Research conference on February 24 that ramping up production at Rivian's Normal plant is ""definitely making progress,"" but supply chain issues are still slowing production.
Mr. Scaringi said the global shortage of semiconductor chips was the ""most painful"" obstacle to increasing production.

In my personal view, If Rivian can implement its plans and expand further, we are looking at the biggest competitor to Tesla in the future","Rivian Automotive, Inc. DD",1.0,2022-10-07 05:47:59

Well if you were looking for further clarification on where we could go next you are going to have to keep waiting. 

Today was yet again another range day except this one was even more dramatic and even more choppy. Had a pretty weak morning that quickly turned into untradeable chop that found extreme weakness end of day. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am seeing develop is a bull flag which could lead to upside potential, however, we are definitely going to need to see 378 broken and a clear move up over that daily 20ema. On the other hand I am seeing a soft rejection of the black bear channel, a rejection of the daily 20ema for the 3rd day in a row and a triple top at 378. We are pretty much stuck between 372.4 and 378 right now. With 370.6 being key support and clearly 378 being key resistance right now the risk to reward of playing anything right now especially with the looming CPI next Wednesday (4 trading days away) there is little risk to reward to swinging anything right now. 

Historically leading into CPI we saw a pretty hefty sell off, however, the last CPI we actually had a really impressive rally which was then immediately stopped out and led to a massive sell off after the big CPI Core miss. We most likely are going to see a lot of consolidation over the next 3 trading days as markets are unsure what to expect from CPI. 

On one hand any logical person knows that JPOW is not going to pivot or pause rate hikes in November like the markets appear to be “believing” right now, however, if we get a decrease in CPI and especially Core CPI next Wednesday that could be a big bullish push for markets. Remember even if its not rational markets can rally off it… just look at last julys rally, the BOE news rally, and this current rally based on another fake pivot move… however, on the other hand if we get a bad CPI and especially a bad core CPI we are going to see a pretty big move down and possibly put a new 52week low in as markets panic. 

Tomorrow going into next week is pretty simple. A close below 372.4 and especially under 370.6 supports I am bearish going into next week and would expect a 2 day selloff going into CPI like we have historically seen. However, a break of 378 resistance and we are going to be looking at a calls with another green push into CPI like last time. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z1dvj2ui0as91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f934815db2434f7fc8b47665c6377661708cc3d9

I removed some of my arrows to show the blue arrow pattern a little better but I mentioned this last week and its actually playing out even better now with the 372 to 378 chop. What ive we are actually recreating the march to may drop… may to June pop and consolidation before the huge June dump? 

The pattern is literally identical which would mean we start chopping here till next week. For June we saw the two days before CPI lead to the massive dump, however, its possible we just chop in this 370 to 378 range and then maybe we do get another bad CPI/ Core CPI and markets go into another week to two week sell off and we retest the 2022 bear market support. 320 would be the June 2020 resistance/ September 2020 support and 330 would be the November 2020 support and 337 would be the feb 2020 resistance.

My thoughts for the end of the week and especially Monday and Tuesday next week is that we are going to see quite a bit of chop. The markets could react negatively or positively to the unemployment data tomorrow morning but much like we saw this morning its unlikely to matter much. 

My thoughts remain that as long as SPY is holding between 370 and 380 we are in consolidation. This pattern has played out numerous times before the next move… August 31st to sept 8th, July 29th to August 9th, May 27th to June 8th, April 25th to May 5th, April 11th to April 21st, March 7th to March 15th, etc. etc. What is the other common denominator for these consolidation periods? They mostly are ended by an external event like CPI, FOMC, FOMC minutes, big fed days, etc. etc. It would make a lot of sense for the market to hold here before we head into the next big fed fuel move. If you think about it the markets do not want to be over extended one way or another before this meeting. And really even if markets are rallying on a false premise big money isn’t going to step in on hopes and dreams like retail will. 

The other key factor here is that the DMI Stochastic is hella overbought (just like last CPI). If we maintain these levels going into the next CPI with the stochs over bought like they were last time I wouldn’t be surprised to see the next leg down. 

I would actually like to hear peoples inputs about what they expect the next CPI to be and more specifically what they expect CORE CPI to be…

While I expect chop the thing that would completely negate this pattern is if we close a candle (daily candle body) under 370 or we close a candle (Daily candle body) over 380. That would in my opinion be our hint at the next move up. Or down. Historically speaking though we should see a move down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at futures you can see we have a nice falling wedge with that blue support line and the black resistance line. We are kinda out here in no mans land flirting with the 50% retracement line. Major resistance of the overall downward trend since August is up around 3950 and projected support is down closer to 3450. We are stuck in the middle. We are seeing that 3805 remains a level of stout resistance for futures both intraday and afterhours. I will be watching that closely and watching support at 3690 closely.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ml5segk0as91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee465357a4110aeaad34e9b626eb4cd1281110b

Apple I will say has one of the more clear in my opinion bearish setups. However, I am not convinced momentum or volume is going to let that play out. You can see the DMI stoch is hitting overbought territory finally here which does also play into not only an apple but an overall market downward move pending. 

What I am seeing on Apple is a soft blue bear channel resistance breakout test rejection along with a triple top at 146.5 with a gravestone doji. Sound really bearish? Well it is. But again with the CPI print next week we start to run into this is what it should do but markets are going to do what they want to do till that print is out. I actually had opened some Apple puts today 8dte to hold when I saw that 146.5 was rejecting and that the gravestone doji was forming. Well I actually initially bought calls and called that out on accident then was thankfully asked if that was what I meant to buy and sold then for a whole $1. I held the calls most of the day and oddly enough for them being 8dte and being ATM they got theta ate up bad. At the LOD (I bought then when Apple was around $146 and even at the LOD I was just barely able to sell them for breakeven. I ended up selling then before the 330pm pop at breakeven in the pickup line for my kiddos school).

I don’t know about you guys but I feel like Apple options are not paying out very well lately. I held some puts yesterday and ran into a similar situation where the reward for the move that happened didn’t seem to properly correlate. 

Anyways if I didn’t have to take the day off tomorrow the risk to reward to hold the Apple puts would have been there but I know I wont be able to manage the position and didn’t wanna hold a blind 0dte position. 

Much like SPY we are seeing a key consolidation zone being built of 142.5 support and 147.6 resistance. Further rejections of 147.6 resistance would lead me to a bearish mindset and further support bounces at 142.5 would make me believe in consolidation. If that blue resistance line is broken tomorrow (resistance at 146.9) then we just might see a bigger move up next week before CPI. Again we are approaching a fed even (CPI) where technical are going to play funny. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I had mentioned I was bullish on Tesla and I had expected us to see a bounce higher. Well I was half right. I was right enough for the option to play but I was not right enough for Tesla to close green. I wish I would have opened puts when I saw the sell off developing. Tesla has now put in 5 of the last 6 days red. Today ended up being an inside day for tesla (maintaining yesterdays range) and actually one of the lowest overall movements from low to high that tesla has seen in weeks. 

We did see an attempted retest of 245 breakout this morning that was rejected and we also once again lost 242.3 support and closed in the 230s for the first time since July 14th. This is where I am unsure of where Tesla is headed next. Technical wise I really do think that Tesla is due for a bounce and if it does bounce it will be a big one. However I am not sure if you guys caught that 1245pm pump on tesla but it got an “upgraded” buy rating that sent it on a nice huge pump for about 2 hours however by EOD it started to sell off once again. I actually am a little surprised to see the fact that even that “good news” couldn’t hold tesla up. That shows there is a lot more weakness (probably thanks to the twitter dead) then the technical show. At this point tesla is in a no play zone for me or at least a tread extremely light zone. Overall I do think we see some downside on tesla due to the weakness we are seeing but it very well unless there is a news dump could get a sympathy rally with the markets. Once we do pick a direction though (overall market with CPI) I feel like tesla could be the better play IF we expect downside. With tesla still being the highest off its 52week low I would be surprised to not see tesla with the twitter situation see a new low if we get a bad CPI and markets chose to dump. 

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX is still maintaining support at that 28.4 level I mentioned I was watching closely. The VIX is actually in a consolidation period itself now. With 29.9 to 33 being its revert to mean range. I would like to see the VIX break under 28.4 before im overly bullish on this market but I would also like to see the VIX close a candle over 33 before I suspect we push for a new 52week low. 

10% challenge- 

Overall good day with low trades again. I had those nice winning tesla calls this morning and was able to do 3 really nice SPX put scalps all within the first hour of the day. Which im thankful for because from there we just pretty much chopped in that range and nothing looked really good.

Note- not included in here is my $1 winning accidental Apple calls and my closed breakeven Apple puts. 

I will be gone tomorrow with the kiddos for a school event tomorrow. I am hoping to trade the EOD but I am not sure if that’s going to happen or not. 

Also as a heads up to everyone I will be out of town Wednesday, Thursday and Friday next week. There will NOT be daily TAs posted on those days and there will NOT be a weekly TA post next week. This week there will be a TA post though! I will keep an eye on the markets and if anything looks decent I will post some swings. Tuesday night in the server ill have something post for CPI too!

Later, it was confirmed that Musk has sent Twitter a letter, according to which he intends to proceed to close the Twitter transaction on the original terms. For the last several months, Musk tried to pull out of the buyout deal due to ongoing disagreement over the number of spam and bot accounts on the site, prompting a lawsuit regarding the takeover.

According to Reuters, Musk's changed decision over the deal made Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) investors fear that the billionaire, who sold over $15 billion worth of Tesla shares earlier in the year to fund the deal, was spreading himself too thin.

According to Dan Ives from Wedbush, Musk’s interest in closing the deal would weigh on Tesla’s shares. ""We see lingering impacts from Musk stock sales as a drag dissipating but the big worry is Musk juggling too many balls at the same time,"" Ives said.

I am leaning with essentially an inside day on SPY but tech looking pretty strong (apple specifically) and after a very deep red open and massive recovery even going green at open point that we are going to finish this week out green and next week see a retrace in preparation for CPI. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6plwqaur1s91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28fcc4b885eae5ad97eb97897c617c70e1e94e3a

Spy had broken the previous V bottom support but now we have this v bottom support. We are looking at a pretty fat bodied doji. This should with the two day push, daily 8ema support retest and holding, 370 range support test hold and briefly breaking over 378 before closing just under it provide upside for tomorrow. This to me was a bullish day. We looked extremely doomish this morning and then the bulls stepped in and let this rally almost all day. EOD drop was most likely profit takers. 

Key resistance bulls need to conquer tomorrow is the 378 and the daily 20ema. The next major resistance that we will likely push for is 382.1 which puts us through the black bear channel and puts us in line to Friday or next week test the blue bear channel that dates back to August. As long as bulls continue to defend that 370.6 level like they did today I am biased to the upside. 

Key support- 373.5 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 366.7

Key resistance- 378 -&gt; 379.8 (black bear channel) -&gt; 382.1 -&gt; 386.4

If we look at SPY weekly you can see that there is a pretty big case that we are going to test 3985.2 resistance we also have a very convincing V bottom forming along with retaking the weekly 200ema. If the bulls can take back that weekly 8ema and close over 385.2 this week then that should provide a lot of upside for next week especially with a bullish CPI.

Futures put in quite the range from 3734 to 3820 today. Futures is currently sitting right at that key 3805 resistance. With a dragonfly doji we should expect upside here. Key v bottom support will be at 3805. With a back test of 3735 previous resistance that should provide a big support base going forward. 

Support- 3805-&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735

Resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925

Apple looked stronger then the rest of the market all day today. Even this morning when SPY and Tesla were selling off apple was very delayed in its sell off. The other actually impressive thing is that Apple daily candle closed as a bullish engulfing candle at 0.21% when yesterday was a 2.56% green day. Apple also perfectly back filled its gap which should allow for further upside movement. If bulls can retake that key 149.3 resistance that was heavy support previously that would be very bullish going forward. 

Key support- 146 -&gt; 144.2 -&gt; 141.4

Key resistance- 147.7 (blue bear channel) -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.8

My tesla pattern that I called out 2 weeks ago when it hit 312 has finally played out completely as far as I am concerned. The low average prior to the move up was 222 and the high average was 242 with 234 being the privot point. With a test and pretty impressive bounce off 233.27 today I actually am expecting quite a bit of upside for tesla eow and even next week. 

Tesla is down 18% in 5 days, 20% in 6 days and 26% in 11 days... In my opinion it is due for a bounce. I believe yesterday before the Twitter news dropped tesla actually was going for a relief bounce closer to 260. I do believe eventually this downside play needed to happen but now its happened we should be looking for upside. As long as Apple and Spy as pushing tesla should push with it. With the closing of a pretty large dragonfly doji after a massive sell off I am looking for that bounce this week on Tesla. 

Another key thing is that the 5 day long (6 tomorrow) resistance line is in play and unless tesla opens under 239.4 (-0.6%) and holds red all day then we will break that resistance and we should see further upside. There is a small amount of room for the huge falling wedge to play out one more day to the downside and test 226 support but I favor with SPY and Apple looking strong that we do bounce. However, if Apple and SPY come out weak tomorrow like today we should see the 220s hit. 

If the upside doesn’t play out intraweek I suspect it plays out next week. 

Support- 234.6 -&gt; 226.4 -&gt; 222

Resistance- 239.4 -&gt; 242.3 -&gt; 249.2 -&gt; 254.7

The VIX continues to be overall undecided on what it wants to do holding over that key 28.4 pivot level. However we saw a back test of the daily 8ema resistance which did hold and show sell off into EOD. I suspect the VIX to break under that 28.4 level tomorrow which should provide upside potential for SPY. 

10% challenge-

Another pretty killer day for me today. Most of it came from Swings though. I struggled this morning with the techicals which looking back makes sense because I was attempting to find scalps prior to the v bottom rally. Technicals this morning and early afternoon once again were out of wack but by EOD were playing nicely again.

524,1664992569,xwhhp4,1,"The sole reason why he is buying Twitter is probably only because his lawyers advised that Twitter probably had a very solid case against him and that the likelihood of him successfully winning the lawsuit would fail.

Accounting for the expenses of the lawyers and legal fees, Musk probably realized he was shit out of luck and announced that he would buy Twitter at his original offer.

Exhibits on how you can quantify this (not the correct term, but you get what I’m saying)

Exhibit 1 - The guy went on a social media bender to discredit Twitter and to justify his reasoning on why he revoked his offer.

If he meant to purchase Twitter and fulfil his proposal, he would not have deliberately try and tarnish Twitters “reputation” and “business operation flaws” such as things like 2/3rds of the users being bots. There was no benefit for him doing this as the deal was already in place to buy Twitter at $44B. Tanking the price would not have benefited him in any way.

Exhibit 2: He knew he would lose the lawsuit and calculating the costs of his legal expenses and the duration of the lawsuit which could result in years of deliberation (potentially) may have outweighed the benefits of seeking a solution through the courts, which again, was probably very unfavourable for Elon.

Exhibit 3: He recently posted that acquiring Twitter was an accelerant to his everything app “X”, which is just horse shit wrapped around more horse shit to probably stave off a large negative response from his current Tesla investors.

Exhibit 4: He’s paying more then like 30% of Twitters actual fair market value.

Exhibit 5: Elon has had a lot of successful business ventures, but has equally had a lot of ventures which did not amount to very much at all.

The Twitter acquisition was all smoke and mirrors and could very well amount to nothing in the future. (As in being an unsuccessful business venture/acquisition)

I think he is trying to do some damage control here to avoid his current investors from flaking after removing $44B of his investment in Tesla to buy Twitter.

I’m sure he realizes this mistake and that it could have a very large negative impact with regards to his Tesla investors and his business decisions.

Twitter shares jumped more than 22 per cent to end at $52.00 on Tuesday, after a securities filing showed Musk intends to go ahead with his April offer of $44 billion to take the company private, signaling an end to a legal battle that could have forced Musk to pay up.

Icahn paid in the mid-$30s a share for the stake, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The estimated profit for Icahn Enterprises LP could exceed $250 million, it added.

Icahn made the investment on the belief that Tesla Inc chief Musk wouldn't go through a trial that he looked likely to lose, the report said. He also believed that the stock was worth close to the mid-$30s in the long term.

Other investors, including D.E. Shaw Group and Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC, also placed bets on Twitter shares in recent months and could make sizable gains as well, according to the report.

Twitter shares were halted after Bloomberg reported that Musk plans to go through with his acquisition at $54.20 a share.

The stock jumped 22% after it reopened.

Elon Musk has reversed course and is again proposing to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Twitter shares closed up more than 22% on the news.

The social media company issued a statement saying it had received the letter and said, “The intention of the Company is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share.”

A deal could happen as soon as Friday, sources told CNBC. The stock was halted earlier in the day after Bloomberg first reported on the Tesla CEO’s plans to go forth with his deal to acquire the company.

The SEC filing says Musk sent a letter to Twitter on Monday, notifying the company of his intent to proceed with the transaction agreed upon on April 25, the day the deal was publicly announced.

Here’s the letter that Musk’s lawyer, Mike Ringler of Skadden Arps, sent to Twitter’s lawyers on Oct. 3:

*Gentlemen:*

*On behalf of X Holdings I, Inc., X Holdings II, Inc. and Elon R.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

Stocks extended their recovery from deeply oversold levels, with traders debating whether central banks' aggressive stance should be moderated to avoid a hard landing.

The S&amp;P 500 experienced its best two-day gain since April 2020. Tesla rose even after Elon Musk resurrected his $44 billion bid for Twitter, which rose 22%. In addition to the equity short squeeze, soft economic data gave bulls reason to be optimistic about policy. Job openings in the United States have fallen to a 14-month low, which may coincide with the Federal Reserve's concern about a hot labor market. Bond yields fell in tandem with the dollar.

The debate over peak hawkishness has heated up following a dovish surprise from Australia's Central Bank and bond purchases by the Bank of England. The concept of a Fed pivot, on the other hand, has been met with skepticism. For one thing, there is a widespread belief that little has fundamentally changed to sway policymakers away from their primary goal of lowering inflation.

We are in the 378 - 382 range where I’d look to short to 330 ish or next leg down. Like to see how far it runs this week.

543,1664917122,xvqiin,1,"What an interesting day that we just had today… There is a lot to unpack today. The first thing I want to touch on is the daily range of SPY today. Lets take a look 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7n48fhiprur91.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1002362aaa2287d0547940f94dd8d1aef1d228f8

According to the data that brokers supply us… SPY saw a range of $11.43 with a LOD of 366.57 and a HOD of 377.66, however, SPYs actual LOD is 372.31 and a range of $5.69. So what does this mean? Well the last times this happened I coined it the “phantom range” and everytime it has happened the price of SPY has hit that level either intraday or the next day. This most likely is dark pool prints. 

Today was also extremely interesting when we look at the buy pressure, and TRIN. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zcapwwxprur91.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e5dc94bc25c3d7a7ca6e9a840e1412bbf4c1cf

Left side is todays market data which shows that we had a legit buy pressure of almost 2500:1 on SPY this morning and our trin was 0.21 (extreme imbalanced). Then we take a look at yesterday and our buy pressure on that massive run up was 9.72 and our TRIN was 5.05 (also hella imbalanced). 

This is officially the biggest two day rally that SPY has had all year and is the biggest two day rally since April 2020… so what comes next? 

Well lets look at WHY the market is even rallying like this… the CNBC current news cycle is set on repeat of “the fed is going to pivot, December is likely the last rate hike…” is this true? No most likely not… JPOW was very clear that we would NOT see a pivot or rate pauses until 2024 most likely. But with BOE and now Austria slowing its rate hikes/ starting QE… markets are rallying on this news. 

There is a chance we are about to go on a massive rally for the next 2 months till the November rate hike and JPOW finally talks again. That or we are seeing an extreme bear market dead cat bounce and the shows about to come to and end soon. Most of the bear market bounces this year are around $20 for low to high… we from Fridays low at $20.96. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eoefi5fqrur91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7b12d0ed958d1707c38d02a8dc30dc7f4e8775

Okay here is the above chart with less lines to make it clear on what im trying to show… We are looking like we are in a pattern just like the March to may sell off followed by an aggressive rally that led to consolidation and then a bigger dump (when CPI hit). I wonder if this pattern is about to play out again. That dump was a bounce form the 75% retracement to the 50% retracement… consolidation then dump to the 2022 bear channel support (around 330-340 depending on timing). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3pl1q2xqrur91.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ce5cf94e8207fc4a517888cbb9e379cba0e4c05

Today we saw SPY with a massive gap up (however, due to the phantom print this gap is now covered) over the daily 8ema and we stopped right at the 20ema. Most of these dead cat bounces have also stopped at the daily 20ema. So we are at a major pivot point here. 

There was on the 15min chart 14 attempts to break 377.3 resistance before it finally in the last minute popped through and closed over it. 

If we see a 3rd day to this rally I will look for resistance of the black bear channel to be tested at 382.2 which is also next resistance. The one thing I am seeing is that this looks very similar to the September 7th to September 12th dead cat bounce. If we look at the stochastics also you can see that we are hitting the same overbought levels that we did back then. While we might get one more push up I do suspect we see downside the end of the week. In order to trust this rally I would like to see 370.6 support back tested and held. 

Key support- 375.4 (black support line vbottom) -&gt; 372.4 -&gt; 370.7 -&gt; 366.7

Key resistance- 378 -&gt; 381.4 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.2

Futures did break through its key black falling wedge resistance. The next major resistance would be up in the 4000s which uses the august and September peaks. Futures also rejected the daily 20ema at the EOD. Unless futures opens green and never loses 3805 support we are going to see that support line broken finally and that could lead to more downside. 

Key support- 3805 (black v bottom) -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735

Key resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925

&amp;#x200B;

I am seeing a hanging man candle formed on the Apple daily chart with a rejection of the Daily 8ema. With the phantom print on SPY we are seeing a massive hanging man on spy and the similar one on Apple. Look at the May 17th candle on spy for an idea of what COULD happen. 

Apple rejected 146 9 times before it finally closed a 15min candle over it EOD. However, even with that close it still is below its daily 8ema. Due to the daily candle structure unless apple opens over 149.4 (2.2% green and holds that all day it will break support and should open the downside). With SPY and Apple I am looking for a double top at 378 and a double top at 146 with a bigger retracement. 

Blue bear channel resistance comes in at 148.8 tomorrow which is just below key resistance of 149.4. 

Key support- 149.4 (black v bottom support) -&gt; 142.5 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 146 -&gt; 147.6 -&gt; 149.4 (major resistance) 

&amp;#x200B;

And then there was Tesla… you gotta love the way this stock moves. Tesla actually looked fairly bullish this morning breaking over yesterdays HOD and looking to test that red falling wedge resistance near 260. However, then ole ELON decided he is gonna buy the twitterpade and well we saw tesla go for $10.86 sell off in less than 15minutes and a total drop of $13.25 over 1.5 hours before it actually attempted to gather some support EOD. I was blessed enough to have some Tesla puts but not blessed enough to get an IV pump on them… Despite teslas impressive drop it actually closed a green day and was able to get over 248.7 resistance that it struggled at for over 11 candles before finally like SPY and Apple EOD was able to close over them. 

Tesla is peculiar. As it still remains one that has the most to lose as it’s the furthest from its 52week low. Tesla has now also suffered back to back days of “bad news”. Being in the inverse head and shoulders pattern the pattern needs to see 220 to “complete” I do suspect we could see it play out this week. 

Today could have definitely been seen as a “rest” day after Tesla got absolutely beat down yesterday. Breaking 242.5 will be the confirmation of downside to come and a close over 255 would signal a possible bigger bounce to test that black bear channel. A breaking of that red support for the falling wedge will be an early signal of the reversal. 

Key support- 242.5 -&gt; 237.3 -&gt; 231 (black bear support)

Key resistance- 250 -&gt; 252.4 (red resistance falling wedge) -&gt; 255 -&gt; 260.6 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4dbn9zsrur91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=408068e51fe535684efd9bfeb0cc6d54d2369cb8

The VIX in all reality did nothing today. It did hold key 28.3 support and the daily 20ema. However, it closed under 30 for the first time since September 23rd. One thing that I am seeing though is a gravestone doji candle body. This appears to have occurred in similar fashion back on September 9th which then led to a massive upturn (granted this was CPI day). 

There is a very big potential with the VIX not unwinding at all on this massive green day on SPY that we could see the VIX revert back to 31-32 tomorrow which would take SPY down and the markets with it. 

10% challenge-

Some of my least favorite days to trade are days we have massive gap ups at open… when we have back to back days of gap ups with extremely weird technical (trin, buy pressure, vold, etc. etc.) I know there is little risk to reward. I played a morning tesla put when I saw weakness in Tesla and was reward thanks to musk but I believe either way I would have been by EOW. From there I didn’t play much else besides closing my 28dte call on SPY and playing one quick SPX scalp. 

A great trader KNOWS when the technical do not favor their strategy. An even greater trader knows when not to trade and that’s there will always be another day to trade. Today to me was a clear day 

Youtube will be up later tonight!

Overall on Apple and SPY there are some major bull milestones hit, however, Tesla had a VERY rough day today…

Taking a look at SPY daily chart here we broke through that blue falling wedge. This is the resistance line we have been trading under since before CPI. However, we attempted to break through the daily 8ema resistance which also was key resistance at 368.1. While we were able to peak out head over it momentarily we saw a really good sized pullback EOD to close under the daily 8ema and soft resistance at 366.8. Overall this is a bearish finish to a very green day and honestly this reminds me almost perfectly of last Wednesday. 

If we can get a continuation rally and close over 370.6 tomorrow which breaks the overall black bear channel then I will be bullish going forward. However, if we reject the black bear channel resistance at 366.8 tomorrow and start to sell off there is a good chance we will see a bigger sell off the rest of the week. At a minimum I wouldn’t be surprised to see a back test of support at 362.9. If bulls can defend that then we might see more upside, however, lose that and especially lose 360 again and I suspect more downside to come. 

Key support- 362.9 -&gt; 361.1 -&gt; 357.2 -&gt; 352.3

Of all the charts Apple looks to be the most bullish in my opinion. But that also makes a lot of sense when you look at how absolutely bloodied Apple was last week. After a 4 day 11% sell off Apple finally found support at 138.2 forming a double bottom bullishly engulfing daily candle. Apple broke through key 142.5 resistance however, in the end closed below it. That will be key resistance to watch tomorrow. 

If bulls can defend 141.4 tomorrow after breaking through that 5 day long aggressive resistance line that it struggled at all week last week that would be pretty bullish going forward. Assuming bulls can keep up this momentum we could see Apple push back to the 150s this week. 

Much like SPY/ Futures rejection at the daily 8ema I would like to see Apple close a candle over the daily 8ema before I get too excited about going long on Calls. 

Key support- 141.4 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 142.5 -&gt; 146.2 (daily 8ema)

On September 21st I said that with the rejection at 312 there was a possibility that Tesla could see a retest of support at 220-240. Well I would not have expected this even though I saw the technical setup for it.

It appears to me what is happening is Tesla is about to find its bottom support much like SPY and Apple presumably did last week. There is a potential we see some more downside on Tesla before it pushes up again. 

There is a very aggressive black dotted support line that’s two days old now that we will look for Tesla to take out and from there it needs to take out that red solid resistance line. IF we can see those two resistance lines taken out it will be a good time to go long on some Tesla calls. However, if we see rejections at those resistance lines then we should assume further downside to go. Also, if today really was just a bull trap and a fake rally like last Wednesday I still believe Tesla has the most to lose with it still being 15% off its 52 week low. If SPY and Apple retreat tomorrow I would be interested in some puts targeting 222 support. 

If the off chance that tesla has some massive recovery day of 7%+ tomorrow, gap fills and rejects 

Key support- 237.3 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 207.2

The VIX is hinting at more bullish continuation to come, however it still fails to close below 30. I am keeping a close eye on the VIX as you can see the candle from Wednesday on the VIX looks very similar. Today we are also forming a downward resistance line on the VIX now too. As long as that resistance holds, the VIX continues to close under the daily 8ema and preferably gets below 30 I will be more bullish going forward. 

As much as today was a huge green push and there are a lot of hints at bullish momentum attempting to take over and that we possible Friday did put the bottom in… Im still hesitant. If tomorrow can take out 370.6 on SPY, if tesla can bounce green and if Apple can take out its daily 8ema at 146.2 then with the VIX closing under 30 (preferably under 29) I will be more bullishly biased going forward. However, with that being said knowing we are only 3% from the 52week low on SPY and knowing that we are at the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel I would not take Puts here except as an intraday swing. 

I do think that puts overnight tonight is a high probability play just after such a big green day and TRIN being extremely outta wack all day we naturally could see a small retracement to retest supports before continuing up. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8gi5njq6pnr91.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82da8e607a06ec90a4c1e3a8e5ae97f80722262c

Something else I actually completely failed to think about last week is that this is the week before the next CPI reading. Currently they are at a consensus of 8.1% and a forecast of 8.3%. This would mean this would be the third CPI in a row to show a decline. Now granted CORE cpi does matter as we saw back on September 13th but With the markets being forward looking we could much like the September CPI be seeing a small push up in anticipation of this CPI. 

As much as we logically know the FED will not pivot (really they should not pivot) after BOE last week did QE and now if inflation truly peaking if we get another good CPI (especially if CORE is down) we could see markets go on another rally much like July. While its illogical given the overall market and economy if the markets get a whisper of Fed going Dovish or pivoting we are going to see a pretty impressive rally much like July. At least until either the FED says don’t be dumb that’s not happening or until the next CPI in November and FOMC. However, if CPI comes in hotter especially CORE come October 13th we are most likely going to see the actual bottom get put in. As markets will know Fed is going to have to go even more hawkish to tame inflation. 

10% challenge-

Overall all today was a great day for me. I played some nice SPX calls. I took profits really early on my plays as I wasn’t sure what we were going to see when we opened that huge green pre market, especially with Tesla selling off. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kc7g97j7pnr91.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aca9330a20bbf6b34849d35e9ecb4241aa1cf63b

I closed some longer DTE swings I opened on Thursday and Friday last week. I honestly probably could have help all of these swings and been just fine but after a big 3% green day in the middle of a massive sell off its silly to not take profits. I did leave some 363C 28dte calls run though. 

Overall I was able to secure about 2x my monthly goal today. Going to be in humble mode and conservation mode the rest of the week. 

The #1 thing I see people do is they have a killer hour, day, week, or month and then they get overconfident and trade away all their profits they just worked so hard to earn. 

This market is extreme volatile and will chew you up and spit you out faster then you can hit sell. Continue to conserve capital and trade lightly. Remember the goal of this bear market is to survive until things are better enough that we can more easily profit. We cant do that if we trade away all our money and profits. 

Youtube will be up later!

Annualized net income on CMG = approx 1 billion USD. 

Annualized net income on McD’s = approx 5.5 billion USD

MCD has a P/E ratio of 28.87. Arguably has way more in value with the likes of prime real estate too. 

Market cap of CMG = 41 billion USD

Market cap of McDonald’s = 172 billion uSD 

McDonald’s has a net income 5.5 times bigger than that of Chipotle so if you divide 172 (Market cap of mcdicks) into 5.5 you come up with 31 billion$. 

Therefore CMG is overvalued by 25% minimally right there with a true competitor and given the current macro Econ situation it’s still heavily overvalued as we know these places shouldn’t be trading with such high P/E ratios.

AUSTIN, Texas, October 2, 2022 – In the third quarter, we produced over 365,000 vehicles and delivered over 343,000 vehicles.

Historically, our delivery volumes have skewed towards the end of each quarter due to regional batch building of cars.  As our production volumes continue to grow, it is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost during these peak logistics weeks.  In Q3, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter.

So you missed Tesla, you missed GME, are you going to miss Palantir? I know I am risking a perma ban here (that is what it feels like if I bring the ticker symbol up for a split second). But I want to write a few points about Palantir and why the stock is heavily oversold.

This month alone Palantir signed contracts worth a total of about $700M+ in rev. A lot is still in the government (gov is still a money printer, if they get addicted to Palantir they cant go back, and they give of some junkie vibes). They are aiming for a revenue of about 1,9 B this year (Q1 was $446M and Q2 was $473M).

It is true that Palantir still is not profitable, and Karp says it will be in 2025 (people argue that if they stop the SBC program they would be already profitable). So okay 2 years no profit, I think Alex Karp is wrong here when you see that in one month Palantir is able to fork in 700M$ of signed deals you can only imagine what the company could do in 2023. I think the sales team is heating up, for commercial clients this would be sufficient. I mean if you are a government you dont want to speak to a VP of sales but to the CEO, so I think Alex Karp is still closing the government deals and the sales team is picking up the commercial deals to relieve some pressure from Karp.

So Palantir has made his way into western governments to make money and get them addicted to the product (some deals they signed this month are long term and end by 2028 for example). But next to this Palantir has got a nice war chest to get through these difficult times (bear market, war in Ukraine, inflation), because they got $2,4B in cash, no debt, option to withdraw $950M of credit (not from credit suisse lol), and $50,7 M of gold bars (dafuq). So no need for hedge funds to worry about the health of Palantir. 

So why wouldn't you YOLO into this stock?

3. Who will buy a truck that’s propulsion is down hill?
4. Company is losing money every quarter.

BUT if we take a closer look at this beaten down company we can see the following facts. 

1. A new factory has been built and is capable of 2500 BEV trucks per year. 
2. Phase 2 of the factory on pace to be completed in 2023 which will add 20k capacity.
3. Confirmed orders and rave reviews from customers. 
4. Successful Beta testing of the Hydrogen trucks and partnerships with TC energy to build put infrastructure. 
5. $3 hydrogen credits and energy partnerships to bring the cost of hydrogen in par or cheaper than Gas 
6. Budweiser, Walmart and other large fleets testing vehicles. 
7. Revenue growth figures over or near 100% QoQ/YoY
8. Trial ending this month and the possibility Nikola will collect 150mm from Trevor. 
9. New CEO Michael Lohscheller to take over in 2023. His past experience as CFO at Mitsubishi and Volkswagen as well as expertise in scaling manufacturing. 
10. Partner with IVECO to also scale in Europe. 


All this for 1.5bn valuation and $3.5 per share. This stock may very well keep going down but if they continue to grow their sales not even the Fed and shorts can keep this company’s stock price rolling down hill.

576,1664636636,xsxjr0,1,"After seeing A.I. day from Tesla yesterday I am convinced Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world in the next decade and possibly for decades to come. Part of me thinks this is all part of Elon's plan to take over the world. Maybe he's been planning this since he first dreamed of making electric cars. After watching terminator he concluded that electric cars were the right path towards human robots. He even made it a point to emphasize than he shouldn't be allowed to do what he wants pointing out that it was good Tesla was a public company because they can kick him out. I think he himself thinks this is a step into some murky water. To me it seems pretty clear Tesla's pace of innovation is going to dominate the markets in the coming years robot or not. You can see the robot team is excited for this project and they're definitely going to make it happen. I know everyone likes to think of apocalyptic scenarios like IRobot when thinking about intelligent A.I. but I think more of bender. Seeing the amount of love and passion these people are putting into this creation I find it hard to believe robots would want to destroy us.  Imo Tesla will have robots in mass production by the end of the decade. Even with reasonably low usability at a price point of 20k that is going to attract alot of consumer demand for these robots. If other companies don't start doing robotics at an accelerated rate Tesla is going to have a market dominance in many fields. What will tesla's marketcap be when it can create Optimus by the millions only 10 years from now? Especially if it has a monopoly/ far lead in this field. I just think tesla has reached a point where the positive feedback loop of technology/data has reached a point where other companies will lag beyond the point of catching up. If Tesla bot is extremely useful it essentially creates a near unlimited demand. Tesla ripped the business plan right out on MOM Corp off futurama.

It appears the trend of a red open and a red close is holding true now for 4 quarters in a row. Something to keep in mind for next time. 

The question with what looked like a strong morning that turned weak and had a lot of weakness EOD with stocks like Apple still in a massive sell off… whats next? Is the bottom in? or did SPY just start its next leg down? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here you can see we broke through both supports of that red diamond I was talking about. In theory that should lead to a bigger downside move. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ehc0l0jc2r91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2395343f4a8b93818a94826d5b64e106fa58a8bf

Here is the cleaned up chart for SPY now. You can see the blue falling wedge is still entact and the black bear channel also is still intact. What I am seeing forming on the markets here and I mentioned this yesterday was that 360-370 was clear consolidation and until we see one of those levels broken we should be patient. Now that the 360 downside has not only been broken but it was closed below the favor is there to downside. However, the issue we have here is that we have been selling off non-stop for a month now. 7 of the last 8 days have been red (-8.3%),  11 of the last 14 days have been red (-11.5%), 17 of the last 25 days have been red (-15%) and finally 21 of the last 32 days have been red (-16.9%). 

That is a ton of selling and this has SPY closing a daily candle below the 75% retracement (blue dotted line) of this 2022 bear channel for the first time since June. However, this still does not feel like for SPY capitulation. This is just a slow boring bleed. This isnt the -5% like we had at CPI this is just a slow bleed and the VIX is not hitting those capitulation levels. We are either starting our next leg down and next week is going to be the week the blood hits the markets with VIX closing over 40 or the bottom fell out here with quarterly options expiration and we will see a push up from here. Honestly I went into today and was bullish most of the day but now I am worried with SPY closing below the weekly 200ema for the first time since the 2020 covid crash… however, once we closed a candle below the weekly 200ema that was bottom… 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9dbe1xijc2r91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cd0f102c9617770c1d04fdc29a80e7091eb3c2a

Closing a candle below the weekly 200ema and the full body being below it is very worrisome for sure. That EOD sell off on spy does have me wondering if we come out swinging bloody on Monday. However, with this weeky candle body we could see a true double bottom of 357 and push green. SPY remains in the black bear channel and has now an intense blue resistance line which forms a falling wedge. 

Key supports for next week- 357 -&gt; 350.2 -&gt; 348 -&gt; 346 (black bear channel support) -&gt; 342 -&gt; 338 (green 2022 bear channel support) 

Key resistance for next week- 353.4 (black falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 357 -&gt; 366.6 (weekly 200ema) 

What I am seeing that unless SPY opens down 1.1% Monday and holds there all week for a push lower to 346 then we will open persumably taking out that blue resistance and that should provide some upward momentum. However, unless bulls can really gather momentum and take out the weekly 200ema at 366.6 then it is likely short lived upward momentum. With 6 of the last 7 weeks closing red we are on pace to test the 10 out of 11 red weeks we saw from march to june. If that is the case we truly could see 330 by end of october.

Futures also broke through its diamond pattern today and broke out of its similar consolidation from 3650 to 3730. 

I will be watching that blue support line closely as we have 3 touches on it so that should be something that is able to withstand a test. Current futures is doing its best to close over 3600. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w9x2hajkc2r91.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6450539058961e3b2aaa912d2b08390cb5261e83

Similar idea here on Futures weekly here. We are seeing that the blue falling wedge is about to come to an end next week when we open. Now mind you we could always false breakout and then drop from there but SPY and Futures patterns are pointing to upside from a technical stand point. Same thought process here is that unless we open pretty deep red (about -1.4%) on futures and hold there we will see that blue rising wedge broken. 

Key support- 3600 -&gt; 3545 -&gt; 3528 -&gt; 3500 (black bear channel support) 

Key resistance- 3545 (blue falling wedge) -&gt; 3680 (weekly 200ema) -&gt; 3705

Apple to me looks like this week was “capitulation” I think investors finally realized tech is not safe. The one kinda impressive thing about it though is how dramatic the drop on Apple has been in comparison to SPY. So Apple dropped 10.9% or $16.72 in 4 days while SPY only fell 4.1% or $$15.26 in the same time frame. This seems like a rotation to risk off from me. As I have been mentioning for the last two week is that Tech was holding up impressively well compared to SPY that was getting beat up. 

There is a chance people rotated our of non-tech stuff for the last two weeks and finally are rotating out of tech now too. They say TECH is always the last to fall… Currently Apple is only 6.5% from its 52week low. 

While this impressive sell off make me think we should see a bounce on Apple I would be very careful buying calls until we see that red resistance line broken. It attempted today and I was very convinced today it was going to bounce and that the markets were going to find support. However, it rejected hard at that 143.1 resistance and dumped impressively from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Watching the weekly you can see we have a pretty intense blue bear channel and a lesser intense black bear channel. 

Support- 138 -&gt; 135.5 (black bear channel support) -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 131.9 (blue bear channel support)

Resistance- 141.6 -&gt; 145.6 -&gt; 149.2

If we believe that the tech dominos are about to fall then my prediction last week when Tesla rejected 312 and I noted this blue arrow inverse head and shoulders… tesla just might actually see that 220-240 support range. Tesla is impressively still 22% off its 52 week low here. On the daily chart we saw Tesla close below 270 for the first time since July. There is a potential of a support bounce at 258.6, however, if Tesla loses that support next week I do suspect the bigger downside is coming. While comparatively tesla looked much stronger then Apple today (especially this morning) as long as Apple is selling off Tesla will get sympathy weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla weekly closed out in a deadzone from 258.2 to 272. There is not a lot of price action here since March. However the biggest weekly takeaway is that this is the first time we have see Tesla weekly candle close below 270 since July. In addition we did have a hard rejection at that 300 level. 

With that blue resistance line I will be keeping an eye on that. If Tesla is to break through that line at some point next week that would be my signal of upside to come. Until then I do suspect we may actually see further downside. Generally speaking a gravestone doji in a downtrend is seen as continuation now reversal. 

If Tesla loses 258.2 I would think the sell off will be hot and heavy down. Think flash crash (most likely coupled with a Apple flash crash to 52 week low. 

Key support- 258.2 -&gt; 248 (black June recovery support line) -&gt; 244.6 -&gt; 222.8

Key resistance- 265.4 (blue resistance) -&gt; 272.1 -&gt; 287.9

The VIX once again is less help then help when it comes to trading this 2022 bear market. On one hand this morning it was unwinding, broke through the daily 8ema and broke the rising wedge which accelerated this sell off before FOMC. However, by mid day the VIX said nah fam just kidding and ripped back to 33.25 before it unwound EOD. 

That is where today is interesting as we have a red VIX day with a pretty large red SPY day. 

The big VIX spike on September 28th to me appears to tell that the bottom is in for the time being, however, IF markets “agree” with the negative sentiment of the markets we COULD see the VIX unwind while markets continue to drop. 

Overall there are a lot of stocks hitting their 52 week lows and hitting lows that have not been seen since 2020. Overall I think we are getting closer and closer to the next bounce. In my opinion much like the May 20th to June 8th bounce I think we are due for another bounce before a bigger leg down takes place. Comparatively this is one of the bigger overall sell offs that we have seen this year next to the June CPI/ FOMC flash crash we had. 

I think if you were to start DCAing into a small 30-60dte call position here you would be well rewarded in time, however, I do have this eerie feeling in the back of my head that next week is going to come out blood red and we are going to see full on capitulation (think covid/ 2008 crash -20% week). However, to experience a week like that we NEED a bigger catalyst. We need that market news that hits that makes everyone go oh no. its time to sell everything and get out while I still have anything left. I don’t think we are there yet there is a lot of hope in this market and world still. And lets be honest we are not the same levels we were during covid and 2008 crash. 

This is one of those times where it is better NOT to swing and its better to miss 3-4% on the upside move then be early and see another 5-6% down before it bounces. SPY and markets continue to teeter on the edge of the cliff. 

10% Challenge- 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was “off” but had a tesla swing I averaged down (WAY too late) and was able to close out in the morning before I had to actually leave for the day. I am glad I did too because I really thought when I left I was leaving in a bullish momentum market and when I checked back later I was dead wrong. Markets took a turn. Thankful for not getting greedy there. 

This was my best week I have had since May profits wise, however, comparatively since my position size was about 2-3x bigger back in May this comparatively is the best week I have had this year yet. 

This is definitely one of my strongest months I have had too hitting just under $10k profits and averaging 83.6% over the whole month.

The messages were part of court filings and revealed Thursday as part of the pre-trial discovery process in the court battle over whether Musk has to follow through on the merger agreement he signed to buy Twitter. Twitter and Musk are due in court Oct. 17.

The stream of messages includes Musk's exchanges with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, current CEO Parag Agrawal, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and many more.

Elon Musk wants to get out of buying Twitter. A whistleblower's claims might help him

The court documents show Musk making overtures to Twitter, discussing the importance of free speech, workshopping ideas on how to improve the platform, assembling the financing for the deal, and then deliberating over how to make the struggling company profitable.

Ann Lipton, a professor of business law at Tulane University, says some corporate cases yield ""juicy and embarrassing internal emails."" But Twitter's case is extra entertaining because Musk is such a colorful figure and Twitter is a high profile company with outsize influence.

Jack Dorsey, who founded Twitter and stepped down in November 2021, discussed taking Twitter private with Musk in late March.

But that's just contradictory with **everything** that has been said around the auto industry lately. 

Between the dire warnings of FedEx, Nike and Apple, who are warning of a big overall slowdown in sales due to inflation and supply chain issues, how the hell the Auto industry, the most textbook definition of a discretionary spending, going to survive this ? 
Ford and GM sure as fuck hasn't, but i think they still have some room to fall given that recently, in an interview with Yahoo Finance he has said that he expects supply chain + hiring problems to continue into 2024.  

Then there's Tesla. Insane valuation, still very very expensive cars in an inflationary context where people would rather buy food than cars.

There is a likely scenario that those Pre-orders of model 3s and Ys, start getting canceled, and we get a Netflix 2.0. 
The way I see it, Tesla and in particular Elon have built up a lot of expectation heading into what seems like the toughest monetary policy in the last decade. They have no room for error. If there is just a hint that the number of cars are going to miss the mark due to some issues, investors will most likely be rushing for the exit.

*Processing img dpjiu3nnewq91...*

Hey everyone,

I wrote a post not too long ago talking about how we shouldn't fight the fed. In the comments I describe the short positions that had been building against $TSLA and $AAPL. I think a lot of you now understand why Wallstreet was gearing up for war on retail's two favorite stocks.

Now I am going to tell you what their goal probably is and to summarize what the economic trends we're seeing in the consumer based on earnings reports.

Buckle up, you probably want to both hear and not hear what I have to say.

Inflation -- People Are Making Decisions, ""Do I buy store brand or do I buy cheaper?""

So, inflation. The Big I-Word. It's been a disaster for the market. A genie that should never have been let out of the bottle, but it is and we're not done with it yet (clearly). There are a lot of signs emerging that it's affecting the consumer. While it's not affecting the net spend from consumers--yet--it is affecting their choices.

Take $WMT. WMT saw a pretty good upswing in it's earnings last report with quite a good beat, but why is this? Aren't things horrible for retail stores? Well, if you think so, you'd be right. But one person's loss is another person's game. When you're entering tough times and things are expensive you do what you have to do, you buy cheaper. You go for store brand products. Instead of shopping at your local high end Bashes grocery store or Super Target, you hit up Wal Mart, Costco, places that have their entire model built on stretching a consumer/shopper's dollar to the max.

This was our first big key to what's going on. Let's talk about the next.

The Bullwhip Effect

&amp;#x200B;

[What the Books say is happening. This is how you get a glut of inventory](https://preview.redd.it/2evme75dewq91.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f08fa1a17a7c191d0bf059cff198850d6fb56243)

Bullwhip Effect -- AKA Covid ""BUY IT ALL! WE'RE STUCK AT HOME!""

We're seeing a huge bullwhip effect in the market. Places are being flooded with inventory. Yes, this is old news, but it is also current news. $TGT's last quarter was the perfect example for how this god awful situation plays out. Companies ordered a ridiculous amount during the pandemic because all of us sat at home on our phones ordering everything we ever wanted in our lives. Because stocks were so low, places started to double, triple up on their orders in order to try and meet a new high demand that they were forecasting.

Well, it didn't last forever. Plus... this didn't help...

&amp;#x200B;

[Yeah... that's your stuff out there.](https://preview.redd.it/p50gpamfewq91.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b835ca06f519998080f9c16d8315ad5ef5c843ae)

Ship Congestion. That's your stuff out there. Sitting for months.

This stuff sat on boats for freaking months. You might say, 'Hey, Tay\_tay86, I know all this crap. Why are you telling me old news?"" Because guess what, it's here now. That stuff has been unloaded and sent to the stores.

But guess what? It's freaking late. Like really late.

So what does a company like $TGT do? Well, in their case they list on clearance. It costs money to have this crap around. Plus if it sits too long, it has to be completely written off. You know, red tag 80-90% clearance aka please get it out of my store. That gave $TGT a fat \~45% cut in EPS because they have to eat all of their costs associated with producing and then shipping that item at stupid high prices to your fat ass. If it takes too long, they get shellacked.

Here comes out next challenger... Nike. $NKE

&amp;#x200B;

[Here we go again...](https://preview.redd.it/uzj64zvgewq91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=177d873f7aa902a06d9ad318ac66bbac91030e0a)

Our old friend. Mr Highly Engineered Shoes Guyz

$NKE reported after the bell today. All eyes were definitely on them. They've been talking about this one all over the place so going in, it's a hot topic. Well, it's a pretty bad story.

There's a lot of similarities here. I highly encourage you to listen to their entire call.

Their margin's are compressed AF. 22% drop in profits is a pretty dire warning to unprofitable companies or ones that are barely profitable.

1. Any time a CEO/CFO is throwing out catch phrases after every BAD result is a sure fire sign that they are trying to distract you from the car wreck that is their report. I Counted at least 4-5 times of 'We're still the super cool choice for shoes' (Paraphrasing, clearly)
2. They suddenly have too much inventory. Sounds familiar? It should. That's why they are clearing out of the stock afterhours. They are forecasting a repeat of what $TGT just had. $NKE may have squeaked by at 0.93 EPS today, but the next one could be a real gut punch as they try to clear these shoes. Even worse than $TGT, they sell season specific items. This means some of this crap is probably summer oriented when we're going into fall and winter. Yeah, not a good situation. It could potentially be WORSE than what $TGT just experienced. Combine that with the drop in profits and Fx challenges, you've got a real problem.
3. China revenue dropped. I feel like that one didn't get the highlight it deserves. The CEO kept trying to amp up that China is hungry for sports themed stuff that they sell, but yet their revenue there dropped 13%. Didn't they roll out a lot of direct to consumer options? Well apparently they aren't biting. This is a very eerie warning.

Why?

Well, let's start to summarize. Hopefully you're still reading.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Cracking Of Apple](https://preview.redd.it/uppjfyxhewq91.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b327e0f44c102a34631d00e2fd295a0f94fd33aa)

The Cracking of $AAPL

We've had MULTIPLE warnings about China's demand for our multinational in the past few weeks. Let's list them out:

1. FedEx reported economic weakness in China. If anyone knows how things are going, it's the folks who are delivering stuff that businesses are selling.
2. Nike is reporting weaker revenue from China (where their stuff is basically made)
3. Apple is supposedly pulling back a prior manufacturing target by 5-10% due to a lack of demand in places like, you guessed it, China

Now apple's debatable because there's some reports that the Max is doing fine. However, I think that's probably a bullish dream. Their mainstream model is only doing as well as the first.

What's at fault? Honestly, probably the chips and overall market. Nothing inside the phone is dramatically different. It's a big nothing burger and there's not a lot of incentive to upgrade. If you do want to, you might as well shell out for the Max to actually get something.

I believe this is going to result in **a net loss of sales because not everyone will choose to buy expensive when the mainstream model is subpar.** **The upgrade is... minor.**

This is not a homerun for Apple. Wallstreet probably feels very confident about this behind closed doors, but not in public. That's why they've been building short positions against Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

[Closing Time](https://preview.redd.it/tje90u9kewq91.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbb27790f23e8301f7f07db945c1d28d76405ef5)

Closing out

Alright, so let's close this baby out. I know a lot won't read this, but hey, hope you do. If you had read my last one you would have made a killing betting against $AAPL this week.

So what's the trend we're seeing?

1. **There's too much stuff.**
2. **Luxuries are not the draw they once were. Things need to be noticeably different to get the $.**
3. **Because of inflation people (middle class) are choosing to shop at cheaper locations**
4. **Affordability is top of mind (See CarMax which I am not covering here)**

So this is it. This is all great for the battle against inflation, but it's bad news bears for your stocks. You're looking at potentially shaky EPS results as we head into this earnings season and the next. These are not single quarter problems. Inventories can take a long time to physically move through the system.

Which brings me to what this means:

We're probably going lower in the market.

Wall street is coming for retail. They know from all of the data and the clear charts that retail has piled into $AAPL and $TSLA as safety. They are building short positions against it because they have better info than we do. Rumors are already leaking that $TSLA could be approaching weak deliveries for a lot of the same reasons.

You've got Price and Earnings to every P/E ratio. Price has come down a lot, but now we're going to look at E heading south. There's two ways to skin a company.

Let's talk about $TSLA for a second.

&amp;#x200B;

[Tesla Is A Cult](https://preview.redd.it/t0zal9gpewq91.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6922c2439180b2800ab212b5f72dfd1257c23637)

The Cult Of Tesla

# Disclaimer

1. Look, I don't hide my feelings. I greatly dislike Tesla and their CEO Elon Musk. I don't trust him. I think he manipulates the market and uses it to empty his fans pockets
2. I think the cars are cheaply made with a lot of flaws.
3. I don't like cultish love for a human being

Elon has made a mistake. That mistake? Making promises he doesn't keep. There's 1 major promise that Elon should have kept: **Making An Affordable EV.**

I am not going to take you through the logic. It's up above. Read this and you'll understand why I am pointing a finger here. These cars are **EXPENSIVE** and they don't offer you a big new thing than the one you already have does. FSD COSTS EXTRA. These are **luxuries**. What do we know about luxuries? People are choosing to buy cheaper. Carmax DIRECTLY said that affordability is on people's mind for car shopping now. **Especially as interest rates soar making car financing WAY more expensive than it was a year ago.**

I believe this is going to bite Elon Musk right in his lying manipulative ass. His way out, pulling a huge rabbit out of the hat. This could happen soon, or it could happen next year, but it's coming for him.

**Keep in mind he's already tilted his hand calling Austin and Berlin's gigafactories cash burning machines.**

# Final Words

Wall street is coming for Apple. Wall Street is coming for Tesla. They know you're holding it. They are two, massive, giant piggy banks sitting in a market where the bears have eaten everything else alive. Every bear is starting to turn their heads and they are looking directly at a juicy, fat, pair of piggy banks.

When it's all done, the market is probably around 3100-3300 unless things get disorderly. I expect these two to lead us lower, because lets be honest, not much else can. These two have 'been holding the market up higher.

Further disclaimer: I have positions against AAPL and Tesla. I've been rolling them for a while. I won't share my exits, but here's proof that I am in what I say I am. I started these with 3k. Going strong so far.

Good luck out there. This is not an endorsement for you to copy me. I trade very actively and move very fluidly. Contact a professional if you want real financial advice. I am an amateur and this is my own take on the market. I am not responsible for whatever you choose to do. Be Safe.

I’d argue they’re the most under the radar green play on the market right now. If they don’t kill it as an individual business, you can bet your ass that they’ve got eyes on them as a potential acquisition target. 

With Ballie Gifford (aka a key Tesla backer), BlackRock, Tencent, and Palantir, you’ve got a recipe for something special about to happen.

Way under valued right now: current market cap is $600M. They’ve got MoU orders for 483 aircraft and the projected sale price is $4.5M per plane (my regard math puts that at ~$2.2B of sales (yes, I know it’s just MoU’s, but they’re ruthlessly meeting their targets). If we continue with my regard math then they’re undervalued by at least 3.6x (even more if you apply revenue multiples if you want to be extra regarded). 

TL;DR: this under the radar eVTOL will probably be a multi bagger in the next couple of years. Even sooner if the apes in this sub decide to invest in something other than GME or BBBY (doubtful though)

617,1664318233,xpv09i,1,"As exciting as it is to live through these “once in life time moments” they are getting quite old. Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row… This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. 

SPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I haven’t felt “capitulation” or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. 

CNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the “worst week of the year for stocks” with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently… and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with… I wonder how this week is going to finish out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. 

The one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didn’t just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row… I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. 

Support- 362.1 -&gt; 360.2 (red support) -&gt; 358.2 (blue support) -&gt; 355.4 -&gt; 352.3

Resistance- 364.3 -&gt; 365.6 (red resistance) -&gt; 368.2 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill)

Taking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. 

Key support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545

Key resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770

Looking at apple this morning once again… which has been trend for the last week… we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. 

I was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. 

The thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we haven’t hit capitulation and we haven’t been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish… this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. 

Key supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1

Key resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421f0e076579dbbf7cccfc8a56f8f154fa23a45e

Tesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. 

Tesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. 

Support- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) 

Resistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292

Just when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading… it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50… I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in.

I am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I haven’t really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. 

The next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. 

10% challenge-

You know honestly not my best day today… I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. 

From there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. 

This is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being “smarter” than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. 

I am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really don’t know where to go from here… but that’s why when in doubt we don’t swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. 

Overall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight.

619,1664286397,xph8t1,1,"Hey, I was interested, and I looked inside the Tesla reporting of crash data. 

[https://www.tesladeaths.com/](https://www.tesladeaths.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

All of this data came with something called an NHTSA Complaint Number, as well as a reporting date for the vehicle in question. One thing that was interesting to me, none of the data makes any sense to me.

The VIN numbers are coded in a very specific fashion. ""A manufacturer that builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as  the third digit and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a  second part of the identification.""

[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Vehicle\_Identification\_Numbers\_(VIN\_codes)/World\_Manufacturer\_Identifier\_(WMI)](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Vehicle_Identification_Numbers_(VIN_codes)/World_Manufacturer_Identifier_(WMI))

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla didn't start producing over 10,000 cars until 2015 Q1, and I'm looking at it right now. All of the VIN numbers look something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

[VIN with prefix of 5YJ](https://preview.redd.it/konjhkjzleq91.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7fd1e13c85087746af238f6bb489519dbfe9f8e)

None of these cars should have VIN prefixes that look like this, all of them should have a \*\*9- as the prefix of the cars. So because I was curious, I looked into whether or not NHTSA data was even available on these cars for 2013 (All have complaint number and dates, so we should be able to verify whether they even exist). The testing data was done by a company called KARCO, out in spain:

[https://nrd-static.nhtsa.dot.gov/reports/vehdb/v00000/v08300/v08308R001.pdf](https://nrd-static.nhtsa.dot.gov/reports/vehdb/v00000/v08300/v08308R001.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

The funny thing is, KARCO, to the best of my knowledge, was accredited in 2022.

622,1664224223,xouv0s,1,"What a way to start the week off! Lets set the scene here… 

The last time we had 5 red days in a row was July 8th to July 14th where SPY dropped from 390.64 to 371.04. The 6th day was a huge 1.91% green day. Before that was the June CPI/ FOMC drop where we put 5 red days in a row with a drop from 415.82 to 370.59. There was one green day (fomc) of 1.43% then we had 2 more red days down to 362.17. From there we saw a bigger pop of 3 of 4 days being green and going from 362.17 to 390.09. There has not been an instance of 6 red days in a row on SPY since Feb 2020. 

We have to ask ourselves are we in the same level of turmoil as Feb 2020? I would say no we are not. But we are clearly in a pretty bearish period of time in the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9t02og5dj9q91.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f32fa0e1647668cf9ebcc2fa89479db2e6f2ecf

Got a lot going on the daily chart but let me explain. I had mentioned the similarities for June 8th to June 17th on the SPY chart and this daily candle close today just made it even more similar. On June 16th we put in a candle of 370.94 to 364.08 followed be a 369.38 to 362.17 candle (that would be two back to back candles with a slightly lower high and a slightly lower low). Friday was 370.62 to 363.29 and today was 370.21 to 363.03… the exact same thing.

This to me could be a very large double bottom forming on SPY. Now only that but that June 17th low as I mentioned came after a 7 out of 8 red day stretch and SPY currently just put in its 8th red day out of the last 10 trading days. If spy is going to bounce its here… and if its not going to bounce the massive face melting dump is about to begin… Failure for SPY to make a new low for the year twice now sends a pretty big message especially with these large EOD intraday v bottoms we are seeing. Todays price action brought spy to the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel also. 

My anticipation here after 5 red days in a row is that we are going to see a large green day tomorrow and most likely will close over 370.6 resistance. From there I would anticipate a move back to 380-390 by end of week much like we saw at the June low.

There is a pretty enormous inverse head and shoulders forming on apple daily and weekly with a current support of 149.2. Apple and overall tech today held up much better then SPY. What I am seeing which is the same as last week is that this is not a NASDAQ driven sell off. I tend to be bullish on Apple as long as it holds 149.2.

Key support- 149.2 -&gt; 147.1

Quite a bit to unpack here on the Tesla daily. I mentioned last week I forsaw after the 312 rejection a possible head and shoulders forming with a target of 222-250 (blue arrows for visual). However, looking at the smaller red arrows we actually are forming a possible bullish 270.3 support bounce with a possible target of retesting that 312 level again. 

If tesla closes below 270.3 on the daily chart then I would look for the bigger sell off to play out. However, as long as we are holding support here at 270.3 there is a play on calls to 300-312.

Key support- 270.3 -&gt; 251.2

Key resistance- 283.7 -&gt; 291.6

The VIX was again on a pretty big mission today and saw a ton of intraday volatility. The one thing I am seeing here is that the VIX still has not broken that black dotted resistance line from the Jan 24 and May 2nd highs… Until that line is broken and until we see SPY break 362.17 (low of year) I am under the impression we hold support here. The VIX really has struggled to stay over 32 barely closing over it today. If the VIX breaks over 33.1 tomorrow and especially over 33.7 tomorrow I would be looking for a bigger sell off on SPY to take place. However, we may see the vix unwind and close back under 29.7 tomorrow which further points to a bigger green day tomorrow.

I am holding these calls. I had opened them at market open today. If my thesis holds true these will be itm tomorrow and green. I would like to close them tomorrow if possible but would consider holding till Wednesday if it looks like we are pushing. My first target for selling is the 373.44 gap fill (2.5% from close). If we make a new year low I will close these at a loss.

Overall pretty great day today despite the big morning reversal and high volatility. 

Remember when the VIX is over 30 (aka high volatility) we should be risk off here… we should be less greedy and should be careful of rogue moves up or down. Protect profits, preserve capital and live to trade another day.

2. **They put in the first inkling of bullish market structure** (they experienced significant bounces and are trying for a higher low)
3. **Their social activity is growing substantially** (people are showing interest in these stocks. They’re talking about them across social and news &amp; posts about them are trending)

Let's look at these 3 things in chart format:

**Tesla $TSLA:**

As you can see, these stocks have noticeably increased social activity that appears to be trending up in the last 2-3 months.

Now, what about stocks that have already revisited their bear market lows? Let’s take a look at a couple of popular stock picks that have performed poorly price-wise and spot the differences:

**NVIDIA $NVDA:**

[$NVDA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/l8dhcjzg9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e30185a23cb56a6e87bb09bd5d9675f45c6d52)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Adobe $ADBE:**

While $NVDA and $ADBE experienced recent spikes in social activity, they do not show the same kind of sustained growth in activity (continuous interest from people) as many of the better-performing stocks. 

Therefore, in times like these when the macro environment and markets are bearish, it’s probably best to keep your eye on stocks with sustainable increases in social activity, rather than the stocks with little growth or growth that fades quickly. 

So, will $TSLA, $AMZN, and $AAPL hold above their bear market lows? Or follow the rest of the market? 

While the social data presented in these charts don't provide the answers, they do provide a different perspective that's interesting to think about.

Lets take a look at the SPY daily. WE actually have a VERY interesting trend forming. Lets take a look back at June. Two days before CPI SPY was trading at 415.82. It then went into a two day sell off leading into CPI followed by another sell off leading into FOMC which was then followed up with two days of selling before the bottom was put in at 362.17. Total sell off of 13% with the bottom being a breakdown of the weekly 200ema but a closure over the 200ema on a Friday.

Now lets look at the present day SPY. We were trading at 411.73 one day before CPI that led into a CPI sell off into FOMC and we are now two days post FOMC and we just hit 363.29. That would be a total sell off of about 12%. We just broke through the weekly 200ema and rallied EOD to close over it. 

Looking at the daily candle we just put in a massively long hanging man candle and left a large almost $3 gap about to 373.44. We have clearly established ourselves in this downward channel and we have now broken into the red zone which is 351.21  to 370.7.

After SPY put in 4 red days in a row I would be a little surprised to see a 5th red day Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5n24xbribop91.png?width=714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e3597ab930f4152a7b90a76b3eca9010efc1ad

Now the weekly is quite interesting with what we saw happen today. We just broke the orange dotted support line which dates back to the 2020 covid crash recovery and is also precisely where the June low bounced. Now the one interesting thing is that we did bounce hard and managed with an impressive $5+ rally EOD to close back over the 200ema. This means we still haven’t closed below the weekly 200ema in over 2 years. The last time this happened was June and as you saw that was the bottom. Monday very well in my opinion could be green. The last time this happened in June spy opened 1.2% green.

Now when we look at supports and resistance here when it comes to supports some of these are going to be projections/ trajectories based off historic data and are more educated guesses since we have not spent time down here in a very long time. 

Key support next week- 366 -&gt; 358.6 -&gt; 354.7 -&gt; 339.9

Key resistance next week- 375.8 -&gt; 385.4

Futures daily put in a really nice base at 3660 today. That was a very hard bounce and 3660-3670 continues to be stout support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kuekkt7kbop91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ea3bdcbd9f5a8cb2082390f07961df876c8cb9

Having broken that weekly support again these supports will be projections based on historical price action. The biggest take away form the weekly is that we hard bounced off the 200ema and much like SPY refused to close below it once again. 

Key support- 3676 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3442 -&gt; 3415

Key resistance- 3825 -&gt; 3900

Interestingly enough Apple daily actually looks fairly bullish. While we did see 150.7 support break down and Apple did temporarily break through that 149.2 support it failed to break and make a new weekly low. Closing out a dragonfly doji on the downside here. I would too be looking for a relief rally much like we saw on September 19th.  

&amp;#x200B;

Apples weekly candle closed out with a gravestone doji with one heck of an impressive wick and closing below the candle body of the previous week. Generally a gravestone doji at the top of a run would signal downside much like we saw the week of August 15th, however, on a down trend as you can see during the April/ May sell off a gravestone on a downtrend can actually lead to bigger sell off. Apple did hold that 149.3 support EOD. 

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 145.7 -&gt; 142.7

Of all the charts I would say that Tesla is the bearish of them all. I called out on Wednesday that with that rejection of the 312 level and breaking the daily 8ema that I suspected Tesla to be the best short of them all. Turns out I was correct. We not only saw a bigger sell off we broke through support of that red bull channel. Tesla is one that held support and failed to fully breakdown compared to SPY and the rest of tech. 

As you can see by my blue arrows we are actually seeing a nice inverse head and shoulder forming with a price target of 222 to 252 in the next 2-3 weeks. I still think Tesla at this point will be a great short, though I expect an overall market bounce on Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla weekly broke through that bull channel support also and closed below the daily 8, 20, and 50ema. WE should look for a test of that 244 support in the next week or two with a potential for 222 in the next 3-4 weeks. 

Key support- 272 -&gt; 258 -&gt; 244.4 

Key resistance- 288 -&gt; 300.2

My anticipation still remains an overall bounce in the markets followed be most likely a sell off into Friday. Quarterly options expiration is on Friday. I do expect us to see a bigger rally come Friday and I do believe that is going to start the next leg up. However, as we saw yesterday with the massive rally EOD too there is a chance people took profits EOD today only to re-up their position for today. However, EOD today we did not see the same last second drop that we saw on Thursday which to me tells me people did not fully up re-up their positions. 

SPY has now dropped about 16% from the August 16th high. While there is obviously a bigger shift into a bearish sentiment I still am someone who believes we need to see continued catalysts to sell. Today was one of the first days where we had a true selloff (even tho a lot of that happened overnight and was erased EOD with that push) without a catalyst. 

Historically per CNBC next week is the worst week for markets, if that is true we could very well end up making a new 52week low. However, I will say failing to touch a new 52week low with -250 sell pressure (that’s super high as -5 to -10 is normal) does say a lot. This was clearly not capitulation and I am really not sure what will cause that and if we ever even get it.

We broke through that blue support line today which I fully expected as futures had broken their yesterday and Apple broke its last week. We could not for the life of us break through that 374.2 support line with 13 total bounces off of that level. However, we also could not break through 376.7 resistance either. 

Today truthfully was a very tight range day holding only $4.22 total movement for 55% of the average 10 day range of $7.63. 

My anticipation is that tomorrow we will see SPY test 370.7 support. If tomorrow closes red that would be our fourth red day in a row and I would be looking at a bounce into next week. However, IF we break up and back test 382.2 resistance then we could see the drill continue next week. 

My thoughts are this:

Test of 370 support tomorrow and we hold then we see 383 maybe 390 retested next week.   
 Test 370 and lose it then we are looking for a test of the weekly 200ema down at 368 and the 2020 covid support. IF we lose that AND close below it… then next week is going to be hella red. 

No test of 370 and we test 382.2 and reject then next week will be the time we take out 370.

No test of 370 and we break and close over 382.2 I like a green week next week. 

Key supports- 370.6 à 366.8 à 362.2

Key resistance- 376.7 à 382.2

Spy Weekly did break through the support of that black bear channel. I will look at the end of the week to find the new support. Key support is that orange dotted line which is the 2020 covid recovery support and also where the June low bounced… we we break below 368.5 there is a lot of pain ahead for the markets. The weekly 200ema has not been closed below since June 2020 and it is only 1.6% from close today…

&amp;#x200B;

Futures held the overnight low of 3763 and never broke it intraday. That was my known support. Markets will need to take out that support in order to see a bigger sell off. 

Key support- 3762 -&gt; 3671

Key resistance- 3805 -&gt; 3880

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cbjl1zs54ip91.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a976a1c3136b17aae4a9bad1b78316e09253e5c8

Interestingly enough futures weekly has not broken its black bear channel support yet. We should look for markets to take that support out now that we have seen SPY break its similar support. 

Key support is at the weekly 200ema of 3680 for tomorrow. Futures has not broken or closed below the weekly 200ema since April 2020. So you can see how big of a deal that would be… 

Overall for SPY and Futures IF we close below the weekly 200emas tomorrow then I would anticipate a pretty red week next week. That’s the type of milestone that the media is going to eat up and drive the bear narrative and capitulation narrative.

Looking at Apple… a little update I posted in my server… So I did some back testing on my success rate with Apple. While I honestly do pretty well with it and over the last month average about a 75% win rate with it I am averaging about an 86% win rate with SPX right now. For me I will be breaking up with Apple plays (at least day trades), however, I will continue to watch it and continue to look for some longer 14-30DTE plays if they present themselves. 

I mentioned this diamond pattern on Apple earlier this week and we finally today saw Apple break through it, however, it did not want to touch 150.8 support. The one thing though is that on that run back to the top Apple hard rejected 154.5 and the daily 8ema. This should be seen to me at least as a reconfirmation of the downside. 

I would like to see apple close below that red dotted line which is the 50% retracement of the bear channel for 2022. Once we close and hold below that I will be better believe in a bigger sell off coming. 

Key support- 152.4 -&gt; 150.8 -&gt; 149.3 

Key resistance- 154.5 

As long as apple closed below 154.5 and its daily 8ema tomorrow I would continue to hold a bearish bias for Spy and the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wt1jd4u64ip91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89a50598de5ba7b888853279e9ca74c9e9e332f0

Apple weekly is looking pretty bearish but I am worried about that hammer candle right now. That could send us into a double bottom and a green week next week. Ideal I would like to see apple close below 149.2 tomorrow which is its key support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p1oqxla74ip91.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09e0016386ba1416de591d0710efa58c1b44fd95

I called out that Tesla was looking like an amazing short being it rejected 312 again and it had broken its daily 8ema and its support line. Well turns out that was a pretty great call. I guess you can TA Tesla… haha

Tesla loss that key 292 support today and it even tried to retake it at one point but was unable to. However, it struggled to break through that daily 50ema at 285.8. Tesla will look to break that 50em and test the channel support at 281.3 tomorrow. If tesla breaks through that red support line I would be a big fan of another 14 to 30dte Put play on Tesla. 

Key support- 281.3 -&gt; 270.2

Key resistance- 292 -&gt; 299.8

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mu1tb4r74ip91.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18f484ff174501eaa15efa83d9b26c85ae414b74

Tesla weekly actually is holding currently right at its weekly 8ema at 288.5. Tesla hasn’t closed below that since August. A close below that I would be looking for the next support test at 272. As you can see that 270-272 range for Tesla is a big target. 

Key support- 288.5 -&gt; 278.3

Key resistance- 301.3

Tesla closes under 281 tomorrow and I would look for a short for next week, a close under 278 I would even expect a bigger drop down to 245 to 252. This is a play I am highly considering taking depending on how tomorrow plays out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty much done tracking the VIX at this point as it just seems to be detached from all reality and all of the market. I remember a time where we could reliably trust that the VIX and SPY would be connected and correlated. Not so much anymore. However the VIx closed in the same 26.9 to 28.4 range without really anything to show for it. Red day for spy and a red day for the VIX.

I took profits on the Tesla, Apple and SPY 15dte puts all before 1130 even hit. I played a few other small positions intraday but with another tight range day I found myself sitting cash. The technical today once again did not play well for me for entries. Actually I took a really solid technical looking play on some Apple puts around 1007am and got wrecked by an unexpected bounce only for it to drill the next candle. That was my first sign to get out and stay out of this market today. 

The funny thing about this market is that days like yesterday with FOMC even with those massive candles the technical actually played nicer with those candles then they did today. We are continuing to have big moves opening hour, last hour and the inbetween is left with tight ranged chop. 

As I was saying today and earlier this is giving me heavy flashbacks of June and July when we were stuck in violent chop, no trend and overall wrecked havoc on my portfolio. I am going to be treading lightly and at the first sign of struggle after 3 really solid weeks of trading now and getting back on a good path I will decrease size and happily sit cash when needed. 

Remember 2022 and probably 2023 is about capital preservation for the next bull market. Sure there is 100% money to be made in this 2022/23 bear market but look around you… a lot of people are getting wrecked right now and capitulating out of trading for good… some of those are even well established traders. We have everything to lose and nothing to gain right now. Unless you are trading for your livelihood right now there is nothing wrong with decreasing sizes, decreasing profit targets and tightening up stoplosses. 

**Tomorrows game plan:**

\-Watch overnight and of course opening hour. If we break 374.2 I expect us to go down and retest support at 370.7. If we break through 370.7 I will be eyeing the 2020 covid support line at 368.4. If we break through that support and most importantly IF the daily candle tomorrow CLOSES below the weekly 200ema of 367.6 I will look to open some 7dte or 14dte puts on SPY. Next Friday is SPY quarterly expiration. I wouldn’t be surprised to see us dump into that and then when JPM rotates we rally. 

\-On Tesla if it breaks through that 281 support and especially if it breaks through 278 support tomorrow I will look for some 14DTE puts with a take profits target of 245-252. 

\-As much as I think Apple will see the 120s-130s in the next few months I don’t see a good signal for me to want to short it. 

OKAY here is a little offtopic… non-ta based slight conspiracy theory thought that crossed my mind…

Next week friday is the quarterly JPM morgan collar rotation... they had bought 4000 calls and sold 3580 and 3000 puts if i recall correctly... We magically hit 430 and rejected and now that we are headed next week into friday quartely expiration look where we are... 

What if, and this is totally a non-TA but psyops conspiracy theory based guess, we do break the weekly 200ema and we drill through 3580 and end up somewhere between 3000 and 3580 by friday. Then we see them rotate the collar and we start the bull rally...

Hear me out here... March 31st quarterly expiration was nearly the top of the big drop from 462 to 362. The June 30th quarterly was nearly the bottom before we rallied from 371 to 431. 

What if we are about to put in the next bottom before we go on another quarterly rally till December 30th when the next quarterly expires... It would line up pretty close with the cycle analysis and would make sense having no fomc till November, the usual santa rally and rallying for midterms....  
 

And for those of you who forgot how violent these days are… SPY rallied $8 in about 2.5 hours last JPM only to sell off EOD. The quarterly for March saw a $7 drop in about 45minutes and a total intraday drop of almost $8.5. Next week will definitely be interesting.

Disclaimer: We have a long position in Fisker Inc; this post is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice

Keeping it short (and sweet) - feel free to ping questions below, happy to elaborate.

**Company Background**

Pure-play BEV OEM with start of production set for 17th November 2022 - they are asset-light (they don't own warehouses nor production sites), and the company is headed by Henrik Fisker (better known as the designer behind the Aston Martin DB9, DB8 Vantage, and the BMW Z8).

**Thesis**

1- Best-in-class price point - Fisker's first model (the Ocean) is an all-electric SUV, not too dissimilar to the Tesla Model Y, priced at an extraordinary $30,000

2- Robust demand until 2024 - \~60k reservations (deposits paid) for the Fisker Ocean means supply is likely met until end of 2023, creating a highly visible sales/earnings stream that will help fund future vehicle roll-outs

3- Exciting roadmap - with two known projects in the pipeline (P.E.A.R, a small 'smart-mobility' vehicle, of which are very popular in China - and RONIN, a high-end sports vehicle with a price point \~$100k), Fisker are not only strategically expanding their addressable market, but they are also diversifying from the hyper-popular BEV SUV market that is very 'in' now but is likely to be flooded with supply in the next 2-3 years.

**Valuation**

Lowest NTM EV/Sales of closest peers by a significant margin, most likely due to liquidity concerns that we think are overbaked. If Fisker were to trade in-line with peers, we would need to see the share price 3x, putting our PT around $20.

**Risks**

Liquidity - there are concerns around whether Fisker may need a future equity raise - we think the $850m in cash currently on the balance sheet will be enough to finance the Ocean rollout, and see potential for proceeds here to support the P.E.A.R rollout in late 23.

Supply chain - dominant across most OEMs but exacerbated by Fisker's entirely outsourced Bill-of-Materials.

The expected wait times has shortened which could indicate a bear case and a bull case… the Bear case is that there is a crazy amount of cancellations which have been the result of closing showrooms in China. The bull case is that production in the giga factories have been getting better and they are delivering cars at a much more comfortable pace. Then earnings, expected 10/18-10/24 (not official). Not sure if the currency changes will be such a big factor to the downside…. But perhaps deliveries will aid that.

I wont lie though they definitely flipped the script a little bit on us here! I did not anticipate a $7 drop at 2pm into 230pm. However, that 215 to 230pm gave us a good hint to the upside that was to come. I was anticipating a 235pm rip however that rip came a little early started at 231pm and I did miss quite a bit of profit there. I stuck to my plan of entering at 234pm… saw a nice 30%... dropped to -30% and then it ripped back up to 20%... got a kinda shit fill at 16.7%. I was happy to exit profitable as it did appear we were not going to see the normal green ripper, however, seconds later I woulda been looking at 75-100% profits instead of only 16.7%. Thanks to my position size though this was still a nice win for me so im happy overall. But I once again didn’t trust myself to play the plan out… or did I just not succumb to greed?

I do expect a red open tomorrow… how red? I am not sure honestly but historically says -1.28% is the average red open. We just closed the reddest FOMC year to date and I think it shows a lot about the market…. Gonna be an interesting rest of the week that’s for sure.

The biggest bearish undertone that we should take away from today is the failure of spy to even retest 390 completely. With todays realistically known 75bps hike and expected hawkish JPOW we should have closed over 390… we are seeing the true weakness of the markets here… The most bullish things markets have going for them is next FOMC is in November and next CPI is still 3 weeks away. 

Spy daily just put in a big huge engulfing, daily 8ema, and falling just short of key 390 resistance daily candle. This looks pretty bearish to me. Overall we broke below 378.8 and gap filled (finally) the July 14th 378.57 gap. That only leaves the June 17th 369.38 gap which is a measily 2.2% away from close… And that is my target for tomorrow.

Spy is still maintaining both the black and blue bear channels and is now trending back below the 50% bear channel retracement. My target tomorrow is a test at that 370 support level on the daily. 

Key support- 375 -&gt; 373.5 (blue support) -&gt; 370.7 (major daily support) -&gt; 366.75

SPY weekly is going for its bear channel support test at 375. If we break this support it will open up a bigger downside. The biggest place I suspect us to bounce if we truly sell off is that weekly 200ema at 368.

Futures weekly is trending just above its key weekly support line of 3790. This will be a key support to watch both overnight and tomorrow.

Apple chart actually is giving me some pretty big September  12th / 13th dead cat bounce vibes. I mentioned this in my youtube video but we are currently seeing one of my favorite patterns playing out on apple right now. It’s the diamond pattern. Its very similar to a breakout/ down symmetrical triangle but the general principle is that when support or resistance of this diamond breaks the move is explosive. 

Apple closed below its daily 200ema and daily 8ema again. This is a pretty bearish overall movement for Apple. It failed to reach resistance of that blue bear channel and failed to completely bearishly engulf. 

I am looking for a break down closed to 150 on Apple and a test of that red support line. If that red support line is to break this week we should be targeting 130s to low 140s. 

Key support- 152.3 -&gt; 151.6 (red support) -&gt; 150.7

On Apples weekly I really would have liked to see a retest of that black resistance at 161 but it looks like we may go for that support test at 145.7 (-5.3% from close)

By popular demand… I will now be including Tesla in my TA and I actually will consider some plays on Tesla in the future once I continue to watch it and see how it actually obeys supports/ resistance. I will only trade it myself IF it actually trades realistically and rationally. 

We are looking at a pretty significant red bull channel on Tesla that dates back to the June lows. Tesla really hasn’t seen the big sell off that SPY, Apple and the rest of the tech has seen. 

We just watched Key resistance at 312 reject for the 6th time in less than 2 months. I would not be long on calls until that resistance is broken and closed over. I am seeing a breakdown of the blue support line that started back on the September 6th support line bounce. With his breaking and closing below its daily 8ema I see weakness with a target of 292 followed by 270.

Key 301 resistance is still holding on Tesla. With this being the 7th week in the last 9 weeks to reject at this 301 level. Key support 278.6 and key resistance 326.8.

Wow now that’s a doji candle if I have ever seen one! The VIX had an impressive range of $4.63 or 18% from low of day to high of day. A few really interesting things about the VIX here… Throughout the day it actually began to unwind from its high around 28 before FOMC. We saw FOMC hit and it instantly hit 30 before it started its unwind. The VIX seemed very confused to say the least today. Overall tho the VIX closed a massive doji and it broke through that black resistance line of this downward channel. 

You can see the next resistance is that blue downward channel that is the top of May 2nd, June 13th, and June 16th. If we see this blue resistance line broken on the VIX I do suspect we are going to see vix touch high 30s if not 40s and SPY could put a new bottom in. This is a tough place to be because the VIX used to be a very good guide for what SPY was going to do…. We have been so detached from reality since June honestly the VIX is very hard to trust or gauge a trade off. Best VIX play would be wait for the 40s+ and short it. 

10% challenge-

Honestly today played out almost exactly how I expected… I expected a green open (played calls for a nice 35.6% gain and sold immediately at open). I suspected based off historical trends that we would see SPY put the top of the range pre-FOMC in around 10-1030. I did attempt a small put in the morning and barely got out with a 3.5% gain as premiums were not moving. I just waited it out until FOMC. 

I was looking for that 235pm bounce and despite a massive $7 sell off I was still committed to my plan. My only regrets of the day is 1. I was too rigid in waiting till 234pm and I should have entered at 231pm when I saw the bounce happening early. And 2. I sold at 16.7 % (bad fill) when my position went from green to red to green. I sold about 10 seconds before it did the expected rip of another $4. MY goal was to sell before 245pm and I sold around 242pm. I should have waited an extra 2-3 minutes. However, with the massive $12 drop EOD from the high at 245pm in retrospect I am glad I sold when I did. It was still a great play overall. 

I did call out overnight puts based on the historical trend and clear bearish sentiment of the markets. I waited regrettably way too long to get into that put. I expected a small bounce EOD there back over 382. But I entered a 375 2dte put and I ended up selling it right before EOD.

[More](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/fisker-hits-a-major-milestone-on-road-to-affordable-evs-for-all?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO) [good PR](https://fiskerati.com/fsr/fisker-shares-outperform-this-week-as-the-machine-has-started/) and [unrelated news items](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/16/final-trades-mo-tlt-fsr.html) are also beginning to take note of the long-time EV underdog as the rumor mill gets started ahead of production.

[Most analysts have FSR as a ""buy"" or ""hold""](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fsr/analyst-research), with near term price targets ranging from $10-$15, going as high as $20. FSR also beat its most recent earnings.

Noting that [short interest is currently &gt; 28%](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest), at 45,642,188 shares, with FSR being the 27th most shorted security on the list. In the previous 52 week period, Fisker has traded as high as $23.75 and more recently as low as $7.95. $FSR is currently trading right around $9.00.

For those who haven't been watching, *FSR is sitting on cash as it goes into production in November*, currently about 60 days out. The company has approaching 60,000 confirmed reservations, a modest but loyal cult following, a somewhat-polarizing CEO with an established name in the industry, and is outsourcing production to [Magna Steyr](https://www.magna.com/company/company-information/magna-groups/magna-steyr) (who are an established vehicle manufacturing leader, and also produce vehicles for BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar, etc). Although the initial Fisker vehicles likely won't qualify for US tax incentives, demand remains strong both in the US and European markets, and long term plans include US production of future models.

Personally, near term I am expecting FSR to rise a bit on rumors as we approach production in November, after which the initial reception of the vehicles will probably predict the price action going forward. **My current positions** are 225 calls and 60 calendar spreads targeting a near term (@60dte) price action in the $11-$14 range, with leaps for 2024 starting at $15. This is not quite a YOLO for me, but it is a significant bet, and I actually believe in the stated outcomes.

FSR is probably not a Tesla killer and may not survive the rapidly changing EV market going forward, and I'm not here to say that it is, Fisker needs to prove that on its own.

My argument is simply that, *at this time*, this is a [real company](https://www.fiskerinc.com/), sitting on cash, with real customers, [good PR](https://fiskerati.com/) creating actual demand, respected manufacturing business partners, trading near its all time low, a couple of months before the long-awaited deliveries begin. I believe there is short term upside potential on the growing rumor/news cycle, and if the cars are well received, it *could* be a long term player with a novel business model for the industry.

Biden has already set the theme for the 2020s and it's important to get in early. It is a developer of technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water.

**Background**

This source of water includes salt and wastewater. It is creating low-cost nanoparticles that mimic photosynthesis to efficiently use sunlight to separate the hydrogen from the water. This is further enabling them to expand the world of renewable energy by distributing hydrogen production for renewable energy and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Although I am a huge fan of Tesla, many of their competitors use hydrogen fuel cells and/or have a high possibility of implementing the technology. The company is based in university (which is where many great things originate) and has received multiple funding agreements, further leading to their first prototype being unveiled last week.

**Management and Financials**

The Company’s investment strategy will be led by Chief Operating Officer Woosuk Kim, who formerly served as Senior Vice President and Head of the M&amp;A Group at Seoul-based SK Innovation. Mr. Kim has executed over $4 billion in mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures throughout his career. ***Currently trading at a $153 million market valuation*** It has 4.2 billion out of 10 billion authorized shares outstanding. The Company is well funded moving forward with $52 million in the treasury and $7.4 million in marketable securities on $39.5 million in liabilities and the Company is pre revenue. It is an exciting story developing in small caps addressing a booming hydrogen generation market size which *was USD 142.33 billion in 2019* and ***is projected to reach USD 208.86 billion by 2027 and a trillion by 2050.*** The global hydrogen market is large and growing rapidly. Over 110 countries have set goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and as governments look to clean energy sources to help them meet their targets, hydrogen is emerging as a promising solution. It is estimated that nearly 25% of global energy will come from clean hydrogen alone by 2050 a tenfold increase from today, which could bring in a projected $2.5 trillion in annual revenues. Their Net income is **up 127% YoY**. SunHydrogen reports a financial position of $52 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 a number that instills confidence in its executive and scientific teams alike as the Company continues moving toward the commercialization of its nanoparticle-based green hydrogen technology.

**\*Info From an Important Person\***

The company is poised to capitalize on recently passed tax credits. I will break it down:

\-- 10 year production credit based on greenhouse gas emissions rate (cannot exceed 4kg of CO2e per kg of hydrogen)

\-- Has to be produced by the taxpayer for sale or use in taxpayer's business

\-- Facility must be placed in service after 2022 and begin construction before 2033

\-- W&amp;A bonus applies - which can result in credits up to 3$/kg

\-- Can upgrade old facilities to make them produce qualified hydrogen and treat as newly placed in service

\--Can take ITC in lieu of hydrogen PTC - credit rates of 1.2 - 6% depending on emission rates. 

**Prototype Unveiled**

Last week, They revealed their first prototype. Small, efficient, and bound for greatness. Within an individual SunHydrogen panel, billions of microscopic nanoparticles are splitting apart water at the molecular level to produce hydrogen and oxygen. SunHydrogen’s nanoparticle technology directly uses the electrical charges created by sunlight to generate hydrogen when the Sun is shining. However, when the Sun is not shining, this prototype is also able to power the catalyst and membrane integration assembly using renewable grid electricity from wind or hydropower sources.

**Thoughts**

*CREATING HYDROGEN FROM SUNLIGHT AND WATER IS A NO-BRAINER, right???* Unlike hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces pure water as the only byproduct. With Biden and future administrations pushing (or being pushed) for sustainable energy, It is in a great position to become a breakthrough energy company.

**TLDR:** 

**H.Y.S.R is cheap as shit and destined to be a winner if you are interested in INVESTING in the OBVIOUS future of energy. Given the benefits to EVs and the sustainable energy world as a whole, I do not think this company is going anywhere. Although we only have a prototype so far, if their technology is as good as they say it is, this stock will become one of the most well-known by 2030. Also, that very important person (my wife's boyfriend) dabbles in the field, and happened to sit with a law firm and discussed their technology. (not really;) Seriously. Invest in this shit.**

It is time. Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I’m thinking about a few things:

Presidential cycles: 

(formatted weird due to some rules)

For like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.

Tesla’s trend:

Absolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I’m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.

NOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:

It really isn’t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon’s commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it’s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don’t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I’d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.

Elon Musk:

You gotta love him. He’s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he’s an absolute savage. I’m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he’s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.

TLDR: Why the fuck haven’t we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you don’t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife’s boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS in 2 years?

Key support tomorrow will remain at 393 -&gt; 391 -&gt; 390.4 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 386.4. 

Key resistance tomorrow will remain at 395.4 -&gt; 397.8 -&gt; 400.5 à 401.9.

With this consolidation day not much has changed daily and weekly level wise. We still hold key support at 390 for the weekly and key resistance at 412.

Often times I look to ES futures for any hints of what might be to come on SPY, however, the charts are fairly mirror images with no new data to trade off of.

Key support- 3956 -&gt; 3930 -&gt; 3910 -&gt; 3868

Key resistance- 3980 -&gt; 4005 -&gt; 4030

Key weekly resistance remains at 4160 and key support at 3900.

Apple yet again today spent time trading under and over its daily 200ema now closing its 2nd day in a row below the daily 200ema. This is the first time there has been back to back candles closed below the daily 200ema since May. 

Major support is being established at this 153.8 to 154.5 level and major resistance is starting to form at 157.4. Today I did play a few plays based off the bounces here on support and resistance. Apple actually was a much better trade most of the day then SPY was. I was tempted to dabble in some tesla plays today too but withheld the temptation.

The VIX did a whole lot of nothing today seeing a mild decline and closing back below that key 26.9 level. The VIX is not going to work its way back down to test 25.5.. a break and closure below 25.5 would signal a potential bottom. 

For me while the VIX really has been disconnected from reality… I would not be positioning myself too long or too aggressively short until the VIX breaks and closes of 28. I also struggle going long on calls while VIX is over 25.5.

So something to keep in mind that is happening this Friday is that it is Quad witching day. Ironically the last quad witching day on June 17th was the bottom and the low of the year so far. While the day itself was uneventful and pretty much just chopped all day and ranged it did put in a bottom and cause one heck of an impressive rally. 

If we look at March 18th quad witching day that also happens to coincide with a pretty impressive rally. Is it possible that Friday will be the “bottom” and we see a rally develop? 

If we think about it while the markets yesterday realized how screwed we are long term the fact that we did not dump today says a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly enough last night and at open today there was a 30-33% chance of a 100bps hike at the meeting on Sept 21st. However, you can see that the % chance has already declined to 25%. 

There is potential markets hella over-reacted thinking we get a 100bps hike, we consolidate in this 390-405 range until FOMC and when we do get the 75bps hike markets see a bit of a relief rally. There is no FOMC until November so there would be no more fear in the markets and the fear of a 100bps at next meeting wouldn’t really be a factor until next months CPI. 

Remember it is 100x harder for markets to sell off like yesterday and 100x more natural for market to trend up then down. Markets NEED a reason to sell… the question now is what is the reason… And what is that potential next catalyst you may ask? 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently there is a railroad strike that tomorrow would be the last day to “settle” it before Fridays cooling off strike period ends and we may see a world of hurt start. 

I feel like a lot of people fail to realize just how much cargo and liquids are transported by rail still in our country. This strike could potentially cause inflation and supply chain issues to get even worse than they already are. The markets very much so could negatively react to this. There were some sell offs today on news but so far the algos haven’t hooked up on much yet. 

10% challenge-

I had a really great day trading. I actually did the first 4 trades within the first hour of the markets opening which is not common for me. But lately the first hour has been really nice movements and technical and then the rest of the day much like today was just choppy trash not worth trading. 

I also played a few Apple options todays too. Apple as I mentioned above actually has been looking much smoother and better to trade then SPY has lately. I will look to continue to capitalize on Apple. 

Good day for me today hope you guys had a good day too.

Lomiko utilized the funds raised early in the year, including $2.1m in flow-through financing and a $1.5m private placement, to progress work in drilling, metallurgical testing and environmental baseline studies. In addition, geophysical field work for the six new graphite properties is now complete and has identified new targets for future follow-ups. Lomiko has also completed its summer soil and surface field testing program with Critical Elements Lithium Corp. and Gold Spot AI at its Bourier lithium property. These results will be shared when they are available. The Company is actively working to build a pipeline of projects suitable to feed into the critical minerals supply chain and power a transition from fossil fuels to renewables, especially for EV battery systems.

They did get hit with allegations of fraudulent scientific data and results or something, but it might of been disproven? Not sure

Anyways plays are 
7 Oct 22, 40 strike
Feb 23, 55 strike

Something weird with this stock, it made a run last week, but for some reason my options wouldn't update in pricing, felt like there was low liquidity or no market maker for this stock , hoping someone could look into that


Lastly I got to include this play - GME

No need to reiterate all the DD, you all know it, if not it's on super S, lots of announcements recently. Can it be considered a cult stock? Sure. But tesla was considered cultish at one point too and see where it is now.

Electric car giant Tesla is evaluating the feasibility of a lithium hydroxide refining facility on the gulf coast of Texas.

Tesla said the plant would be focused on the development of “battery-grade lithium hydroxide” and be “the first of its kind in North America,” according to a newly released letter to the Texas Comptroller’s Office.

The company would process “raw ore material into a usable state for battery production” then ship the lithium hydroxide to various Tesla battery manufacturing factories, the application said.

In April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company may need to get into lithium refining because the cost of the metal had “gone to insane levels.”

The price of lithium is up 120% this year, according to an tracking index from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

685,1662565929,x88ncu,1,"Apple is widely expected to give a first look at its latest iPhone lineup on Wednesday, as the tech giant has done every year in September for about a decade.

The latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It’s rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model – meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.

Finally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company’s flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.

It’s not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday’s event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.

Apple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple’s bigger breakout successes in recent years.

Apple’s event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: “Far out.” 

This has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.

While the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.

Many analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.

Apple’s stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.

But with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales — and all the subscription revenue that comes with that — be enough to turn Apple’s stock from red to green?

Investors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. 

Analysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.

The company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.

One analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That's because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.
Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple's initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with ""macro storm clouds building."" So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.
""This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years,"" Ives added.
Apple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.
According to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

What's more important is the live grenade that is the stock price. Our system has become so financialized, companies and executives using stock valuations as collateral to finance their lives, fundamentals no longer matter. We saw what happened with HKTD. Cramer wasn't whining about their profitability, was he?

BBBY is about whether or not we can keep pushing the share price up and bleed the shorts out just like Tesla did. Brick by brick. I don't think Cohen is a dummy. GME/BBBY really aren't about the products/services, they're just about keeping the company and share price alive and as high as possible.

We saw what happened with those zombie stocks that were all but dead, trading at .00001. All of a sudden, a 10,000% gain one day.

Cohen and his big money backers found the short meme basket, started turning those companies around and came up with a plan to squeeze the shorts' nuts. At least, that's what I'd do.

699,1662129176,x431dv,1,"Cracks are beginning to form in the resiliency of Ark Invest's retail-driven shareholder base, as its flagship fund suffers its biggest outflow in nearly a year.

The Ark Invest Disruptive Innovation ETF saw outflows of $820 million in August, just shy of its September 2021 outflow of $939 million, according to data from VettaFi.

The about-face could mark the beginning of a reversal of a more than year-long trend in which Ark saw positive inflows from its investors despite flagging performance. Year-to-date, the flagship ETF has seen about $1 billion in inflows.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has chalked up the resiliency of her investor base to Ark's practice of being transparent with its investment research and long-term views.

""Ark is net inflowing this year, and I think it's because we give away our research, and our research is unique. It's original research. And we're trying to help people understand how the world is going to change during the next five to 10 years, and how rapidly it's going to change,"" she said in a video update earlier this year.

But now investors may be growing tired of the consistent underperformance in the once-hot thematic ETF. Since its peak in February 2021, Ark's flagship fund has lost 75%, as a series of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and elevated inflation concerns put a big dent in longer-duration stocks that are not yet profitable.

Ark's flagship fund has lost 56% year-to-date, more than double the Nasdaq 100's decline of 25% over the same time period. Of the 36 holdings in Ark's flagship ETF, only two have generated a positive return over the past year: Tesla and Signify Health, according to data.

Meanwhile, a handful of stocks in Ark's portfolio are down upwards of 90% over the past year, including Berkeley Lights and Invitae Corporation, and Ark isn't afraid of buying the dip in its losing stocks.

Adding to Ark's underperformance has been its steadfast commitment to increasing its exposure to fledging tech stocks that saw a boom during the peak work-from-home era, with Zoom Video and Roku being its two largest holdings. Meanwhile, the fund has been building sizable positions in unproven biotech firms Ginkgo Bioworks and Beam Therapeutics, among others.

But despite the recent outflows and poor performance, Ark Invest still commands a sizable investment base relative to other thematic ETF providers. Ark's flagship fund has $8 billion in assets under management, a considerable amount despite its sizable fall from a peak of about $28 billion in early 2021.

- GME is not going to buy BBBY, there is absolutely 0% synergies and both BBBY and GME would go down faster than your mom does on me
- BBBY is not going to sell its baby business for more money than it’s worth right now. At best you could add a 10-25% premium. The baby business is a portion of BBBY, and it’s also a growth prospect
- Selling a growth prospect reduces stock price bc the company is eliminating an opportunity to generate cash
- imagine they sell, what will they do with the money? I’ll tell you, nothing at all other than circle jerk. Selling baby business be a negative outcome 
- daddy Cohen left already, so get over it, he’s not coming back, and he took all your money already, multiple times 


So how do you make money?

Buy puts if you have balls. According to my calculations we’ll be back at 6-7 dollars in no time. 10 to be safe.

**Disclaimer :** 

Apologies beforehand if you are looking for lambo profits and tl;dr  coz folks this stuff is just not for you guys. This is just all theoretical stuff that you need to know about investing or trading in this ""High inflationary"" decade.

**Respected Traders and Investors,**

&amp;#x200B;

It's a humble request from me to you guys that you please read my and the three papers mentioned below ( not by me but by the most respected people in economics ) before entering the ""Bearish September"" and making any  decision about investing or trading. Things are about to change so much. The sole reason being is ""Oil"". ( This is also why sir Warren Buffet is buying oil stocks  )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Research Paper 1 ( This is not a research paper. It's just my  theory. So you can skip this ) 

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Oil Futures (They have gone from extreme backwardation to Contango. We talked about this)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Widow maker Winter contracts : WTI Oil and Crude Oil \( December - January Futures\)](https://preview.redd.it/yms6ycizetk91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c08e7048e86e5bba8377d8a5041ca409d0a1e91c)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Spr is about to have record amount of low Oil in 40 yrs by October. ( Close to 70's Oil shocks )**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mbn5p6cohtk91.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5f4dd38b234558415cfa2b981b9e6031e48f58c

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Opec+ will decrease the supply of Oil due to market volatility in futures contract which is kinda funny if you have taste for dark humor.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ik06osc4itk91.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9819c4b96f03e01a91ddd9c849db6491be3772a0

 [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/oil-increases-more-than-5-in-week-ending-august-26/2670133](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/oil-increases-more-than-5-in-week-ending-august-26/2670133) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result : Supply shock is coming by Q4 end.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Invalidation : Demand goes horribly down i.e. ""Worst Recession by Q4"" itself will lead to Oil prices falling.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So if anyone over here is questioning about  Warren Buffet and  his judgement in picking stocks well for those people i would like to say is read the graph below. Look he beat the stock market in first half of 70's stagflation and he is the only proven guy you should listen to in these markets dynamics.  There is no one other than him alive in investing world who understand a proper ""Stagflation"" and how to invest in these times. Literally no one. ( Proper stagflation = High Inflation + High Unemployment + Stagnant Growth )

&amp;#x200B;

[No one came close to him in first half of 70's Stagflation.](https://preview.redd.it/9l2z6jauftk91.png?width=1733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d9b206d3dec69b9638f4dcebb57e708f7943d24)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Now why should you be scared of Oil shocks ?**

&amp;#x200B;

Most of you GenZ might be thinking well Oil goes to $150 so what. ""I am loaded with cash"" or ""Who buys Oil. That is so uncool. I just drive my Tesla around"" or ""I take only metros for work""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Inflation expectation :*

Well dudes not we but for companies all across the globe ""Oil is input cost to everything"". So what happens is when Oil goes up, the long term expectation of inflation starts to change. They might become anchored as companies might look to pass these cost to consumers. And then you get even a higher CPI print than July CPI 9.1%. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Even IMF is scared of rising inflation again](https://preview.redd.it/u0e85zjvjtk91.png?width=1413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15ca23e8d17cd5fa6d5157d509a235cc04d13465)

 [https://blogs.imf.org/2022/08/01/soaring-inflation-puts-central-banks-on-a-difficult-journey/](https://blogs.imf.org/2022/08/01/soaring-inflation-puts-central-banks-on-a-difficult-journey/) 

&amp;#x200B;

*Bond yields :*

So Inflation exp unanchored leads to ""Bond Yields rising above 3.5% in both 2yr and 10yr and then going to 4%"". This will in turn cause stocks sell off. No no no no. You're gonna get capitulation like 2008 crash. Banks or hedge funds may blow up somewhere. Fire sale happens everywhere. Businesses and people may default on their payments causing mayhem everywhere if those 10yr yields starts trading above 4%.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*How Stocks might collapse :* 

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's understand two scenario.

S1 :

Suppose i have a billion dollars. 

I have US stocks but in order to hedge myself from downside risk i short Dxy index i.e shorting dollars in a sense. So when Us bond yields rise then Dxy jumps up and boi oh boi it will jump past 110. So in order to protect myself  i will have to sell Us stocks.

S2 :

Now the similar thing happens with US Treasuries bought by foreign countries. Suppose i am a country with trillion dollars 

And i see Dxy going past 110 then my currency will depreciate against dollar. So if i have a dollar denominated debt which most of the country do then i have to sell Us treasury in order to finance for the increase in my payment for debt coz my country currency depreciated a/g dollars. This is what then leads to Sovereign Debt crisis. Countries might default if they failed to make payment i.e. have less Us treasury bonds. And then they have to hyper-inflate their currency in order to pay debt.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Goldman Sachs has already issued warning that they will sell $147B dollars if the stocks sell off. So good luck holding their bags if you can.

&amp;#x200B;

**End result : Oil shocks -&gt; Unanchored inflation exp -&gt; Bond yields rise -&gt; Dxy up -&gt; Stock sell off**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Research Paper 2  : ( This is not a Research paper. It's Zoltan Pozsar Newsletter )

[https://plus2.credit-suisse.com/shorturlpdf.html?v=5amR-YP34-V&amp;t=-1e4y7st99l5d0a0be21hgr5ht](https://plus2.credit-suisse.com/shorturlpdf.html?v=5amR-YP34-V&amp;t=-1e4y7st99l5d0a0be21hgr5ht)

  
For those who don't know about Zoltan Pozsar well what ""Warren Buffet"" is to you guys in Stock market that is exactly what ""Zoltan Pozsar"" is to people who trade in bond market. He is the ""Oracle of Repo market"" and is the Global head of short term interest rate strategist in Credit Suisse America. When he speaks you just listen. 

His works this year has been about ""Bretton Woods 3"" , ""Bank reserves"" and his last newsletter was about ""War and inflation"". Do check them out too after finishing these paper first.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Research Paper 3  : ( This is a Research Paper presented in Jackson Hole by Francesco Bianchi and Leonardo Melosi )

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Inflation as a Fiscal Limit [https://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9037/JH\_Paper\_Bianchi.pdf](https://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9037/JH_Paper_Bianchi.pdf)  

&amp;#x200B;

This research paper has been circulated heavily in media recently by Bloomberg, Business, Yahoo Finance and now Cnbc. What the researchers of this paper are trying to say is this inflation is mostly due to fiscal policy rather than monetary policy. And also if Fed doesn't get help from government like Volcker did under President carter well then the rising interest rate will increase inflation rather than decrease inflation which is kinda crazy if you think about it. So just read the paper if this made you curious. It's truly mind-boggling. ( Skip the calculations part )

&amp;#x200B;

# 

# Research Paper 4  :

&amp;#x200B;

Why Central bank sheet is a such an uphill task [https://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9040/JH\_Paper\_Acharya.pdf](https://www.kansascityfed.org/Jackson%20Hole/documents/9040/JH_Paper_Acharya.pdf) 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this final paper is my most favorite one as it focuses on the risk of decreasing balance sheet by the Federal Reserve. So we all know that Nyc Fed has projected that balance sheet held by Fed will go from 9T in 2022 to 6T by 2025 and then 9T again by 2029.

So this paper focuses on that aspect that how difficult the process might be. Hence one of ex Fed member who was in last QT ie. Joseph Wang and other economists are arguing that something might blow up before Fed starts to decrease balance sheet by -3T in three years. Just think about it if markets really are forward looking can they price this balance sheet removal. So i too agree that it's not that easy as it may look like unlike Jeff Snyder who thinks its so easy.

You see i am quite sad from last night where i wrote this fine newsletter for you guys in order to bring season 2 of ""Wall Street Newsletter"" back. Well folks i forgot to save it and now its gone.

728,1661521002,wy9fps,1,"Elon Musk's demands for Twitter Inc user details were rejected as ""absurdly broad"" by a judge on Thursday, although the billionaire will get some data as he pursues his bid to end his $44 billion acquisition of the company.

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery said many of Musk's data demands were ""absurdly broad,"" amounting to trillions of data points that ""no one in their right mind has ever tried to undertake such an effort.""

The judge said Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc, has had data and documents needed to pursue his case, much of which was provided before he said on July 8 he was terminating the deal in part because Twitter was withholding information.

""My overall impression is that plaintiff has agreed to produce a tremendous amount of information to defendants, and that the information plaintiff has agreed to produce is sufficiently broad to satisfy most of plaintiff's obligations,"" wrote Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery.

Twitter was ordered to turn over data from 9,000 accounts sampled in a fourth-quarter audit to estimate the number of spam or bot users on the social media platform.

Twitter had said that data no longer existed and it would be burdensome to recreate it, although McCormick gave the company two weeks to produce it.

""We look forward to reviewing the data Twitter has been hiding for many months,"" said Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, in an emailed statement.

Twitter declined to comment.

Musk, the world's richest person, has said he wants to test that audit's accuracy because he believes the company fraudulently misrepresented that only 5% of its accounts were spam. He wants McCormick to rule he can walk away from the deal.

Twitter wants McCormick to order Musk to close the deal at the agreed price of $54.20 per share. The shares briefly rose about 1% after the ruling and ended up 0.6% at $41.05.

Hate it or love it, that thing rips. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I’m thinking about a few things:

Presidential cycles:

For like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.

Tesla’s trend:

Absolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I’m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.

NOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:

It really isn’t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon’s commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it’s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don’t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I’d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.

Elon Musk:

You gotta love him. He’s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he’s an absolute savage. I’m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he’s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.

TLDR: Why the fuck haven’t we rallied around Elon when he has supported us when we needed him the most? If you don’t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife’s boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS by the end of the year?

736,1661453094,wxm27h,1," The outlook for $CMG appears to be bright. In fact, over the past several years, the estimates for the current- and following-year revenue have consistently risen with the small exception of the beginning of the covid outbreak.  Today $CMG is trading at about $1,650.00 per share, a cost that's far out of reach of many an average investor interested in buying a piece of the fast-food market. There are also its restaurant employees, who might want to invest as well but don't have a few grand to drop to do so. (They could, of course, buy fractional shares at many brokerages if they wanted to).  

Chipotle reported disappointing sales this quarter as price hikes helped boost profits but may have scared away some inflation-weary customers.

**Here's the juice:**  During the second quarter, Chipotle’s board approved an additional $300 million to repurchase shares of the company. 

This is just their initial approval and there are talks of more buybacks to come. When buybacks occur, stock prices go up. Chipotle is already trading at a price far too high for low income investors. Companies often choose to split their stock prior to buybacks to keep their stock attractive to investors. And that is what's about to happen. Stock splits have become somewhat of a trend the past two years as we've seen with Alphabet, Tesla, and Amazon. Chipotle is a strong company and knows what they're doing. Expect to see a split within the next month. Take it as you will.

In a vote on Thursday, state regulators are expected to approve a plan to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars over the next 13 years in America’s largest auto market. The move is being hailed as a major victory that could point the way forward for others.

“This is monumental,” said Daniel Sperling, a member of the California Air Resources Board (Carb), to CNN. “This is the most important thing that Carb has done in the last 30 years. It’s important not just for California, but it’s important for the country and the world.”

The vote comes two years after the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, issued an executive order requiring the sale of new cars to be zero-emission.

In 2021, only 12% of new cars sold in California were zero-emission, according to Carb. The new rule would require the state reach 35% of sales by 2026, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. It would not affect cars that are already on the road.

The measure, which Sperling said he was almost certain would pass, will be among the first of its kind and set an example to other states that often look to California when setting their own standards. Sperling told CNN the proposal faced “surprisingly little debate” and resistance from car makers, which have ramped up production of electric vehicles. General Motors has said it plans to sell only electric vehicles by 2035.

I know some of you struggle to find motivation with your loss porn.

But owning AMD will give you a reaction stronger than viagra.

AMD beat both on top and bottom lines, achieving 8 **record quarters of revenues**, hitting $6.6bn, with yearly **growth of 70%**.

As of today, both Intel and Nvidia have **MISSED** their Q2 earnings.

**Intel**: reported their **first quarterly loss since 2017**. Investors are **horrified**, as Pat's ""rearview mirror"" statement is haunting him. Their discrete GPU (ARC) is a **FAILURE**. Their Sapphire Rapids server chip for the datacenter are a no-show, while they keep losing share to EPYC.

[EVERYTHING IS DOWN... except taxes and R&amp;D expenditures](https://preview.redd.it/t3xrfh8cvtj91.jpg?width=1774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8132dee859292de04e93d2b901068b386c54a562)

**Nvidia**: just reported revenues of to $6.7bn, a  reduction of over $1bn from initial expectations. They can't get rid of their RTX 3000 over production. Next quarter guidance is $5.9 billion a HUGE drop from the $8.3bn last quarter and **LESS THAN AMD's revenue**.

[EVERYTHING DOWN... except Operating Expenses](https://preview.redd.it/c3mfoiu6wtj91.jpg?width=1704&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afae7ccda8dc43ff271f3db33ef2943518ed92dc)

**AMD PASSED NVIDIA IN SALES THIS QUARTER**

Not only AMD's revenues up by 70% thanks to the Xilinx integration, but AMD  is also entering the telecommunications and automotive industries. AMD is the ONLY semiconductor company that reiterated its 2022 guidance, while the competition is revising downwards.

[Data Center Growth of 83&amp;#37; year over year!!!](https://preview.redd.it/qjgha03mutj91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd82832d651c07aa2fa13f7ed6ee8a45f7265c0e)

**This year belongs to AMD.**

**Breaking down AMD by markets:**

**Client:**  Consumer PC's have dropped as we head into the second half of 2022. The exceptional demand created by COVID-19 is gone, as consumers have the equipment they need. AMD expects the rest of 2022 to have a mid-teen drop in sales, but still record and better than last year's.

**Gaming:**  which includes GPUs and gaming consoles, is getting hit from the GPU  side, as demand drops from mining drops and new GPUs coming out in the next 3 months (consumers hold their purchases  before new generation launches). However, expect the drop to be offset by console chips (Xbox, Playstation, Steam Deck, Aya, etc.), which have a sales spike in Q3.

**Embedded:**  Entirely comprised of Xilinx products is a door opener for AMD, as it  will increase its offering and TAM. Expect this business to continue growing at double digits.

**Datacenter:** the jewel of the crown, growing 83% year over year, is **VERY STRONG**  and continues to take market from Intel. Genoa, Genoa-X and Bergamo  Epyc chips will continue taking market from Intel. This market is bound  to become AMD's largest business next year.

SAMSUNG, TESLA, Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent... all major tech companies are buying AMD chips for their products and infrastructure.

To summarize, AMD's execution has been **ROCK SOLID**.

You now have a chance to buy the stock at double digits.... CALL NOW!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**AMD's Stock Price Target: ($120 for Q3, $150 for Q4, all time high in 2023).**

**Remember:** AMD launches Zen 4 Ryzen chips next month (September), as well as its RDNA3 Radeon High-end gaming GPUs in November, and the Genoa Epyc chips in Q4.

**This is AMD's BEST YEAR in terms of product launches.**

I expect AMD to hit its all time high in 2023, likely in the first half of the year.

It is heading to the moon, leaving the competition behind. All aboard!!!

Tesla’s stock on a split-adjusted basis will begin trading on August 25, 2022. Every shareholder of Tesla as of August 17, 2022, will get 2 additional shares of common stock for every one share held. After the closing session on August 24, the additional shares will be credited to the shareholder account.

Tesla stock price is quoting around $874.36 after the share closed 2.26% higher on August 23. TSLA shares are up by 14% and 41% over the last 1-month and 3-month periods. Over the last year, the share price of TSLA is up by 25 percent but is still down by 15.84 percent since January 2022.

Stock splits are popular among retail investors and help them add more to their portfolio and also bring in a new set of investors. As retail investors have expressed a high level of interest in investing in Elon Musk’s Tesla stock, the Stock Split will also make the stock more accessible to the retail shareholders.

Elon Musk holds 23.5 percent while The Vanguard Group holds 6 percent of Tesla’s shares. It remains to be seen how the stock price reacts once the share starts trading on a split-adjusted basis.

Prior to the Tesla stock split 2022, the company had enacted a 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020, after which TSLA shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis. After the previous stock split by Tesla, from August 2020 to June 6, 2022, Tesla’s stock price rose nearly 43.5%.

A 3-for-1 stock split of Tesla shares has already been approved by Tesla’s board of directors and the shareholder’s voting took place at Tesla’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on Thursday, August 4, 2022, at Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas.

A stock split has no fundamental change to the company’s financials other than increasing the number of shares that are outstanding by issuing more shares to the existing shareholders. After the stock split, the price falls, however, there is no change in the market capitalization of the company as the number of outstanding shares get increased.

776,1661340649,wwh30c,1,"A whistleblower’s complaint opens up new political and legal challenges for Twitter Inc. in Washington, as lawmakers and regulators examine possible responses to the social-media company’s alleged missteps.

The complaint from former Twitter security executive Peiter Zatko was filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which are expected to investigate.

The complaint was also sent to lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees, who pledged to conduct their own investigations.

“If these claims are accurate, they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D. Ill.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. “I will continue investigating this issue and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”

A Twitter spokeswoman said Mr. Zatko’s complaint, which was earlier reported by the Washington Post and CNN, was rife with “inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.”

Twitter declined to comment on possible congressional investigations.

The complaint comes as Twitter wages a legal battle in Delaware with Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk, who sought to buy the social-media company but has accused it of misrepresenting the prevalence of bots and fake accounts on its service.

Mr. Zatko’s complaint echoes some of what Mr. Musk has already alleged or questioned about Twitter’s user base and accuses the company of failing to protect sensitive user data and lying about its security problems.

Any regulatory response from Washington would take time to develop. The SEC in particular takes years to investigate and bring securities-fraud cases, and it isn’t clear whether Mr. Zatko’s claims would rise to that level.

The SEC could investigate Mr. Zatko’s allegations that the company and its executives understated or misrepresented the scope of spam or fake accounts on its platform.

To pursue an enforcement action, the SEC would need to find that any omitted or misleading information was material to shareholders, meaning it could influence a decision to buy or sell.

The SEC tends to probe many whistleblower tips and, if investigators find wrongdoing, can punish public companies that misled shareholders about material risks or financial metrics. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive payments equal to 10% to 30% of the fines collected if their information is original and helpful to an enforcement action.

Mr. Zatko’s decision to publicize his complaint is unusual for SEC whistleblowers, whose identities are kept secret by the SEC. Some whistleblowers choose to go public with their allegations because it can create more political and public support for an investigation.

It couldn’t be learned how much of Mr. Zatko’s information would be new to the SEC. Mr. Musk has waged a monthslong campaign to raise questions about how Twitter estimates and discloses the percentage of its monetized users who are bots or spam accounts.

“This reads like an overreach to make known and logical issues that likely have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny for months to appear as ‘original’ information under the SEC’s whistleblower statute,” said Jacob Frenkel,	

“The SEC’s investigative process will get to the core of what actually was said to whom and what was not disclosed and why,” he added. “SEC enforcement will separate financially motivated spin from fact.”

An SEC spokesman and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. The FTC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

I know you all in here are too busy worshipping Ryan Cohen, and with bag-holding GME and BBBY. You're flush with APE tokens. But do you want to make some real money? Then you better pay attention.

There's this car manufacturer called Xpeng. Yes, it's Chinese. Their CEO is a gross little man with a small member (statistically likely), but it's going to make you LOADS of money if you play your cards right.

This company does not innovate. No! They do what Chinese do best: make second rate copies of stuff but CHEAPLY so even regards like you can afford them. Can you afford a Tesla? I can't, yet. But I absolutely can afford a new Xpeng G9, and do you really think the average regarded gentleman on the street can tell the difference between that and a Tesla? Absolutely not.

Up until now, Xpeng cars were kind of rickety and you wouldn't want to be caught dead driving one on your way to Wendy's. But the X9? Looks like a Tesla, smells like a Tesla, is probably extremely unreliable, just like a Tesla. The X9 auto-pilot is free, and will kill you just as good as Tesla's will.

So here's the unique opportunity: the G9 is soon going to be released and it's amazing. But the market is currently valuing XPEV like they make the Chinese equivalent of Lada or something. But their new car can easily compete in developed markets like the US and in Europe. Even the French is going to buy them.

XPEV is easily going to 3x by Christmas.

Positions: just get some calls. LEAP:s or, if you really want to go big, something closer to November.

Or you can go back worshipping at the feet of Ryan Cohen, waiting for the...what again?...to occur Any Day Now. Your choice.

Aug 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled on Monday as investors fretted about a U.S. Federal Reserve gathering later this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that is expected to reinforce a strong commitment by the central bank to stamp out inflation.

All of 11 S&amp;P 500 sector indexes fell, led lower by consumer discretionary [**(.SPLRCD)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SPLRCD), down 2.7%, followed by a 2.6% loss in communication services [**(.SPLRCL)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SPLRCL).

Amazon [**(AMZN.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O) and Nvidia [**(NVDA.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/NVDA.O) each dropped more than 3%, while Microsoft [**(MSFT.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O) and Tesla [**(TSLA.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O) both lost more than 2% as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose past 3% for the first time since July 21.

 Technology and other higher-growth stocks often fall when bond yields rise.

After a summer rally on Wall Street ended last week, the S&amp;P 500 [**(.SPX)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SPX) remains down about 13% so far in 2022.

The CBOE Volatility index [**(.VIX)**](https://www.reuters.com/quote/.VIX), Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 23.8, its highest in over two weeks.

Focus is on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday at the central banking conference in Jackson Hole for further cues on how aggressively the Fed is likely to be with future interest rate hikes.

 ""Powell is going to try to sound hawkish to tamp down inflationary expectations and tighten financial conditions. So that's most likely going to be a negative catalyst for the market,"" warned Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.

The Fed will probably raise interest rates by 50 basis points in September, according to economists polled by Reuters.",Wall Street tumbles on fears of aggressive Fed,1.0,2022-08-22 19:46:18

The Inflation Reduction Act serves up a $7,500 tax credit to consumers for EVs priced up to $80,000 for trucks and $55,000 for cars. To qualify for the tax credit, buyers must earn less than $150,000 in household income if single or $300,000 as a household if married. The tax credit applies only to EVs assembled in North America.

&amp;#x200B;

When a stock has reached its maximum FUD is when you should be buying, not after the hype has been spread, and all the groupies jump on the ship.....

&amp;#x200B;

What we have seen is maximum FUD with many of the stocks, but one in particular, that being Blackberry. Evern on Reddit, they will not allow any upvoting to support what seems to me as a hostile take over actions of Blackberry, by who I am going to guess is Musk, as how can we know the true short position without a decentralized blockchain? As the endless selling and the manipulation from the insiders prove nothing here adds up.

When the run up came last year, why did the CEo jump out of the closet and scream - ""I have no idea why the share price has gone up""? And did he not dump a large amount of shares during this time (this I can not testify to though I am sure someone can verify this)? The next question why is he still hiding the facebook settlement? It has been 6 quarters and he is no longer collecting revenue which he was prior to the settlement, of say $50 million a quarter, and you can find anything on the quarterly reports, yet, he does wonderful in decimating the EPS. Another question, with all the partnerships and the IVY self driving software [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy) why has no revenue been declared for the 200 million vehicles it currently is installed in? And dont forget the 500 million on the backlog for installation, as we can all be aware these vehicles wont be driving themselves for free...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we review the patents the hold for cryptagraphy - [https://blackberry.certicom.com/en](https://blackberry.certicom.com/en) and the utility of blockchain security, as we can review any crypt project such IOTA with an $800 Million plus Market Cap, with no sustainable revenue or path forward, such is the greater fool theory. [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/)

&amp;#x200B;

Then of course comes the Cylance Security [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security) which has proven profitable, and now with former *McAfee* president John Giamatteo as president of its cyber security business unit, what amount of revenue will this generate... 

Now taking into account the partnerships throughout, for example, Microsoft, Amazon, (Meta as I am sure they are hiding the NDA as currently Meta is testing Blackberry End to End point Cryptagraphy for the messenger app throughout - WhatsApp, Instagram and FB - and their will be a large dollar figure paid to Blackberry quarterly on completion of the testing and implementation), and these are just a few players in the game..... 

Now reviewing the next item, how many EV manufactures has BB captured through out the global stage, with their self driving software? From my limited understanding I have been told all of them, excluding one, that being Tesla. And what did Tesla just do? Did they just not shutdown their auto pilot department? [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut) now why would they do such a thing?

Now then we come to the next item of concern, the Apple Killer, the Tesla PI Phone, now is this reliable or not?? Who am I to guess, though it makes sense,  [https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/](https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/) \- and where does this lead us, well Blackberry sure did create a great deal of despair when the legacy patent deal did not come through, though if you believe that deal was ever anymore than a jab to blind the investors, so they would give into more FUD, as the inside players are feasting on the insider knowledge, and the retail players are just being decimated, as i am sure if you do a bit of research it becomes clear very quickly the moral characters you are dealing with when you review the board members (one in particular who disgraces Warren buffet by referring to himself as the CDN one). 

And of course this post will get slaughtered by the reddit bots, who are against anyone doing anything other than holding bags, but for some reason, I would like to speak out and tell those who are having hard times to take a look at this, as the calls are cheap the SP is in the gutter, though all the fundamentals are in place, and it is evident management has been burning the books to ensure profitability is not seen, though what do I know I am just some guy who wishes he lived in his mom basement, though I am not that blessed...

Quick Summary notes of new fsd version

Added a new “deep lane guidance” module to the Vector Lanes neural network which fuses features extracted from the video streams with coarse map data, i.e. lane counts and lane connectivities. This architecture achieves a 44% lower error rate on lane topology compared to the previous model, enabling smoother control before lanes and their connectivities become visually apparent. This provides a way to make every Autopilot drive as good as someone driving their own commute, yet in a sufficiently general way that adapts for road changes.

Improved overall driving smoothness, without sacrificing latency, through better modeling of system and actuation latency in trajectory planning. Trajectory planner now independently accounts for latency from steering commands to actual steering actuation, as well as acceleration and brake commands to actuation. This results in a trajectory that is a more accurate model of how the vehicle would drive. This allows better downstream controller tracking and smoothness while also allowing a more accurate response during harsh maneuvers.

Improved unprotected left turns with more appropriate speed profile when approaching and exiting median crossover regions, in the presence of high-speed cross traffic (“Chuck Cook style” unprotected left turns). This was done by allowing an optimizable initial jerk, to mimic the harsh pedal press by a human when required to go in front of high-speed objects. Also improved lateral profile approaching such safety regions to allow for a better pose that aligns well for exiting the region. Finally, improved interaction with objects that are entering or waiting inside the median crossover region with better modeling of their future intent.

Added control for arbitrary low-speed moving volumes from Occupancy Network. This also enables finer control for more precise object shapes that cannot be easily represented by a cuboid primitive. This required predicting velocity at every 3D voxel. We may now control for slow-moving UFOs.

Upgraded Occupancy Network to use video instead of images from single time step. This temporal context allows the network to be robust to temporary occlusions and enables the prediction of occupancy flow. Also, improved ground truth with semantics-driven outlier rejection, hard example mining, and increasing the dataset size by 2.4x.

Upgraded to a new two-stage architecture to produce object kinematics (e.g. velocity, acceleration, yaw rate) where network compute is allocated O(objects) instead of O(space). This improved velocity estimates for far away crossing vehicles by 20%, while using one-tenth of the compute.

Increased smoothness for protected right turns by improving the association of traffic lights with slip lanes vs yield signs with slip lanes. This reduces false slowdowns when there are no relevant objects present and also improves yielding position when they are present.

Reduced false slowdowns near crosswalks. This was done with an improved understanding of pedestrian and bicyclist intent based on their motion",tesla releases new fsd version,1.0,2022-08-21 16:04:14

810,1660891534,ws6xo3,1,"Dear my highly regarded autumns, I shall tell you my story, now that it feels somewhat relevant with how the BBBY saga ended. I try to be as short as I can, because I know that most of you has an attention span of a crayon.

Everything started in 2018, when I married my wife and decided that I don't want to throw away my life working as others do. I bought some 90% off Udemy courses, took a $33k zero interest loan (we can do it where I live if we pinky promise the government that we will make children in 5 years), then unlike you, autumns, learnt, searched, and made due diligence on companies for over a thousand hours. 

I searched for companies which dropped a lot in price with huge upside, either by being mispriced or having catalysts.  This is how I first found NIO, then GME (found both on finviz stock screener). First I bought 2020 Jan calls (somewhere between $6 and $12 strike, I don't exactly remember) on NIO just before their abysmal Q2 ER came out in 2019. It dropped to $2, then $1.5, my $33k 'investment' went to $3k basically instantly. What would a highly regarded person do in my place? Obviously I sold at a 80-90% loss, then got a 5 year $6k loan with huge interest to buy lower strike priced calls. At that point (October of 2019 I think) literally every article about NIO was about it going bankrupt in 2 weeks, but I knew (reading their ir docs) that they have enough funds for 2 years at their current money-burn rate. I also estimated that they will be either really close to profitability (they already had like 20% profit margins on cars sold, but they hemorrhaged money on R&amp;D and battery swap), or even be profitable. At that point 2022 (or '21?) Jan $3 strike leap calls were only cost $0.3 each (so $30 for 100 shares), so I bought as much as I could. NIO stock was ~20-40 times cheaper compared to Tesla at the time by revenue generated and cars sold compared to market cap. Then I had my first huge luck, the EV hype started, and were going crazy. I cashed out for 10x gains, now I had $100k.

My next play was GME. At the time Ryan Cohen was nowhere yet, and there everyone was laughing on DFV for YOLO-ing on it. I didn't see his posts, but found GME roughly the same time as him. My thesis consisted a couple of points, the most important were the huge short float (close to 100% shorted officially), 3 times more net cash compared to debt, new management (again, the guys before Cohen, but they were also just elected too. They got new people on board like former Nintendo America president Reggie, made a deal with Microsoft etc.), and the new console cycle (a HUGE catalyst, or as I thought). I bought shares at the $4 range, for $50-60k. My price target was $40 at the time, which would have put GameStops market cap to 2/3 of their ath before if I remember correctly. Well, turns out I was wrong on the old-new management and the New cycle, the new cycle hasnt helped much and later Reggie left, but RC and the apes saved me.

The thing is, when the squeeze started instead of living on hopium I instantly subscribed to places like Ortex and ShortSight, while closely monitoring the short interest on free sites too like iborrowdesk (which follows the shorts on Interactive Brokers). Being there before everyone else and doing this helped me making life-changing money. I first sold half my position at $80, then half of the remaining at $160, then again half $320 if I remember correctly, then all the remaining when a lot of brokers turned off the buy button, all the while monitoring the short interest and float closely on Ortex and ShortSight. The day when big brokers turned off the buy button there were still like 50-80 million shares traded hands, people sold and most shorts could cover, some going basically bankrupt in the process (like Melvin Capital, who was on life-support after this and gone bankrupt recently).

TLDR: The extremely important lesson from this is that the stock market is not a team game, it never was and never will be. It is about YOU. You can find great opportunities, but only if you learn a lot, do a fukton of DD and have a first-mover advantage. Also, having a shartton of luck helps a lot.

No no no they just took the bait. This is all part of the strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Recall the strategic move that Musk do when Tesla was rallying?

He twitted ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"" 

That caused a temporary dip (killed numerous FDs), but resulted in a bigger rip.

You just saw what Ryan Cohen did:  a strategic sacrifice.

As they say ""History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.""

So this concludes our lesson: with even greater dip, would result in a even greater rip.

Oh I'm sorry, did you think this rocket ship was landing on the moon *of Earth????* Haha um, no sweetie, that would imply our gains stop here which is quite comical. 

You see, we are witnessing what is called a ""short squeeze"" which in financial terms means ""unfathomably large green dildo"".

According to the sleuths here, Ryan Cohen has call positions between the $60-80 mark. That is a 300-400% gain from where we are right now. What does that mean? I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with being able to summon instagram thots to your lambo on command. I think it means buying groceries without checking the price. I think it means buying a Tesla and filling it with gasoline anyways because why not?

824,1660790570,wr7sh8,1,"It sounds like Form 144 is all the rage right now, and rightfully so.  I was doing some research on how form 144 is used and if there are use cases where a high level member of a company ""files the form 144 ahead of time"" to use at their convenience.

I came across this reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Series7/comments/qrl7xk/as_of_yesterday_elon_musk_has_sold_5_billion_of/)at the r/Series7 which looks like its a reddit for test prep.  The question they ask in the post is related to form 144.  The part I found relevant to BBBY's situation is quoted below:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Elon's FORM 144 was dated September 14. He can sell the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Tesla or the average of the last four weeks trading volume of Tesla as of September 14 in the 90 days following. He has to file FORM 4 within two days for any sales and he continues to do so.

 This lead me to ask ""What is Form 4?""

According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form4.asp):

&amp;#x200B;

* Form 4 must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders.
* If a party fails to disclose required information on a Form 4, civil or criminal actions could result.
* **It must be filed within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred.**

I then wondered ""how have form 144 and form 4 been used in other situations?""  I decided to use TSLA as my case study:

Example 1 - Andrew Baglino -  Sell 1,500 TSLA shares: 

[Form 144](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER/16776) \- Approximate Date of Sale 03/01/21 

[Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000179056521000003/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml)\- Box 2 - Transaction Date 03/01/21

&amp;#x200B;

Example 2 - Jerome Guillen - Sell 30,000 TSLA shares:

[Form 144](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER/17482) \- Approximate Date of Sale 03/10/21

[Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000158451821000004/xslF345X03/primary_doc.xml) \- Box 2 - Transaction Date - 03/10/21

&amp;#x200B;

These are just two random examples that may not be perfect 1:1 examples to RC Ventures, but I'm no expert and just trying to understand the potential scenarios ahead of us.  It does look like if RC Ventures did sell, they would be required by law (given the holding size) to file a Form 4 within 2 business days of selling.

&amp;#x200B;

Not financial advice, I could be wrong, good luck and stay safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, margin is not where it should be. However, with a slow decrease in inflation, robotics, and scale, margins should start to look better with the quarters coming forward. TTCF revenue grew 15% even though their product's prices are the highest in the freezer aisle. Also, like TESLA, TTCF is vertically integrated. Therefore, they will be able to lower their costs and become more efficient in the long-term. TTCF is in every major retailer. Since the sell through has been high, stores are increasing their shelf space. TTCF is also expanding their product offering with higher margin products in the short term: snacks and refrigerated items. When TTCF starts becoming profitable, this stock will move-especially with the high short position. Wall Street is usually two to three steps ahead. When large investment firms have permission to enter, when TTCF becomes profitable, TTCF will shoot up like a rocket creating an incredible short squeeze. The time to own this company is now when the company is inching upward at a very slow rate. 

Disclosure: I do own the stock as well as long-term options extending past the date of when they will likely be profitable. Also, like Jeremy from Financial Education, I am long on this stock. It may be too early for most short-term investors to buy this stock. However, I would like to put this stock on small retail investors' radar; it is hard to predict when big money will come into the scene creating large upward movement.

A public event planning company is helping many wallstreetsbets users learn to make profit trading BBBY. The energetic CEO of the Atlanta maybe, maybe not public planning company says they even have a meeting as a celebration party in February 2023.

“We have so much invested already. BBBY — will eventually surpass Elon Musk’s TESLA on the stock market. Training is going good! More people are buying, and that is good for the American economy. Elon, Ryan, and I are all good for American small time investors.”

Bold prediction. What do you think? Does GameStop’s Ryan Cohen believe it could happen? Would this be good for those who have coin and BBBY in their portfolios? Is Elon behind the latest coin uptrends? What do you think? One thing is for sure the Mom and pop American will be the winner either way!

So expect the unexpected once word gets back to Elon about this. The purpose is to gain exposure and bring in coin investors. Their coins are low in price so they have money to bet on both.

You can join and become a share holder in what we are building. 

Obviously lots of meetings to report more in the future, but the first is scheduled. Not only can you get rich trading correctly, now our OCCUPY WALLSTREET movement is being grown into a full blown company. We already have a lawyer, and I am the CEO. We operate near Atlanta, Georgia. Again zero cost, but you get an opportunity to compete to be a 1099 contractor with our company. You will get additional tax breaks, and even share holder status, voting rights, and influence. Plus after the profits increase, I would love for the board to vote on a dividend. Then we eventually list on the stock market. 

We are a private company now, but I have a vision for more. So join what we are doing. We are tomorrow’s future. So what’s our product?

Our products is “organization.” We package organizing into a fun experience, for profit. You are already aware of some of the services a company like ours would provide. If you know who Eric Thomas is, or Tony Robbins, then maybe you have seen them speak at a huge event planned by a for profit company. 

Some of you maybe, maybe not have ever went to a big arena to see and hear him. With the pandemic subsiding we have lots of profits to take home. You all can share in your fair share as a result of the risk you wager and energy you expend doing our work. 

Our work is the work to benefit the Mom and pop retail investors like you. Why? Well I am just like many of you. We are like each other more than we are different. 

There is no better place for “event planners” to make money commercially then in hosting events for the stock market lovers of our future, with stock market lovers as the employees, and services designed for new stock market retail investors by stock market retail investors, the world will change. 

For sure the US will change for the better. Profits will be shared more fairly. The rich will still be known, but the disparity between the rich and the poor in America will change. 

Some of you know why? Some of you don’t. Some of you are just here for money. So be your own boss. Get a 1099 each year. Have a home office, and work from home. 

We have so much to share, but obviously this is not the proper forum for dialogue. I want to hear from you. So call me. My number can be asked for if you send me a request via inbox. 

We are not going to share our complete hand, because our company already exists in a competitive market. We also already own a tech company, and a lobbying company. Now I know someone wants to call “he is crapping me” but this is as real as GME +300 is. Obviously everyone in the world will not be employed by us, but you really can. This is easier than most of you think. It’s easier to become debt free, and bring in income if you know how to design your life in a way that is fun! 

That is what we are about fun! Serious event planners apply. Send your reason for wanting to participate as formally or informally as you want to my inbox. I will be looking for only the best talent. I am looking for new additions to the wallstreetsbets bets movements, and old Apes who helped occupy Wall Street. 

There is a lot of money in the world, many of you all see that now. I want to show you more. The humble will respond, those who this is not for will use their valuable time and reply with none sense. I hope you respond to me. Either way, no this is going on in the background. 

We also have a second lawyer on retainer for criminal offenses. Wall Street hedge fund managers who have been using risky practices for years are going to see we are manipulating a market. We are going to say we are doing what we are doing. Planning fun events, and connecting like minded people with like minded people. 

Our first event maybe, maybe not will occur in Atlanta Georgia in February! To be determined exactly if this is a service our community wants. You will be the buyers so you matter the most. 
That is something companies forget.


Maybe hosted at the Hyatt, but many of you will rent Air B&amp;Bs. Research Atlanta. I welcome you to our city. 

It’s so much to discuss, and debrief. There are more investment cycles to start and bull. We bull, and we have fun! That is the way!

So I invite you to come listen and learn our Company core values and mission for a more peaceful world.  This was the event we have been waiting on!

In closing, our future, and our company will be the official host you can count on for these events. Even if you find another competitor in this market, at least you can respect that we took BBBY to be more costly than Elon Musk’s Tesla. 

Seriously, that is my prediction, and I have a friend who use to work in SpaceX who maybe, maybe not will help. Imagine this:

Hopefully there will be a hedge fund manager who we caused to lose money with us by then. Imagine then explaining why you inspired them to  chose our side and support BBBY, as they figured things out. How many times have you wanted more support?

When you really think about why would anyone bet on companies in a way that increases the likelihood of bankruptcy? Is that what we do now as humans. We bet to unemploy our human family members. No as an activist I have to speak a new possibility.


I am not here to say, I have a solution for how the market was designed, but as a lobbyist who passed laws in states I know design is key to reality reinforcers which yield problems. Can you imagine a new futuristic stock market that helps the US economy? 

Fans of us from the global economy would bet to preserve the companies traded there. You all could still be meme stock traders, or again work for the company I am describing. Either way, keep the BBBys going, and remember organizing and event planning is key to making money. 

Check the technicals. We are about to have a new bottom. Also Google “circuit breakers” and how they are used to prevent a free fall of a stock from crashing. So we always get a new bottom. 

Many are not aware circuit breakers are a part of new age trading! So join us! Maybe, maybe not. We just have to create the inspiration to make an Mt Everest climb. Is it possible?

Imagine our publicly held BBBY company going hire than Elon’s Tesla! That is the bet I am making. Sharing on Twitter! 😉 

Elon we are coming for you respectfully. Will we moon higher than Tesla? Only you can decide if it happens!

844,1660581133,wp42q0,1,"Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" sold virtually all of his US stocks last quarter.

Burry's Scion Asset Management only held a $3.3 million stake in Geo Group, a new filing shows.

Scion owned $165 million of stocks at the end of March, excluding its Apple put options.

Michael Burry, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame, slashed his US stock portfolio to a single holding in the second quarter, a SEC filing revealed on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosed just over 500,000 shares of Geo Group worth $3.3 million. Geo invests in private prisons and mental health facilities, and commands a market capitalization of less than $900 million.

Close followers of Burry are likely to interpret his decision to effectively liquidate his portfolio as a bad omen. The hedge fund manager diagnosed the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" last summer, and warned owners of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were careening towards the ""mother of all crashes.""

More recently, he has cautioned investors not to get too excited about the recent rally in stocks, as previous downturns have seen lots of temporary rebounds before finding a bottom. 

Scion's portfolio comprised 11 stocks worth $165 million at the end of March, excluding bearish put options it held against 206,000 Apple shares.

The Scion chief has taken a knife to his portfolio in the past. He pared it from 20 holdings to six in the third quarter of last year, reducing its value from $140 million to $42 million in the space of three months.

Burry shot to fame after his billion-dollar wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in the book and the movie ""The Big Short."" He's also known for betting against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation fund last year, and for investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock.

847,1660514737,woi3jg,1,"Hey all--

I hope you had a nice and relaxing weekend! I wanted to write up a brief update before we get into the next week of trading. You can read my original DD thread [here](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wlqb4q/desktop_metal_dd_long_term_tenbagger_and/)).

**Highlights from my weekend thread:**

Check out this [graph](https://imgur.com/a/4AUlHnG) detailing short sale volume this month along with a graph of its performance. We've seen daily short volume ratios over 40% for the past month, and short volume ratios over 55% for the past two days and DM has continued to run. 

Compare the graph of the last week to that of July 13th. On the 7/20 daily volume reached over 7mm with a short volume ratio of over **70%**. DM fell $0.20. Compare that to a few days ago on 8/11 when trade volume hit 8mm with a short volume ratio of 70% with DM experiencing a heavy sell-off **which it rallied through** closing up for the day. Despite continued short interest with a short volume ratio of 60% on trading volume of 4mm yesterday 8/12, DM rallied 5%. I got my data [here](https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=DM).

**Why it's important:**

We're seeing DM continued to rally past heavy short interest this month in a compelling reversal from July. If you compare the chart from July 2nd to July 14th and August 1st to 12th, you'll see a similar beginning pattern but post earnings in August, DM has busted through previous resistance and significant pressure from shorts.

I've started an Excel file where I'll be tracking daily short volume which I will update weekly. You can find that [here](https://imgur.com/a/VDnfEEM). Currently it has data from the last two trading weeks but more data can be found on the FINRA website [here](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/browse-catalog/short-sale-volume-data/daily-short-sale-volume-files).

**What's next:**

Honestly, who knows. I'd love to just come out with some outlandish figure like the people unapologetically giving end-of-week and end-of-month price targets for BBBY of outrageous figures but nobody really knows where a stocks price will be even a day in the future. I want to keep my DD as grounded in data as possible. 

The biggest thing to watch out for is general market sentiment. If growth stocks continue their positive momentum as the Fed looks more dovish during the second half of the year (at least compared to where they were 3 months ago), DM should have a solid second half of 2022. The next major catalyst set in stone will be Q3 earnings which are scheduled to take place after hours on November 9th. Currently, options are pricing in a 38% move in either direction. 

As we've seen in the past, positive news has been a significant catalyst for DM. Blue chip adoption, expanded facilities due to increased interest in the flagship P-50 System, and other events have led to rapid 20%+ jumps. I would not be surprised to see several such events leading up to Q3 earnings as Ric and the rest of the team hope to emphasize their strong balance sheet and increasingly clear path to profitability in 2023. 

**Conclusion:**

This last month has been monumental for DM. Market sentiment towards the company could not be more different between Q1 and Q2 earnings. It reminds me of market sentiment towards Tesla when they finally proved they could return a profit in 2019 which began a long and continued appreciation in their stock price that I'm sure you've all witnessed. I made my first $30,000 trading Tesla options pre-split on it's run up. I have conviction that this is a very similar situation. I'm excited to see what happens in the coming months and years but I do believe this is the perfect time to start building an equity position if you don't have one already. If you're interested in calls, I'd do longer dated 2023 or 2024 ITM or ATM calls. 


**My current position:**

500 shares @ $3.14

10 $2 calls for Jan 19th, 2024

10 $5 calls for Jan 19th, 2023

5 $7.5 calls for Jan 19th, 2023

851,1660383330,wnah0e,1,"Disclaimer: I'm not supporting war but just write here to warn public about this would be highly likely. 

Speaker Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan lately, I think, it’s a very smart strategic movement but terrible for economy. Why it’s a smart strategic move because she knew CCP would not start the war right now, especially this year, this time. 

Here are a few major reasons why CCP is not ready for the war this year:

1. Political reason: CCP’s leader Xi is preparing for securing his third term which will be decided within next 2 months. This third term is unprecedented since China’s new era after Cultural revolution in last century. Once he secured his third term and passed this millstone, he would be in essence the lifelong leader (kind of the one in North Korea). A war right now would give him extra troubles to seek supports within the party. 

2. Economic reason: Chinese economy is currently deeply entangled with US economy in every aspect ranging from banking to manufacturing sectors. When Russian banks were ousted from SWIFT system, it really warned the China about the consequences. 

3. Food security reason: China still heavily rely on the imported foods from various western countries. China was the largest market for U.S. agricultural exports in recent years. But this may about to change, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture that by mid-2022, China will hold 69% of the world’s corn reserves, 60% of its rice and 51% of its wheat. Think about the reason why CCP is hoarding the food.

4. Chinese people are not supporting the war currently, regardless how the official CCP medias’ propaganda, most Chinese people don’t want a war. And they are mostly prone to western ideologies especially in big cities due to the benefits and openness gained in recent decades.  

However, the above situations will be changed in next 5 years Once Xi secured his third terms. And I believe there would be 80% chance CCP would start war with Taiwan once Xi secured his terms for the following reasons:

1. Political agenda: Every Chinese leader has a historical mission which is reuniting Taiwan. Current president Xi got this even strongly, based on his own personal experience that I believe his biggest desire/goal is to surpass the Chinese greatest leader Chair Mao (and he has been imitate him in every aspect in recent years). In order to achieve this, he has to do something Mao has not achieved which is the unification of Taiwan by force. If he can managed to achieve this, he would become the greatest leader in CCP history which is a dream for all autocratic leader in history. 

2. Economy decoupling with US: China is now switching this so-called “Dual Circulation” economic model which intended to reduce the GDP growth reliance on western imports and exports and technology such as massive supporting own semiconductor industry, and developing own cryptocurrency and making changes in financial industry including delisting state-owned firms from US equity market.

3. Energy decoupling with western world: According to recent data, Russia become China's biggest oil supplier exceeding Saudi. Additionally, Chinese domestic EV car has already surpassed Tesla in its domestic market. 

4. Food security: as mentioned above. By 2022, China holds 69% of the world’s corn reserves, 60% of its rice and 51% of its wheat. China is buying more foods form US where as selling massive of US treasuries. Also at home, CCP is encouraging and supports self-sustaining agricultural industry. Their current food stockpiles reached historically high level but US treasuries was in lowest level, according to China’s National Food Reserves that their food stockpiles can meet demand for one and a half years. 

5. Political propaganda domestically. CCP is starting a massive psychological decoupling from US such as weakening English study in education and forbidding western holidays and English terminology etc. all kinds of propaganda. 

The above factors are all signals to me that CCP is preparing the war. However, western world has been mostly underestimated their determinations of taking Taiwan by force. By and large, most western companies are underestimating this risk, especially the ones in Wall Street. I’m writing this is not to asking western to prepare the war but to try to avoid it. Anyway, I have a family and certainly don’t want this war to happen as it may trigger the third world war. As a result, I can only tell that I’m pretty pessimistic for the future in next few years. General public like us should be prepared for this potential threats.","Why I’m thinking CCP is not going to start a war with Taiwan and US this year, but it’s very likely in next 5 years.",1.0,2022-08-13 09:35:30

1. Musk agreed to buy out all shares of Twitter for $54.20 per share and take the company private.
2. Tesla shares dropped substantially, as a reaction Musk pulled out of the deal. His reason cited is bots, but he’s already displayed that he believed there was a bot problem before he made a formal offer.
3. I read the contract Musk signed and it’s apparent that he signed away his right to act on information that Twitter provides him. It does say that he can ask for info, but that provision seems be be purely for helping to take ownership of the company. He can’t drop out of the deal even if 100% of the users were bots, based on how this contract is written.
4. Judge McCormick has fast tracked the trial to October, signaling that she favors Twitter’s interests.
5. McCormick has, in the past, dealt with similar cases and has forced the buyer to close every time except once, which had something to do with a company that was literally committing crimes.

**Oh, God... not this again... WHAT NOW?!**

Well, little monkey, read on and ye shall see... This week, the company reported its 2022Q2 results - of which the following is of quite significant importance.

\- Firstly, the company reported record revenue of $57.7 million, up 204% from second quarter 2021, and an increase of 32% sequentially from first quarter 2022 along with increasing margins - demonstrating **exponential growth is still very much on track**.

\- Second of all, the company announced during the quarter their **""Strategic Integration and Cost Optimization Initiative""** to increase the pace of ""Additive Manufacturing 2.0"" by **reducing their liabilities, losses and ensure their path to profitability remains on track**. This involves simplifying its operational structure, working the synergies between all of their subsidiaries to maximise efficiency, and continued investment in innovation of their technology - **saving them $100M over 24 months.**

\- Finally, and most importantly, the company r**eaffirmed full year 2022 guidance** of approximately $260 million for revenue, representing **131% growth from 2021**, and approximately $(90) million for adjusted EBITDA - **meaning reaching breakeven and profitability by late 2023 is very much on track.**

The company continues to demonstrate growth and IP dominance in the AM sector through the further adoption of their various systems, and continue to expand their client base amongst various industry leaders, blue chips, and government. Their current client base features such names as **Tesla,** BMW, Toyota, **Ford**, Medtronic, Adidas, **Amazon**, Cartier, Bose, LG, **Caterpillar,** Siemens, **General Electric, Space X, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon,** Airbus, **The United States Air Force, Army, Navy and DOD,** Shapeways, amongst many, **MANY** others who continue to adopt and integrate Desktop Metal's machines into their design, prototyping and mass manufacturing.

**Each of their flagship P-50 Production Systems generates a 10-year lifetime value of $4.3M**, along with the flagship **Xtreme 8K's $1.4M 7-year lifetime value** \- let alone all of their other products such as those in their **rapidly expanding healthcare subsidiaries**, of which there are **already 1000+ printers installed and in regular service globally**.

After the annihilation of last earnings' report on the share price, sending the stock down to an unholy all-time low of $1.26 on a viciously red day (-67%), the trend has been solidly upwards back towards $3, where it is currently testing the 100MA. *(I tried to tell you you'd be missing out on at least 80% gains, blame the mods of* r/wallstreetbets *and* r/stocks *for taking the post down).*

Weekly RSI remains low, and it has broken previous resistance at around $2.65, gaining close to 30% this week alone at the time of writing. I'm expecting a retest of the uptrend around $2.70 next week, and a break above the 100MA to fill the gap and meet the 200MA at around $3 in late September/early October. Beyond that, near term resistance at $3.40 and $4. I feel confident that between fundamentals, float size and short interest, in the next 12 months the stock will reach pre-merger levels of $9-10 in anticipation of breakeven in 2023Q4, and I retain my 10-year price targets.

It's Elon Musk !

Today I would like to share with you an excerpt from my ""thought diary"", so that those who think I am strange and incomprehensible will be proven wrong !

&amp;#x200B;

1. I absolutely want to know my wealth safe.

2. what is the risk?

3. it depends for better or worse on the stock market price of my Tesla shares.

4. solution: take chips off the table

5. problem: I can't do it anonymously... WTF ! If I do it anyway, there will be panic among the investors, who will think: holy cow, if he of all people, who knows best about Tesla's future, is pessimistic, then I better run away as fast as possible !

The Senate on Sunday passed the bill that’s designed to fight climate change, make significant tax changes, trim the federal deficit, cut drug prices for Medicare recipients and extend expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. As it moves to the House of Representatives, the roster of the winners and losers under the bill is coming into sharper focus even before it goes to President Joe Biden.

For both winners and losers, the impact is more modest than you would think, given the sheer size of the numbers being bandied about. That’s because of details like strings attached to some of the new or extended tax breaks, or the schedule for implementing Medicare’s negotiations with big pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.

Changes will be more gradual than many headlines imply.

Beginning with the biggest-dollar provisions of the 10-year package of spending and tax cuts, these are some of the effects American corporations and citizens will see from the law. The two biggest changes are the bill’s deficit reducers – just two provisions of the law that account for 80% of its $300 billion in deficit reduction, according to Moody’s Analytics.

Losers:

Big tax-avoiding corporations

Drug companies (but not as much as you think)

Public company shareholders

Winners:

Car companies (but maybe not Tesla)

Utilities and homeowners

Hedge funds (for now)

899,1659966436,wj9ach,1," Centi-billionaire Elon Musk provoked Twitter and challenged the company’s CEO Parag Agrawal to a “public debate” about fake accounts and spam in the midst of a contentious legal battle over a $44 billion acquisition.

Musk filed a bid with the Securities and Exchange to acquire Twitter back in April this year. After the companies agreed to move ahead with a take-private deal, Musk said he was terminating his acquisition, and accused Twitter of presenting false numbers, including in its SEC filings, pertaining to the amount of monetizable daily active users, and the number of spam and bot accounts on the social network.

Twitter then sued Musk in a Delaware chancery court to ensure the deal would go through as promised, and Musk filed counterclaims and a countersuit there on July 29.

In a series of tweets that Musk began posting just before 1 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 6, Musk interacted with a fan who had summarized his accusations about Twitter including that it was stonewalling him and giving him, “outdated data,” and “a fake data set” when he asked the company for details about how it tabulates mDAU, and estimates for spam and bot accounts.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO wrote, “Good summary of the problem. If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms. However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.”

By just after 9 a.m. Saturday morning, Musk started a Twitter poll asking his followers to vote on whether ”\[l\]ess than 5% of Twitter daily users are fake/spam.” Respondents to the informal poll could choose one of Musk’s provided answers which read either “Yes” followed by three robot emoji, or “Lmaooo no.” (The slang abbreviation “lmao” stands for “laughing my a-- off.)

Musk also wrote Saturday morning: “I hereby challenge @ paraga to a public debate about the Twitter bot percentage. Let him prove to the public that Twitter has &lt;5% fake or spam daily users!”

https://preview.redd.it/amkck3gpuhg91.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a8f425a8e7a37c8a595d946334766a6915aaa81

 A source close to the company says a debate is not going to happen outside of a pending trial.

Attorneys for Musk did not respond to requests to comment on Saturday, and an attorney for Twitter declined to comment on Musk’s Saturday tweets.

Twitter’s attorneys have argued in court filings that Musk gave the company just twenty-four hours to accept his offer before he would present it directly to Twitter shareholders, and waived due diligence including a chance to seek more information on false or spam accounts.

They wrote in court filings, “Musk’s repeated mischaracterizations of the merger agreement cannot change its plain words.”

At an annual shareholder meeting for Tesla on Aug. 4, Musk was asked to speak about Twitter during a question-and-answer session that followed a proxy vote.

He said, drawing laughter from the audience in attendance, “I obviously have to be a little careful what I say about Twitter because there’s this lawsuit and stuff.” He confirmed that the only two publicly traded securities he owns are Tesla and Twitter.

And then he spoke as if he still wants to become the owner of the social networking company, a stark contrast to arguments made by Musk via his attorneys in legal filings in Delaware in which Musk argues he should not have to go through with the deal.

At the Tesla 2022 shareholders’ meeting, Musk said: “I think in the case of Twitter since I use it a lot, shoot myself in the foot a lot, you know, dig my grave, etc. I think it’s — I do understand the product quite well, so I think I’ve got a good sense of where to point the engineering team at Twitter to make it radically better.”

He added that Twitter would “help accelerate” a “pretty grand vision” he had to build a business he’d been thinking about since his earliest years as a tech entrepreneur, X.com or X Corporation.

“Obviously that could be started from scratch,” he said, “but I think Twitter would help accelerate that by three to five years. So it’s kind of like something I’ve thought would be quite useful for a long time. I know what to do. Don’t have to have Twitter for that but, like I said, it’s probably at least a three-year accelerant and I think it’s something that will be very useful to the world.”

Musk didn’t go into any further details at that meeting. However, he reportedly said during a town hall meeting with Twitter employees in June this year that he wanted to grow Twitter’s user base to a billion people and saw Twitter as a platform that could evolve into an app like China’s WeChat, a “super app,” that incorporates everything from messaging, video and social media, to mobile and point-of-sales payments, with a robust app ecosystem.

Unless they reach a settlement first, Twitter and Musk are headed for a five-day trial in Delaware that starts on Oct. 17. The judge ruling on the case is Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick.

Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/06/elon-musk-challenges-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-to-a-debate-on-bots.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/06/elon-musk-challenges-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-to-a-debate-on-bots.html)

...My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. The following  is a summarization of my answer.  


My Thesis on this Play is as follows -  
I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..

  
After the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.

  
…Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it’s lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- “Buy Buy Baby”. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.

  
With GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC’s cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)

As GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  
That said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.

  
Again, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I’m glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.

  
So again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of “meme basket” and bed Bath &amp; beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.

  
So back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME’s stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.

  
I waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time… either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.

  
As things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  
Then last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.

&amp;#x200B;

After watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post… I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)….  
Anyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.

  
The stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  
So yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  
Eventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.

  
Thursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.

  
Friday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  
So yeah… I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  
Again, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of “MOASS” like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.

  
As one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  
 It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.

  
In closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn’t go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).

Hey guys, if you have not seen my Yolo post, here is a shot of the position at the time ….





. My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. Here is a summarization of my answer- 

My Thesis on this Play is as follows - 

 I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..

After the URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. 

So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and subsequent -50% day - the CEO stepped down, and the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.

…Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in march) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it’s lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- “Buy Buy Baby”. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated. 

With GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies  with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces on Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which she is just about flawlessly executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market. Especially considering RC’s cost basis is $15. In addition he holds millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options expiring January 23.

As GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon. 

That said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen‘s factor.

dividend, and a gift from the company.

By [Russ Mitchell](https://www.latimes.com/people/russ-mitchell) Staff Writer    Aug. 5, 2022 1:03 PM PT     

The  California Department of Motor Vehicles has accused Tesla of false  advertising in its promotion of the company’s signature Autopilot and  Full Self-Driving technologies.

The agency alleges the electric  carmaker misled customers with advertising language on its website  describing Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies as more capable  than they actually are.

The company “made or disseminated  statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts,” the  DMV said in a pair of complaints filed with the state Office of  Administrative Hearings on July 28.

The DMV complaints point to  the very names of the technologies, as well as other “misleading”  language such as the following, which [appears](https://www.tesla.com/en_AE/autopilot/%3Fredirect%3Dno) on the Tesla’s website Autopilot page:

“All  you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you  don’t say anything, your car will look at your calendar and take you  there as the assumed destination. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal  route, navigating urban streets, complex intersections and freeways.”

The  remedies proposed by the DMV if it prevails could be severe, including  revocation of the company’s licenses to make or sell its cars in  California. But actual remedies would likely be much softer.

A DMV  spokesperson said Friday via email that if its action succeeds, “the  DMV will ask that Tesla will be required to advertise to consumers and  better educate Tesla drivers about the capabilities of its ‘Autopilot’  and ‘Full Self-Driving’ features, including cautionary warnings  regarding the limitations of the features, and for other actions as  appropriate given the violations.”

In June, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk underlined the importance of Full Self-Driving to the company. Without FSD, Tesla is “[worth basically zero](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6),” he said.

The  Full Self-Driving feature costs $12,000 and purports to automatically  pilot the car on freeways, city streets and neighborhood roads;  automatically obey traffic signals; and roam a parking lot without a  driver to park itself.

Despite the name, no car available for  purchase by individuals is capable of fully autonomous driving from  Tesla or any other company.

Tesla cars never could “and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles,” the DMV claims assert.

The  DMV notes that Tesla’s website states that “the currently enabled  features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle  autonomous.”

But, the DMV said, the disclaimer “contradicts the  original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading,  and does not cure the violation.”

Tesla’s driver-assisting  technologies have been popular features that help the carmaker stand out  in an increasingly crowded electric vehicle market. But YouTube videos  showing its systems placing cars in dangerous situations have drawn  attention, including near head-on collisions with trucks and trains that  require a driver to yank the steering wheel to avoid a crash. One video  appears to show Tesla’s sensor system confusing the moon for a traffic  light stuck on yellow.

Autopilot, a less expensive feature that  combines automatic cruise control with automatic steering and automatic  lane changes, came under investigation by the National Highway and  Traffic Administration when Teslas showed a pattern of plowing into  emergency vehicles parked by the roadside.

It’s unclear how many  crashes involve Full Self-Driving technology, and if any of those  crashes have led to death or injury. Tesla’s onboard computers are  capable of communicating that information over the air to Tesla, but the  company doesn’t share that data with the public.

Recently, Musk  claimed that Full Self-Driving had not been a factor in any Tesla crash,  although at least eight crash reports submitted by Tesla owners to  federal safety regulators [indicate otherwise](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-07-14/elon-musk-said-no-self-driving-tesla-had-ever-crashed).

Tesla’s  response to the DMV complaints, if any, has not yet been made public.  Tesla has no media relations office. Musk did not respond to an  invitation to tell Tesla’s side of the story.",California DMV accuses Tesla of falsely advertising Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features,1.0,2022-08-05 20:27:00

930,1659711181,wgxhu8,1," Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world’s most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.

In a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company’s proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.

Tesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today’s closing price the new share price would be around $308.

Though the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don’t impact a company’s market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.

Tesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla’s 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.

Several other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet’s split 20:1 in February and Amazon’s stock split 20:1 split one month later.

931,1659708637,wgwh9l,1,"Elon Musk took aim at a rival automaker – and his own efforts to curb what he calls the global underpopulation crisis – with a tweet that had his followers in splits.

Musk aimed his dig at Lucid Motors, an American electric vehicle manufacturer that announced its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday. The EV maker delivered just 679 cars in the second quarter of 2022 – a fact that prompted the CEO of Tesla to joke he had had more children in the same time period.

“I had more kids in Q2 than they made cars!” Elon Musk quipped in response to a tweet on Lucid Motors’ performance in quarter two.

Musk’s own contribution to the world population aside (the tech billionaire has nine children), his company Tesla also outperformed Lucid in terms of vehicle deliveries. According to Tesla’s website, the electric automaker “produced over 258,000 vehicles and delivered over 254,000 vehicles” to Lucid Motors’ 679 cars. This, Tesla says, is “despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns”.

958,1659448715,weceds,1," Twitter Inc. subpoenaed records from Morgan Stanley and other financial firms as part of its legal fight with Elon Musk over his canceled $44 billion acquisition of the social media platform.

Morgan Stanley was Musk’s chief financial adviser on the proposed deal and pledged up to $5.5 billion in financing. In a series of subpoenas posted Monday in Delaware Chancery Court, Twitter also sought documents from Bank of America, Barclays PLC, BNP Paribas, Citigroup Inc. and several other banks that committed to backing Musk’s acquisition.

The pre-trial request for information seek a wide range of communications and documents about Musk’s bid to acquire Twitter for $54.20 a share, which he nixed over claims that the company failed to provide him with information about spam and bot accounts.

Among the documents sought are those relating to Musk’s initial plans to partially fund his Twitter purchase with a margin loan tied to his Tesla Inc stake. In May, Musk dropped the margin loan and provided additional equity financing.

Twitter itself was advised on the deal by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

In its suit seeking to compel Musk to complete the acquisition, Twitter argues that the world’s richest person is using his bot account claims as a pretext to walk away from the deal.

Delaware Chancery Court judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick has scheduled a five-day trial starting on Oct. 17.

On Friday, Musk’s lawyers filed an answer to Twitter’s suit under seal.

[Press release](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-four-one-stock-split)

So the way it should work the transfer agent of Gamestop (Computershare) creates 3 new shares for every existing share. Then they give the dividend of 3 new shares per every old share to all the shares that are directly registered with them and give the remaining shares to the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) that should take care of distributing the shares to the brokers, who have the shares in the street name aka fugazis (no broker has any stock certificates, all US stock certifactes that are not directly registered with the company's transfer agent are held on behalf of the DTCC by Cede&amp;Co.).

The DTCC should have a record of the number of shares that belong to the depositories (subsidiary of the DTCC in the US, Clearstream in the EU), so they should distribute the stock dividend they got from Computershare to the Depositories, and the Depositories should to the same to Clearing Brokers, which should do the same to the Brokers.

&amp;#x200B;

We now have plenty of evidence that this is not what happened, and instead after receiving the stock dividend the DTCC just told all the depositories to treat it like a regular stock split (multiple all the fugazis by four).

It first came to light when the German clearing broker DWP Bank decided to reverse the stock split and correctly issue a stock dividend. This caused German shareholders to temporarily lose 3/4 of their shares. Some have it back already, some brokers using DWP Bank as their clearing broker still didn't issue the stock dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

So if this isn't the smoking gun I don't know what is. The DTCC received the Stock Dividend from Computershare and instead of distributing it they ignored it and told everyone to just make it a normal stock split.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For many people it is an important distinction because of:

1. Tax implications
2. People who registered their shares between the date of record and the ex-dividend date got no dividend or split, they're down 75%
3. MOASS theory

So firstly in most countries a stock dividend would be a taxable event, so for the shareholders it's good that it wasn't accounted as a stock dividend, but shouldn't various tax agencies around the world care?

Secondly, there's plenty of people who decided to DRS just before or after the date of record and their broker has send their shares to Computershare between the date of record and the ex-dividend date. That means that the broker should receive the Stock Dividend and forward it to Computershare. Instead all the brokers claim that the ex-dividend date doesn't matter, and since the shares were on Computershare on the ex-dividend date it's computershare that's responsible for the dividend (or rather multiplying the shares x4, IDK why the brokers called it a dividend here when DTCC says it's a stock split). Why the hell do we have a date of record at all then?? Both Computershare and brokers stand firm and those people are SOOL and lost 3/4 of their shares.

Thirdly, many people, me included, think that the whole debacle proves that the amount of synthetic shares from naked shorting, be it illegal naked shorting or market maker privilege, makes it impossible for the DTCC to distribute the stock dividend without trigerring MOASS (because there's not enough dividend shares for the synthetic shares, so that would trigger a mandatory buyback)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I think this is time for legal action. I think first in-line should be the people who did not receive their dividend and didn't get their shares split, because Computershare got their shares after the date of record. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know how should those people proceed. Should they all individually sue their broker? Should they pursue class-action suits against their respective brokers? Should they sue the DTCC? Should Gamestop sue the DTCC?",What happened to the Gamestop splividend and why no MOASS,1.0,2022-08-01 20:08:51

[Fidelity confirming the DTCC is treating it as a stock split](https://preview.redd.it/ehwlvwjzo5f91.jpg?width=494&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2548a231c3f3fb4777d3938794e90d9b2cfedcdf)

&amp;#x200B;

For many people it is an important distinction because of:

1. Tax implications
2. People who registered their shares between the date of record and the ex-dividend date got no dividend or split, they're down 75%
3. MOASS theory

So firstly in most countries a stock dividend would be a taxable event, so for the shareholders it's good that it wasn't accounted as a stock dividend, but shouldn't various tax agencies around the world care?

Secondly, there's plenty of people who decided to DRS just before or after the date of record and their broker has send their shares to Computershare between the date of record and the ex-dividend date. That means that the broker should receive the Stock Dividend and forward it to Computershare. Instead all the brokers claim that the ex-dividend date doesn't matter, and since the shares were on Computershare on the ex-dividend date it's computershare that's responsible for the dividend (or rather multiplying the shares x4, IDK why the brokers called it a dividend here when DTCC says it's a stock split). Why the hell do we have a date of record at all then?? Both Computershare and brokers stand firm and those people are SOOL and lost 3/4 of their shares.

Thirdly, many people, me included, think that the whole debacle proves that the amount of synthetic shares from naked shorting, be it illegal naked shorting or market maker privilege, makes it impossible for the DTCC to distribute the stock dividend without trigerring MOASS (because there's not enough dividend shares for the synthetic shares, so that would trigger a mandatory buyback)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? I think this is time for legal action. I think first in-line should be the people who did not receive their dividend and didn't get their shares split, because Computershare got their shares after the date of record. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know how should those people proceed. Should they all individually sue their broker? Should they pursue class-action suits against their respective brokers? Should they sue the DTCC? Should Gamestop sue the DTCC?",What happened to the Gamestop splividend/why no MOASS,1.0,2022-08-01 19:59:45

Elon Musk’s Antics Turn Owners and Would-Be Buyers Against Tesla     

Ira Boudway and Kyle Stock           

Sat, July 30, 2022 at 9:00 AM           

(Bloomberg) -- Dennis Levitt got his first Tesla, a blue Model S, in 2013, and loved it. “It was so much better than any car I've ever driven,” the 73-year-old self-storage company executive says.        

He bought into the brand as well as Elon Musk, Tesla Inc.’s charismatic chief executive officer, purchasing another Model S the following year and driving the first one across the country. In 2016, he stood in line at a showroom near his suburban Los Angeles home to be one of the first to order two Model 3s — one for himself, the other for his wife.

“I was a total Musk fanboy,” Levitt says.

Was, because while Levitt still loves his Teslas, he’s soured on Musk. “Over time, his public statements have really come to bother me,” Levitt said, citing the CEO’s spats with US President Joe Biden, among others. “He acts like a seven-year-old.”

Before it was reported Musk had an affair with Sergey Brin’s wife, which he’s denied; before his slipshod deal, then no-deal, to acquire Twitter Inc.; before the revelation he fathered twins with an executive at his brain-interface startup Neuralink; before SpaceX fired employees who called him “a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment”; before his daughter changed her name and legal gender after his history of mocking pronouns; before an article said SpaceX paid an employee $250,000 to settle a claim he sexually harassed her, allegations he’s called untrue; Musk’s behavior was putting off prospective customers and perturbing some Tesla owners.

The trends have shown up in one consumer survey and market research report after another: Tesla commands high brand awareness, consideration and loyalty, and customers are mostly delighted by its cars. Musk’s antics, on the other hand? They could do without.

Creative Strategies, a California-based customer-experience measurer, mentioned owner frustration with Musk in a study it published in April. A year earlier, research firm Escalent found Musk was the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand among electric-vehicle owners surveyed.

“We hear from Tesla owners who will say, ‘Look, I love my vehicle, but I really wish I didn't have to respond to my friends and family about his latest tweet,’” says Mike Dovorany, who spoke with thousands of EV owners and potential buyers during his two years working in Escalent’s automotive and mobility group.

Tesla has so far had no trouble growing its way through Musk’s many controversies. The dip in vehicle deliveries the company reported last quarter was its first sequential decline since early 2020 and largely had to do with Covid lockdowns in Shanghai forcing its most productive factory to shut for weeks. Competitors that have been chasing the company for a decade may still be years away from catching up in the EV sales ranks.

Musk’s star power, built in no small part by his activity on Twitter — the same forum where he’s become such a lightning rod — has contributed immensely to Tesla, especially since it’s shunned traditional advertising. His steady stream of online banter, punctuated with the occasional grandiose announcement or stunt (see: shooting a Roadster into space) keeps Tesla in the headlines. During the company’s earlier days, the trolling and glib comments were a feature, not a bug. They allowed Musk to shape media coverage and made him the ringleader for Tesla’s legion of very-online fans.

But after making Tesla and himself so synonymous with one another, Musk has waded into political conflicts, attempted to buy one of the world’s most influential social media platforms and struggled to bat back unflattering coverage of his personal life, putting the company’s increasingly valuable brand at risk.

Jerry James Stone, a 48-year-old chef in Sacramento, California, who teaches his 219,000 YouTube channel subscribers how to make vegan and vegetarian meals, drives a Volkswagen Beetle convertible and plans to go electric with his next car. He isn’t sure yet which model, but certain it won’t be a Tesla.

“Elon has just soiled that brand for me so much that I don't even think I would take one if I won one,” Stone says. “You have this guy who's the richest dude in the world, who has this huge megaphone, and he uses it to call somebody a pedophile who's not, or to fat-shame people, all these things that are just kind of gross.”

According to Strategic Vision, a US research firm that consults auto companies, some 39% of car buyers say they wouldn’t consider a Tesla. That’s not necessarily out of the ordinary — almost half of respondents say they won’t consider German luxury brands. But Tesla does lag more mass-market brands: Toyota, for example, is only off the shopping list for 23% of drivers.

Emma Sirr, a 28-year-old worker in cloud computing who lives in Bozeman, Montana, gets around with her partner and their two dogs in a 2004 Nissan Frontier. They've been researching EVs for about three years and until recently considered Teslas the only viable option, given their range and the charging infrastructure the company has built in their area. But they refused to buy one because of Musk, their main gripes being his politics, staff turnover at the company and its cavalier approach to autonomous-driving technology.

“We took Tesla off the table from the get-go,” Sirr says. She and her partner have their eyes on the Kia Niro and Chevrolet Bolt as possible alternatives. “As consumers, our power is what we buy. I think younger generations in particular vote with their wallets, and I feel like that might come back to bite.”

For much of the past decade, Tesla lacked competitors that matched its models’ battery range and other measures of performance. Consumers put off by Musk’s mischief had few EVs to turn to. As legacy automakers introduce more capable electric models, Tesla won’t have as much leeway.

“We've seen among the early adopters more of a willingness to take risks or to put up with things that are out of the ordinary,” says Dovorany, who left Escalent for an automotive tech startup earlier this year. “We're not seeing that as much with incoming buyers.” To win this cohort, automakers need to check every box, and for some, that includes employing a CEO who doesn’t share Hilter memes on social media.

Levitt, the self-described former Musk fanboy, took a test ride last month in a Lucid. He wasn’t sold on it, partly he says because it didn’t have enough cargo space for his golf gear. He’s still waiting for another automaker to steal him away from Tesla and considering models from Audi, Mercedes and BMW.

“If you take Mr. Musk and his antics out of the equation, I'm about 98% certain that my next car would be a Tesla,” Levitt says. “His antics put me in play.”",$TSLA | Elon Musk’s Antics Turn Owners and Would-Be Buyers Against Tesla,1.0,2022-07-30 18:48:57

Tesla is finally planning to launch Cloud-based profiles in its new 2022.24 Software Update, according to release notes obtained by *NotATeslaApp.*

Tesla will officially label the feature “Tesla Profiles,” **according to the report**, which also detailed a new feature that will allow drivers to control where the **Blind Spot Camera feed will be presented on the center screen**.

For years, Tesla has talked about launching driver profiles that would allow cars that have multiple drivers, are rentals, or are utilized in a car-sharing service to give profiles to each person driving the car.

In November, the possibility took a drastic step forward when it was also reported by ***Not A Tesla App*** that Tesla was working on Cloud Profiles and that it would be geared toward multiple-Tesla owners or rentals, so profiles would transfer from vehicle to vehicle:

Things such as mirrors, seats, and wheels can be adjusted and synced to a specific driver’s profile so that, when they get into another Tesla vehicle, the settings will automatically adjust those things in the exact position the driver wants.

The advantage also spreads to those who rent Teslas and drive different vehicles more often than not. One week, a driver may be renting a Model 3 in Las Vegas, and will be able to set the seat, mirrors, and steering wheel to specific orientations. When they rent a Model X in Montreal the following month, those exact positions will be automatically adjusted by the Cloud Profile.

CEO Elon Musk has talked about the feature since 2017.

Tesla’s 2019 Autonomy Day event showed that Musk was still serious about the feature, as he ensured those who will utilize the Robotaxi Network would have full convenience to manage their fleet.",‘Tesla Profiles’ brings cloud-based convenience to drivers,1.0,2022-07-29 22:59:26

There aren't many people, let alone investors, who wouldn't have wanted to get into Tesla (TSLA) a decade ago or even a few years ago, while market analysts and the conventional wisdom was that they'll be close to bankrupt and not be able to sell the amount of electric vehicles they are selling today.

I believe that Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) is one of those candidates for 2022. There certainly are hurdles the company will face, most notably the established presence of companies like Tesla and other automobile companies, some of which have opened their first manufacturing plant over 100 years ago.

But given the fact that the company has reached a deal with Foxconn (OTCPK:FXCOF) to help with raising capital for mass production of their flagship light pickup truck the Endurance - the prospects of the company meeting their already slimmed down delivery estimates is relatively high, and thus I believe the company's potential is vast relative to its current valuation.

What's The Deal?

The premise here is quite simple. Market experts expect the electric pickup truck market to sell around 25,000 vehicles in 2022, dominated by the likes of the Ford (F) F-150 Lightning. But by 2030, the same market analysis calls for there being a demand for about 1 million electric pickup trucks, a 40-fold increase over the span of about 8 years.

My belief is that with the help of Foxconn, as well as them focusing solely on the pickup truck model without venturing into places unknown - they'll be able to 'pick up' quite a decent market share of that 1 million vehicle demand as they ramp up production.

Expectations Are Conservative, Valuation More So

Right now, the company expects to deliver about 500 vehicles in 2022, significantly down from their initial expectations when announced back in June of 2021. This is a result of supply chain issues which have plagued all automobile manufacturers as a result of ports closing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts and company projections are calling for 2,500 deliveries in 2023, followed by around 10,000 in 2024.

With a starting price of $52,500 per car, which is on the conservative side since most people who are spending that much on a pickup truck are likely going to go for upgrades, as we've seen with Tesla cars and others. This brings the following revenue projections for the next 3 years, where I assume a $2,500 reduction in price each year to account for efficiency, as stated by the company:

Year	Deliveries	Unit Cost	Exp. Revenue
2022	500	$52,500	$26.3 million
2023	2500	$50,000	$125 million
2024	10000	$47,500	$475 million
(Source: Company expectations / Author calculations)

For the following years, assuming an ~8% market share through 2030 means that the company will have the potential to deliver just shy of 80,000 vehicles a year in 2030, which with an average price of around $50,000 comes out to about $4.5 billion in revenue per year. This is assuming the company does not launch any other vehicles throughout that time period, an assessment which I believe is silly but for the purpose of this investment thesis I will assume.

Before heading in to discuss valuation, which is the reason we're all here today, it's worth noting that these expectations and assessments are not without risk, and significant risks at that, given how crowded the electric vehicle market is.

Reasons To Worry

There are several reasons to worry about the prospects of success, most notably from competitive pressures like I mentioned earlier in the article from established automobile manufacturers who are already introducing new all-electric vehicles - including Ford with their F-150 Lightning which is the closest rival to the company's purposed Endurance light pickup truck.

The second reason to worry is cash. The company started off strong with around $630 million after its IPO but then has been using that cash to ramp up hiring and manufacturing plans and now only holds $204 million in cash. This can potentially be enough for them to get started as we await money coming from potential pre-orders and other investment in the company but there is a risk that they won't be able to effectively scale up production, even if demand if high.

There's a third, albeit less significant risk associated with geopolitical pressures which has been proven in the past to be important: tax credits. From administration to administration in the United States, the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles have been in and out of style and although this credit never stopped those who went for either the expensive Tesla cars or the more economical cheap versions, they do have an impact on the transition to all-electric vehicles for those contemplating a new vehicle purchase, given the higher cost. With an elimination of a $7,500 tax credit, the pickup truck categories can be hurt quite significantly, especially with the lower-cost F-150 Lightning and what's sure to be additional makes and model on the market by that point in time in 2025, 2029 or beyond.

Valuation Presents Immense Opportunity

The beauty of my belief in the company is that it's, for now, solely based on the Endurance sales and not on any future vehicles they may launch with or without Foxconn, which means the likelihood of them outperforming these 2030 expectations are quite high, giving us room for error if sales of the Endurance alone fall short.

Most automobile companies like Ford are currently trading at around a 0.3x multiple of price to sales. I'm using price to sales multiples since it's difficult to determine what the company's profit structure will look like moving forward given the complexities of ownership with Foxconn.

Although currently the company's price/sales ratio is high, around 4x for 2023, the exponential growth is justifying such a high valuation, given the comparative growth relative to companies like Ford. However, the company is currently trading at around 0.1x price to sales once it reaches the $4.5 billion in sales sometime before 2030.

This means that, in a conservative estimate, the company has the potential to be fairly valued at around 3x its current valuation, or around $6.00 per share.

Conclusion: Risky, But Worth It

There certainly are much higher risks associated with Lordstown Motors than traditional automobile companies, as well as the overall. But given that they are only now beginning to ramp up production with the new Foxconn deal, it's evident that their current price is not justified and should be trading quite a bit higher.

With a 300% potential return over the next 8 years, I believe that Lordstown Motors will easily outperform other established automobile manufacturers as well as the overall market, which is why I am highly bullish on the company's long-term prospects.",Lordstown Motors: Getting In Before the Surge,1.0,2022-07-29 20:15:03

**Disclaimer :** If you are coming here in search for stock tips you ain't getting any of that here. Instead what you will be getting is general piece of advice regarding the “Stock Market '' as whole through this fictional story that I'm about to share with you. So If you guys are busy and don't have much time then i advise you to just skip this post. This post is just not for you. I won't mind at all honestly. So without any further due. Let us begin.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Hello Everyone,**

**Respected Traders and Investors** 

Long time no see. As you all know, I have been kicked out of my mom’s house. But I never told you guys the reason why. The thing that I'm about to tell you is kinda shocking and a secret. So promise me that you won't tell anybody. I'm counting on you guys that this stays b/w us.

&amp;#x200B;

[Depressionary books of all time](https://preview.redd.it/jan3dd6jsbe91.png?width=1801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac4eff6f83fff001c6ed9ee87928000927aef8d7)

&amp;#x200B;

As you all know I'm kinda a massive bear in the stock market thinking the world is about to go into a forgotten depression ( if not Great Depression. 95 yr of cycle ) which would be written in some book about after we complete this fourth turning. Whether its ""Stagflationary"" or ""Deflationary"" one remains the case to be seen. But currently the market is projecting it to be deflationary one. So I don't wanna hear any complaints from any of you that you weren't able to buy long term bonds with hedge funds last month. No complaints. Period. I gave you the date and you just had to buy it b//w May 15-June 15. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So moving forward. Since i’m so bearish i wanted to go meet somebody who is just the polar opposite of me being pessimist bear. The man had to be someone who had been investing in the high inflation kind of environment and who outperformed the market when the market rebounded sharply from being a bear market to bull market. Yes my friends i built a time machine in my mom's basement. xD

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Finding the period.](https://preview.redd.it/lzec8747tbe91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856c794c85c0702d8577960ff8a64a7bd1635b74)

&amp;#x200B;

This type of scenario happened in 1920-21, 1948-50, 1975-1976. Since my machine cannot go so far into the past because it would consume a lot of electricity and power. I just don't wanna pay high energy prices. I am also quite worried about a global energy crisis so I thought why not cut my trip short and meet anyone from 1970's stagflation. The second half of the 70's decade when the market began to turn. I wanted to meet someone who beat the market during this time. This man is someone you must have read stories about from your ancestors, associates or probably in the books. This man is none another than “Peter Lynch” His fund Magellan outperformed the market during the second half period of stagflation when market rebounded. The other guy who was a close second during this time was Warren Buffet but he is still alive and we can track his investments if we ever wanna know how to invest in a bear market. “Just buy Oil stocks'' he says” But if you do your own research you would know he was the winner in the first half of the 70's decade. So in general he was good too. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So i was building this time machine that will let me travel in the past to meet my man Peter Lynch. Once the machine worked successfully I wasted no time jumping right in and reached the period after the turmoil had long been over somewhere b/w 1991-92. It was a cold rainy night. He just came back to his home after working late hours in the office. At first i hesitated thinking what his reaction would be but then i thought f%#k it. Let’s just ring the doorbell. Then came the footsteps approaching and there he was the man himself, whom I admire the most. I just don’t know why I was shaking a lot. So as he came by i immediately greeted him at first and said “Hello sir”. I have come from the future of 2022 and I wanted some help regarding the investing world. The man didn't even flinch and said “Huh, Okay”. It was like he knew that one day people from the future would invent a time machine or he just thinks that maybe i'm the guy from the work who has lost his minds spending hours finding the stocks. So then he said sure I will give you my two hrs to help you get educated about the principles of stock market w/o taking your millions of dollars. I was so happy and excited that now I will be able to beat the market and make a name for myself in ""Wall street"". As I was going through the house I realized that there was no one in the house which kinda felt strange at first but then later when we sat down it all felt comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

 

[A conversation with the man himself.](https://preview.redd.it/unzsiwhzube91.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42acf2639d354ea221d07e2eb1d2bf9cbb89215c)

&amp;#x200B;

So here’s the conversation that took place b/w me a reddit noob of ""Wallstreetbets"" and the man who beat the market in the later half of the 70's decade when the market rebounded.

( Me = Wall street Noob , Peter = The great “Peter Lynch” )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir, do you know it's pleasure to meet you in person. I’m a huge fan of you and so are the many of the investors in Wall street corporate america.

**Peter :** Well thank you. Glad to hear but hey please don't tell me about the future as it could mess with the timelines. Haha.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sure. Do you know what sir? We have a community which is kinda like the community in the physical realm where we take down large corporations by making bets. Kinda like David vs goliath.

**Peter :** Oh really that sounds cool. It looks like people in the future are really not afraid of investing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Well sir right now everyone is. We all are realizing that it is a hard game. Not for everyone. The only thing we guys do is post our losses on reddit and brag about it.

**Peter :** What so fun bragging about your losses. Don't you guys wanna make money?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Well sir it's complicated. You wouldn't understand,

**Peter :** Do you even know who i am?

 

**Me :**  Sorry sir. I didn't mean it that way.

**Peter :** \*\* Uff what a loser. Okay. Shall we start?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Silently  Yes.

**Peter :** Lemme ask you a simple question. What kind of stock do you own? And the reason why?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Well sir i used to own these what i called Voldemort asset class kind of stocks because they went up so much. I think they will go up again in 2024-25 due to the halving cycle associated with them. This type of stocks would have place in the so called ""Metaverse"" which would be a place in digital world. What about you sir. What kind of stocks do you own?

**Peter :** Well I own this company. They make a relatively mundane product. It’s a one megabit, S-ram, Cmos, Bipolar risk, Floating point data I/o array processor with optimizing compiler, 16-bit dual port memory with Unix operating system, 4 whetstone mega flop polysillicon emitter with high bandwidth. It’s really important. 6-Ghz double metallization communication protocol, asynchronous backward compatibility, peripheral bus architecture, four wave interleave memory token ring interchangeable back plane. And this all happens in 15 nanosecond of capability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Wow sir. It must be really good stock. It might definitely go up.

**Peter :** Well if you buy companies like this kind of story. It is owning sh9t tbh. It will never make money. So shall you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Huh, why.

**Peter :** Well what would you do if your stock goes from 69 to 9. Will you buy more or walk around the block and call your friends.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir it already is. All these stocks are down like 70%+. xD

**Peter :** That is the problem. Look man. I buy stocks like Dunkin Donuts, Stop and Shop, CBS, Sallie Mae. Do you know this Sallie Mae is kinda interesting. Not many people look at it. Imagine loaning money to students and no one looked at it. These are the kind of stuff i buy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Oh i see. You mean sir find the **hidden stock that no-one is looking at which has nice and simple business.** Easy to understand. Got it.

**Peter :** You say right now you will but I know you won’t do this. Because you don’t wanna know the story of the stock.

 

**Me :** Sir I will. Trust me. By the way sir i always wanna ask you a way to predict how high the Fed funds rate will go. I mean what technicals do you guys look at? Do I have to watch dot plots and forward guidance by the Fed and do some integral calculations to calculate recession.

**Peter :** What's wrong with you? No. **Stop trying to calculate when the recession is going to happen or when the stock market will go up/down or how high the interest rates would go.** Tbh, I would love to get next year's wall street journal. But you just don't.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir I can get it for you. I have this machine. Oh sh9t sorry sir. I only have fuel for one journey.

**Peter :** God. Why do you wanna mess with timelines? Anyway, I remember in 1982 we had a 20% prime rate, 15% government bonds, double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. I don't remember anyone telling me about that in 1980 they did though in 1981. But in 1983 I remember they said well the economy bounced back well but we will have a recession 85. In 85 they said recession 86. Something happened in 87 October. Everyone lost like 7 figures. Something bad happened. Then they said sure recession 88 and then they said 89 for sure recession and then in 90 we were supposed to have this so called soft landing which we never had. So in general I always tell this to others. **If you spend 13 minutes in economics you have wasted 10 minutes.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Don't worry about me sir. I never even attended a business school. Haha.

**Peter :** Look, all you wanna about the stock **market is it goes up and goes down. Sometimes it goes down a lot.** It’s good to know what's gonna happen with the economy but **I deal with facts.** If inventories are going back, if copper prices are going down, if room occupancy is going the wrong way, people are building too many hotels. I look at freight cars holdings, railroad stocks. I deal with facts. **I don't deal with people telling me something's gonna happen in future.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir but i can predict and i have been right so far.

**Peter :** Do you have a psychic line or something? You don't really get it. Do you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** I don't know. 

**Peter :** Well look you have got plenty of time. Right? Why are you in a rush to buy a stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir because whenever i go on fancy dates. The girl asks me my net worth. So i just say i'm waiting for the right moment. 

**Peter :** Oh God. Look man. **You could have bought Walmart 10 yrs after it went public you would have made 30 times your money**. Just so because you waited. Why cant they be in 15 or 18 or lets say 26% of the entire Usa.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir now its just at every state except one.

**Peter :** That’s not the point. The point is you have plenty of time in this business.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir i’m quite confused. I get scared sometimes from stocks. Hence I advised my people on Wall street bets to get bonds. At least they would make above 3%. But sir they called me chicken little.

**Peter :** Look man there is nothing to be scared of stocks. Lemme give you 10 most basic dangerous things about stocks. By knowing them already you would not get scared later on.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. “It’s gone down already it cannot go much lower”**

There was a stock called Polaroid. It went from 140 to 107. People said if it goes under 100 just back up the truck. Eventually it broke 100 and went to 18 in nine months.

I had an experience one time with Kaiser in Fidelity. We were gonna buy the biggest block ever in history 10-15M shares. Stock had gone from 29 to 17. I called my mom and asked how much lower it could go. Then it went to 10, 9 and to 7, 6 , 5 , 4. Fortunately this happened rapidly otherwise I would have been working at Stop and See. This all happened in 6 months. I was a little early at 15 and 3 quarters as my avg price. We call this premature in business. Had a correction which you know is a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly. Then again did an analysis. They own a lot of things steel, aluminium, cable etc. Funny thing is they had no debt. No one has ever gone bankrupt w/o debt. So i thought it wont go to 0. But they did. So they sold all businesses and gave back the shares. Eventually they were then sold to some company for $55/share. I also saw Taco bell go from 14 to 1 in 1974. They too had no debt and making 60c/share.

So never say the stock can’t go any lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*In my mind. Hmm, I will buy Microsoft and Apple at $1 someday. Sir what are the other 9 i wanna know more.

**Peter :** Well here’s the corollary to the above one. 

&amp;#x200B;

**“It’s gone high already, how could it possibly go any higher”**

So Philips Morris was a stock that was adjusted for splits. Sold for 12c in 1951. Then it went to 60c in 1961. So everybody was wondering how high it could go. It has already gone 5x. These experts of the markets underestimated the power of Marlboro. They missed that there are 220 countries in the world. They missed cash flow. They missed everything. This stock was 100 bagger after going up 5x. But people sold it just because they thought how much higher it could go. They did the same with home depot, I did the same with ToysRuz. 

So just don't this okay. It’s a very bad thing and dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Here's another one that sucks. “Eventually they always come back”**

Rca just about to get back to its 1929 price was backed out by G. Manville never came back. International harvester even with its name changed and adjusted for splits doesn't get all.way back. Western Union, Double Knits ( floppy disks ) These stocks don't have to come back. But people say they will eventually come back. This is all not true.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Wooah sir. That is too much to process. Can you slow it down a bit.

**Peter :** Can you just keep it up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Hmm Did i underestimate Tesla by selling at $1000+ and used the cash for buying Nio to recover to its original price.

**Peter :** \*\* I know this guy doesn't get anything. Well here's another one for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. ""Suppose you buy a stock at $3 how much can you lose""**

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Obviously $3.

**Peter :** Okay so tell me suppose your neighbour bought $10,000 worth of stock at price $50. And the stock is now at $3. You put $25000 at the price $3. If it goes to 0 who loses the most.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir, wait a sec. Can I use this calculator lying on the desk.

**Peter :** God why do you need a calculator? Just think logically.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Ahh. I think my neighbour.

**Peter :** God you're stupid. Just figure out this on your way home. Here’s another one and better start writing these all points down.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. ""It’s always darkest before the dawn"" ""Business is awful terrible""** 

Here’s this one you will be talking  before lunch. Freight car deliveries. In 1979 there was 96,000 freight cars in USA. Two yrs later. It fell to 45,000. The lowest in 23 yrs. From 96 to 45 thousand. People always say business is horrible pathetic. Then it falls to 25,000. They say just load up. There’s about 15 opportunities to lose money. There’s about 15 supplier of freight cars and 15 manufacturers. Then last year we shipped 7000 freight cars. Business now was continuing to get miserable.

There is a great opportunity to lose money in energy services industry. In 1982 there were 11,000 oil rigs drilling holes in Okhloma, Texas, Colorado. We used to recount them every week. Rig count fell from 11,000 in 1982 to 6,000 in 1983. And then some more in 1984. There’s hundreds of companies here. Mud, down hole, fracturing companies, Well companies. All measuring companies the chambers the bid companies. Lots and lots of opportunities to lose money here. Also equal opportunities for serious losses. People always say business is terrible. Lets buy these groups. The rig count was now 1000 three yrs ago.

**So just saying business cant get any worse. It can always do more.** Once upon a time i had a textile industry in addition to metals. You then follow companies like JP Stevens, West roll pepper which were founded in 18th century. Burlington is new one which was founded in 1904. These people have been through recession, depression , world war. They have seen it all. There is a great expression in Texas industry. 

**It’s always darkest before pitch black.**

So remember if business is terrible it can always go terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Tech is doomed. Every thing is going to 0. Sir more more.

**Peter :** Yah yah.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. “When it rebounds to 10 i will sell""**

Well you see this stocks went to 4 and people think it goes to 10 they will sell. So if they are really that confident shouldn't you buy more. That's like 66% return. But they think nope. They will sell. What you ought see never put down a round number. Stock will always go to 7 or 9. Never to 10.

The first first rule you need to know here is : **Stock does not know you own it**. Doesn't matter how bad of a person you are with 69 spouses. If you own Coke for last 50 yrs the stock has gone 300x. You could be national hero, give donations, help cure cancer or aids but if you own Bethlehem steel. The stock is lower than it was 30 yrs ago.

So its not your fault. Don't take this personally. But people treat stock like grandchildren or puppy. They think stock knows who you are.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. ""I own conservative stocks, i don't have to worry""**

Public service Indiana went down 90%. Gulf state Indiana, long on lighting. This is oxymoron we own quality Texas banks that went to 0. We had quality new England banks that went to 0. These are companies that have been around 120-150 yrs.

Lot of people don't inherit a stock from somebody. They’ll say my mother said on deathbed. Don't sell the long island lightning. These so called conservative stocks like Eastman Kodak fell 75%, Ibm fell 75%.

**Don't tell anybody you own conservative stock. Companies are very dynamic.**

&amp;#x200B;

**7. ""Look at all the money I’ve lost because i didn't buy it""**

People say this all the time. I didn't own blockbuster, home depot. Even i myself made a list of some 200 stocks that went 100x that i didn't own. But people always worry about missing Microsoft, western digital, united airlines. People always worry about these kind of things. 

**So remember. You cannot lose money in stocks if you don't own it. The only way to lose money in stock market is you buy stock, it goes down and you press sell button. This is the only way.**

I swear people spouse cut newspaper in morning and there they say i was gonna buy Microsoft when it was at 3. I lost 3000 in Microsoft last night while i was sleeping. I was gonna buy 17000 shares of semiconductor at 10. Its now at 17. I lost 49000 on national semiconductor.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. ""I will miss this one but i will catch the next one""**

This usually does not work. There’s a lot of copycats of Toysrus there’s trial world. There was lionel. There’s copycats of home depot. **Buying a next of something doesn't work.** It’s really bad. It’s like buying on dips. Better way is to buy from dips.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. ""Stock has gone up i must be right. Stock has gone down i must be wrong""**

I’m convinced people do this every time. They buy stock at 10 very little. It goes to now 13. They say they don't know anything more than they knew when they were at 10. It’s at 13 now. 

The best thing that could happen to them is if stock directly go from 10 to 4. But for these people it eventually will go 4 but it goes 13 in middle. They convinced now. They bought 100 shares at 10. They now buy 20,000 at 13. All the fact is stock went from 10 to 13 as it went up. 

**The average movement of stock in this century b/w its high and low has been 50%. Stock goes up and down a lot. Stock goes up means you're right doesn't mean a damn thing.**

&amp;#x200B;

**10. ""Avoid long shots""**

**This is called whisper stocks.** These stocks will grow your hair, make your kid have better spelling and your breasts can improve and you won't have to iron your pants. Its those stocks that will do everything for you. These stocks don't have any sales yet. But my god if this works its gonna be the next xerox. It’s going to help murder in space and everything. It’s very good. 

Now this is not a long shot **its a no shot.**

I have tried 30 of these and i have never broken even on a long shot. Never. I made 25 or 30 times money on stocks i never thought about like Sallie Mae or Mbia, Fannie Mae or some of the banks. Stop and shop made 20 times to 30 times of money. 

**So if you go into stocks thinking you will make 4-20 times of your money then probably that stock won't work for you. Long shot don't work.**

And if you do wanna buy them at $3 and you know its gonna do a 100x. Meaning it will go $300. So write a story down at $3 and wait a few months after it goes $13 just check whether they started doing sales yet or not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Noting everything down. Woaah sir. Thank a lot for this tips. Sir can you please tell me the other things that you look at and what all skills do i need to pick right stock

**Peter :** Look man. You will find many people in this industry telling you to look at management or be Math's Olympiad winner etc. Trust me you don't need any of that. Here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Management**

Management is a very important thing for a company. But for an outsider to differentiate b/w average, good or worst management is tough to do. You only get an hour to decide. How do you know what decisions they didn't make. A lot of good decision company made is when they didn't made an acquisition. Or they didn't get rid of division.

**So the best decision is to buy a company that any fool can run.** Like ex Toyzrus. Any fool even you can run the company. They had the right formula to begin with with no competition. What they were doing had no copycats. They were gonna steam roll for next 25 yrs. Same with circuit city. 

In the end the story should be solid. If management can add anything on top of it. Great. Don't buy a company if someone tells you it has great management. Great management is always attached to how much has stock gone up last yr. Look at Reynolds metals. The stock had same person for 30 yrs. When Aluminum was tight they say Reynolds had great management. Aluminium got oversupplied they said these people are idiots Aluminium gets tight again they say people are terrific. All it had to do was with the stock price. And they kept writing how it had great management with how stocks were doing. So again **it's very hard to measure management.** If you get a chance to see them in action for 1-2m then sure. But you don't get that kind of chance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*I’m so gonna get rekt in Coinbase. The guys in All in podcast told me Brian Armstrong have excellent control of management. Sir do tell more.

**Peter :** Well another thing is

&amp;#x200B;

**- Be Flexible**

People have these biases or prejudices that they won't buy high growth companies, they will say no to financials, they won't buy savings and loans, they won't buy companies with letter R. So don't cut yourself to just one segment.

&amp;#x200B;

Another important thing is 

**- Math :**

I was very good at math's till multiplying and then calculating speed distances all sorts of stuff. But then they introduced cosine one day. Then came tangent, cotangent and area under the curve with some integral calculus. This is all garbage seriously for the stock market. You don't need this all kind of stuff for picking stocks. But for some reason Hedge funds and institutions guys do. **If you can just add 8+8 and get answer close to 16. That's all you need in the stock market.**

&amp;#x200B;

400M in debt, no cash, no equity and company losing money = bad stock. Forget it.

300M in cash, no debt, 200M in net worth, they are losing 10M on a quarter = they will be around.

If you passed 5th grade you will make it in this field. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** So sir you're saying if i go and barge Fidelity, Bridge Water or Black rock doorsteps tomorrow. They will sign me up for the job just because i can do 3rd grade maths.

**Peter :** Well they should.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Yes. If this Wsb post didn’t work out. I’m going there tomorrow.

**Peter :** \*\*I hope he gets kicked out of the door at Fidelity. Well moving on here’s another most important thing to know about.

&amp;#x200B;

**- “There’s always something to worry about”**

Look, the thing is everybody has got the brainpower to do well in the stock market. The Question is whether you **have the stomach for it.** That’s the key organ. There’s always something to worry about. I grew up as a kid in their 50's. In the decade of the 50's there’s a big theory that depression was caused by the stock market crash. Totally wrong.

Less than 1% of American owned stock in 1929. We had this big time depression. It wasn't caused by the stock market. It was that the economy went down and the Fed raised rates and we had a big time depression. In fact we had several depressions from 1850 on. But people thought the only reason we got depression was World war 2 and they said once we get back next time if a recession comes then that recession will turn into depression. And its gonna be “Great Depression” I never understood this adjective before Depression. Like there could be ""Crummy depression"" or ""Bad depression"" too. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Great Depression](https://preview.redd.it/i6e10fpqgce91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae4040118dc33f90f4245ff9fc6a38e76d525fae)

&amp;#x200B;

**So people weren’t buying stocks in 50's because they thought another “Great Depression” was going to happen.** In addition people were very scared about nuclear warheads and war in the 1950's. People were building fallout shelters, stocking mccan goods. There’s something about going into Vermont and building a fallout shelter putting canned goods in it that you don't buy at Minnesota mining. Your’e buying lots of water, shotguns, buying frozen food that will stay in freezer with your own generator. And you’re looking at growth stocks. It doesn't seem to work out that way. I remember in my class in 1950's. Someone would come over and blew whistle and you get under your desk. I thought at that time it wont do us any good. But people were worried about nuclear war and depression in 1950's. The war heads couldn't do that damage in 1950's. But everyone was like they could blow up the entire world. We now stopped worrying all about this. 

The 50's in my opinion was best decade of the century except for the 80's. Slightly better. People didn't expect a lot. It was just okay. We made it through and stock market was terrific. You know there was a time oil went from 4 to 40 and expert said they would go to 100 and all countries in world would go bankrupt. And then big banks go bankrupt and we are gonna have “Great Depression” and stock market would go down and you wind up selling pencils and apples. The Oil went from 4 to 40 and expert said it will go 100 but then 2 yrs later it went to 14. The expert now much higher paid at this point are saying its gonna go to 4 and we are gonna have depression. Can you believe it?

&amp;#x200B;

[Oil : $4 to $40.](https://preview.redd.it/0p2cpix7hce91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06030e7d0e8e0f9c51b76209448021a25722edfd)

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Nope. \*\*Hmm JP Morgan said similar thing with Oil $350. Are they all f'ing with us.

**Peter :** I remember one time it was money supply going too fast. We are gonna have depression. They were going too slow then too we were gonna have depression. Then there was Ldc debt. All the banks were very smart and lend all their net worth to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Chile and bunch of all other countries that are hard to pronounce. These countries weren't doing well and were less developed. Now we have to call them emerging countries. It’s politically very incorrect to call a country an undeveloped country. The other day i found out that the term for somebody overweight is laterally challenged. So there was this rumor that all these Ldc debts given to countries were going to go bankrupt. And we were gonna have depression.

Then there was Mid-east fighting going on and they weren’t gonna buy our bonds and market crashing and we would have depression. And then there was Japan crisis. They weren’t gonna buy our bonds and we were gonna have depression. Within 3 yrs Nikkei index went from 40,000 to 16,000. The banking system was in trouble. People said Japan was gonna collapse. And we were gonna have depression. Then there were issues like Global warming and real estate etc. 

**So the thing is as older as you get the more nervous you become of all these things. Younger people are hence better investors coz they are not worried and they haven't heard about all these crisis.** If you don't have any kids you gotta rent kids for weekend. Seriously. And ask him about money supply. Ask him about the shape of yield curve is it bad or good. Or that we are into 48.3 months of economic recovery. The average recovery is less than 52.3 months. Ask an 8 yr old about all this. The reason being they have high exp of about the next 20 yrs. That’s what you need to do.

The more you get away from 8 yr old, the more you start reading about these crazy things from weekend. You are not gonna make it.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact from 1955 to 1985 the stock market went up grand total of 1000 pts but it was down 800 on Mondays. So there it was 1800 up on non Mondays. It wasn't accident that stock market went down in October 1987 on Monday. People on the weekend become economists in portfolio strategies. I remember this day on Monday. I took vacation a week before. My fund went from 13B to 9B in two working days. So there was this rumor circulating that i knew market was gonna go down on Monday.

**In all i wanna say i can guarantee you that the market is gonna be lot higher in 15 yrs. It will be a lot higher in 25 yrs.** What’s it gonna do in the next 1 or 2 yrs i have no idea. Here’s a cool thing about interest rate. If you get them right 5 times in a row with ten grand you can have $2B. There is not lot many people with $2B and still lot of people take credit for predicting interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

So in general i don't care about all of this. **All i know In 96 yrs of century market has fallen 53 times with 10% or more decline.** That means once every 2 yrs we have 10% decline. Out of 53 declines 15 have been 25% or more. So 15 times in 96 yrs. **That is once every 6 yrs market falls 25% or more.** That’s what we call bear market. It’s all gonna happen but i don't care when its gonna happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me ;** Wow sir that's a lot. Anything you wanna add more.

**Peter :** You want more. Okay  

Here’s a quick summary of some more points that you need to keep in back of your mind :

* Don't forget about **investing internationally.** I made a bunch of my money there because of less coverage by the media and less people interested in following companies.
* **There’s always a company that is mispriced.** If you look at 10 you will find one. If you look 100 you will find 10. So go out there and find them.
* Most people ask me “When to sell a stock” Well i always tell them whatever the reason was for **buying the stock that must be your reason to sell** and when.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s a really cool piece of advice you’’ll love it.

**Me :** Yes sir. Do tell.

**Peter :** Diversification is sh9t. I call it diefaecation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** What? Everybody on Youtube tells me to diversify my portfolio.

**Peter :** They are probably a bunch of fools. I call them amateur. **Just own one damn good stock**. No need to buy 2 and 3 and balance their beta alpha whatever. This all makes investing so easy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** So sir you’re telling me to place all my chips in one basket.

**Peter :** Look man while buying a stock you have to know a good story. **If you come across 10 good. I do that too. Find 10 good attractive companies.** It makes me feel like i’m watching a poker game. So story 3 gets better, but story 6 get flops, story 7 remains same but it goes up 50% so sell 7 and buy 2.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir you just told me to pick one earlier. Now you're telling me to pick 10. What is it?

**Peter :** God you're the worst guy ever I have come across. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sorry. \*Sad face

**Peter :** Okay. Don’t start crying now. Here i will give the three total BS advise that you will ever come across.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*Excited Yes sir. Do tell.

**Peter :**  

&amp;#x200B;

* Women can't control money and deal with personal finance.
* We are in 4th innings of bull market
* And number 3rd which could be possible true. There will be a lot less US banks in future because UK has very less banks

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** None of that is useful to me

**Peter :** \*\*Angrily gets out of chair. God get out of my house. You have done nothing but wasted my 2 hrs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** What did i do

**Peter :** You keep asking these stupid question in b/w and never get anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Maybe its because i have been scrolling lots of sh9tposts recently

**Peter :** Just go back to wherever you came from man.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir i think we are heading to depression. I just don't know if its Stagflationary or Deflationary

**Peter :** Were you even making notes in the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Yes sir. I was.

**Peter :** So just read your goddamn notes and get out. Never come back here again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*Walks to door. 

**Peter :** \*Shuts the door on my face.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Hmm i forgot to ask him about this balance sheet

&amp;#x200B;

[Can you identify the balance sheet?](https://preview.redd.it/jz1zy7yhdce91.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4b4229b324b3ffc5c40e685145e17ef1c3293a)

&amp;#x200B;

**Peter :** This upcoming generation is gonna be poor. Just no imagination on how the stock market works.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*Heads back to home. So what did i miss. Lemme check. Wtffff. Its July 28 and the Gdp is -ve. Technical recession. Yesss. Exactly as i predicted. Man imma genius of Wall Street i predicted 8.8% above inflation and now this Gdp.

 

\*Checks the market 

What the f….. Why is the market going up. Huhhhhhh.

Thank you for reading this guys. I hope you enjoyed it. Tbh you can get this advise from watching Peter Lynch seminar from 90's or reading any of his books. I don't hold any rights to call this my article. Also my strategy is clearly different since i'm the ""Depressing bear"" that Lynch hates. Hence I put these kinds of content in specials. I also do hope you get the underlying meaning associated with this conversation held and try relating it with current scenario. If you do then comments down below to share your experience. I love hearing your opinion guys.

PLL is way down because of unrelated reasons, AND they are getting the run around from local government, but what I can positively tell you is nobody is going to stop them from make their NC lithium mine from happening.  Albemarle is another lithium company that is super successful and they have existing mines in the area.  They are already in bed with Tesla, if PLL can't get it done (they already own the land) Tesla will just come in and finish the project and mine their own lithium.  This will be the largest lithium mine in the east half of the USA.

They obviously don't seem to think their lack of permits is an actual problem because they are literally buying peoples houses, burning them to get them out of the way, and clearing land already.  I'm 200 shares in on the fact that they have a tigercat alone, if I find a wolfdog machine I'm buying another 500 shares.  I like obvious money when I see it, and nothing is more obvious than calling a tiger a cat because tigercat.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",2022-11-30 Wrinkle-brain Plays (Mathematically derived options plays),1.0,2022-11-30 03:01:37

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

Last week was almost Perfect, we almost got everything on the watchlist right on the money, no one can get all their plays perfectly obviously so the weeks where we do is cause for celebration at least for me.

For Earnings, we had $ZM puts, $DE puts, and $BBY calls. All ran in the direction we hoped for 100%-200% plays, except DE.

As for economic plays, we only had FOMC minutes and as expected, we got a little pump. I have zero clue why anyone on Twitter and Reddit would be bearish on minutes for a meeting that already happened and we say a dovish statement for. But each to his own, we made our $$$.

For those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  
**Port % Change:** 1101%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts.

Cashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out.

Averaged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March ‘23 swing.

As we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.

So overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* TSLA 03/17/2022 220.00 C

So we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.

This month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.

With USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts

**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**JPow Speech**

JPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.

A lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.

I think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.

**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**PCE**

Now we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

I'm still long NFLX as long as it holds the upward trendline, if I see a clear failure of the line, will be exiting my position, but if it holds, will add more. From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.

**- AAPL Long**

Has been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target

**- TSLA Long**  
We got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

My 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move.

I’ll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.

If my assumptions are correct with this week’s events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i’ll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

Stocks were higher early Wednesday with the Nasdaq gaining more than 1% and the price of oil down more than 4% on the final full trading day of the week for U.S. investors.

&amp;#x200B;

Near 10:30 a.m. ET, all three major indexes were higher, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.5%, the Dow up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq higher by 1%.

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. markets will be closed for Thanksgiving, and markets are open for just a half day on Black Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

The move higher in stocks comes amid a busy day for economic data, with reads on the labor market, housing market, and manufacturing sector all coming out early Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest data on weekly jobless claims showed 240,000 new filings for unemployment insurance were made last week, the most since mid-August. Economists expected initial claims to total 225,000 for the week ending November 19.

&amp;#x200B;

Durable goods orders for October were also released early Wednesday, showing orders rose 1% last month against expectations for a 0.4% increase, according to data from Bloomberg.

&amp;#x200B;

S&amp;P Global's preliminary read on business activity in November showed a continued slowdown in economic output, with the firm's manufacturing PMI falling to a 30-month low, while service sector activity hit a three-month low. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist Chris Williamson said Wednesday these reports are consistent with an economy contracting at an annualized rate of 1%.

&amp;#x200B;

Consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan showed consumers remain downbeat about their prospects, with the index falling 5% from October to a reading of 56.8, down from 59.9. ""Along with the ongoing impact of inflation, consumer attitudes have also been weighed down by rising borrowing costs, declining asset values, and weakening labor market expectations,"" said Joanne Hsu, direct of the survey of consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

On the housing front, new home sales unexpectedly increased in October, rising 7.5% to an annualized rate of 632,000, much faster than the 570,000 annualized rate expected by economists.

&amp;#x200B;

The minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting are also set for release on Wednesday afternoon to round out a busy economic calendar.","Stocks rose, tsla soared, Dow climbed ahead of Fed minutes, jobless claims surged. What do you think?",1.0,2022-11-23 16:03:16

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  
In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays. 

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014  
**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, im currently have 

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* SPXW 12/06/2022 4100.00 C
* TSLA 11/25/2022 180.00 C
* TWST 04/21/2023 25.00 P

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so its pull the account value down, i got alot of time on most these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on. 

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much. 

# Major Economic Events

**Wednesday 11/09**

8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct  
9:45 AM S&amp;P PMI Flash Nov  
2:00 PM FOMC Minutes

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

# Earnings

# Monday 21 Nov

**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 &amp; Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.

# Tue 22 Nov

**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**

* Retail Trade
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.032 &amp; Revenue $10.3B
* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings
* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell

# Wed 22 Nov

**Before Open - Deere &amp; Company ($DE)**

* Industrial
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $7.12 &amp; Revenue $13.5B
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.

Other notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE 

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

https://preview.redd.it/5b822iml471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7ca2769c4f20251ab7413e26ee0305c6452ee9

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

https://preview.redd.it/se5xtv8m471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a49615a9f7b4f176a5517366fb5f1fde90cb3ec6

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

https://preview.redd.it/04ud0cwm471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7d0bb3d61d723824c57302a3b727410c5560c5

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

https://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c67c9f39558996148549530fec9a8ca90d2fbb

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

* **""Hardcore"" rallying call**: Eliminates unnecessary bloat and keeps dedicated workers
* **Starting &amp; stopping $8 program**: A short demonstration to advertisers that Twitter is no longer cow-towing to special interests
* **Publicly fires critics:** Shows he isn't a spineless leader and is willing to take decisive action
* **Asks for print-outs of code:** Puts his engineers on notice that he is scrutinizing their work and they need to be able to defend it

All of these actions display a level of decisiveness and ruthlessness that was lacking in Twitter's leadership. This also bodes well for TSLA, which is down nearly 20% in the last 30 days.

1072,1668545880,yw9c78,1,"After news of Russian missiles landing in Poland, let's discuss why space satellites would be the best bet going forward into the next world war.

1. Who bothers with space? Does Russia control their space-space?Will they shoot down commercial satellites hovering above them? NO
2. Communications are vitally important during wartime. However, infrastructure tends to... not survive when giant exploding dildos are flying everywhere. Because of point 1, therefore, space antennae become even more important. 
3. That's where space mobile communications comes into play:

ASTS had an earnings call yesterday, along with news that they have 'unfurled' their test antennae in space. BULLISH NEWS! This is the beginning of giant green dildos, brothers! 

SpaceX already had their WiFi satellites in space, and have already deployed them in Ukraine via their Starlink product. 

Currently in the world, only a handful of private companies are doing such endeavors, and these two companies have the highest profiles in the space. On top of being able to quickly and more cheaply access customers in rural or desolate areas, this will ALSO enable good communications in a war-zone as well.

Love you all, and wish you all the best. For everyone asking what my next moves are here it is:

As of right now, I believe the bear market rally is coming to an end. Maybe there is a bit more upside, but I don't want to miss the downside. I personally like the risk-to-reward here.

TA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200 day SMA SPY,  FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \~3490, sentiment etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally. Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on.

I am short

My only long position is $ASTS right now, which I trimmed today bigly.

**But be aware, I will scale in and out of these short positions on a whim. I have a HUGE short/long watchlist, and if I sense there is money to be made elsewhere I will rotate my money.**

Stuff on my watchlist

$TMUS

$CAT

$DE

$LI

and a ton of other stocks.

This is not financial advice, this is for the people curious about what my next move is.

Ok, so Elon paid about 45bn on this deal. He had 20bn in cash sitting around apparently. He doesn´t want to sell TSLA stock for the other 25bn, so he takes loans instead. So far so good.

From the 25bn loans, 13bn are just regular loans and 12bn are just margin loans using TSLA stock as collateral. This is the first thing I don´t understand. Why only 12bn are margin loans? Why would the banks accept to loan 13bn with no collateral?

And the collaterals, are they a specified number of shares or a specified dollar worth of shares?

Then there's the fact that the Twitter company itself got leveraged to the tits during the deal? How? Was it just a clause in the contract that the company had to take a lot of leverage beforehand or Elon wouldn't buy it?

**TL;DR** total purchases and sales are down \~30% from the past week, while total participants are up at least 75%. Another 279 insiders filed Form 4s, bringing the total filing to 622.

A quick note on Elon - the sales are not represented here **\*yet\*** since they are **Indirect** trades and the reports only included **Direct** purchases and sales. **Indirect trades will be added moving forward.**

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases decreased from $76.5M to $53.7M (-30%)
* Sales decreased from $1.1B to $740M (-31%)
* Transactions increased from 383 to 679 (+77%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 225 to 394 (+75%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 49 (+96%)
   * Net sellers increased from 200 to 345 (+73%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 343 to 622 (+81%)
   * Net buyers increased from 45 to 108 (+140%)
   * Net sellers increased from 298 to 514 (+72%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 31st - November 4th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 24th - October 28th.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

As always, appreciate any feedback that you have on the reports, stats, etc.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  
In this post, we will cover

* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

We  absolutely crushed it! So missed $TWLO that was a bad play, $TSLA never  ran to $250 but some profit was made there, if you got out early (i  didnt). And $NFLX &amp; $PIN never triggered, so no play.

But earnings plays $CVNA $SQ $ROKU $ETSY $AMD (everyone thought this wouldnt run) $MRNA all were home runs.

Economic  events FOMC meeting went as planned too everyone said 75bps would sell  off, but it ran as expected, then we played the Speech as went along.

Watchlist, $DB, $SPY also played out as expected, so all in all good week!

**Friday 11/11**

11:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment

Obviously  all these are important, but the only one we would be interested in  playing would be the CPI day. You can play CPI day 2 ways

**Option 1:**

Wait  for the results, after the initial drop or jump, the day usually  follows the same direction, you dont have to guess, and you would make  the ALOT of $$ by waiting it out and picking direction after that. If  you play same day options, chop might kill your plays anyway. This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.

**Option 2:**  
Speculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody’s chart  below.

https://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d

So  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)

So that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed’s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  ‘’influncers’’ would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.

The  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  
Remember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much. So play accordingly.

# Earnings

Monday 07 Nov

**After Close - Lyft Inc ($LYFT)**

* Transportation
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.069 &amp; Revenue $1.056B
* Options pricing in a 18.6% move on earnings
* My  Play: Very bearish flow and $UBER earnings results were mixed too (ran  because of guidance &amp; bookings), going with the flow here, they laid  off alot of employees not a great sign. Taking ATM puts today

Tue 08 Nov

**After Close - Affirm Holdings Inc ($AFRM)**

* Technology/Internet Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $-0.842 &amp; Revenue $360M
* Options pricing in a 25% move on earnings
* My  Play: Almost all banks beat, $HOOD beat, $SOFI beat, very bullish flow,  im going with ATM calls for this one, corelation doesnt equal  causation, anything can happen, if you want to play safe you still make  ALOT of money with a straddle given the 25% implied move.

* Consumer Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.554 &amp; Revenue $21.3B
* Options pricing in a 8.3% move on earnings
* My  Play: Overly bullish flow, my gut says they miss with the $NFLX beat,  and China Park shutdown, but im going with flow on this one maybe there  is something i dont know.

**Before Open - Roblox Corpartion ($RBLX)**

* Technology/Packaged Software
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS $-0.31 &amp; Revenue $692.2 million

Thu 10 Nov

**Before Open - AstraZenca PLC ($AZN)**

* Health Care/Biotechnology
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST
* Estimates: EPS 0.758 &amp; Revenue $10.78 billion
* Options pricing in a 5.2% move on earnings
* My  Play: Will probably end up skipping this, not a crazy move here as most  pharmas already reported, they almost all beat, so calls would be the  play here

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**  
Looks  like the market might be bullish till CPI, $TSLA Held $203.84 Support  as long this line holds, first TP for me will be $216.8 and then $224

https://preview.redd.it/zygiyx04oiy91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77f7b5237249743b8c64a758d80e5f329030e65e

**- $AMD Long/Short**  
Has  not been able to break throught the $62.7 level since earnings, pretty  much in a channel now, if it breaks resistance will go long, if it cant  will short till next support at $60

https://preview.redd.it/p0gb25n4oiy91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05e6b5ae9e4dfc0b496c9e6fbb5b2a848593300

**- $VIX Long**

Lot  of chatter lately about VIX big spike coming soon, while i personally  dont see it, the trend lines we drew 4 month ago, remain respected so my  play here, is if we break and hold $25.6 resistance ill take calls, if  that fails we are likely going back to retest the trend and likely break  it all the to $22 at which point i would take profits

https://preview.redd.it/dh5dkad5oiy91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0109cc262fee83a420316fcd9e9af8b9f522feb

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Im  not going to add something just to have a play, i couldn’t find  anything, SPX will for sure be 10X play on CPI day, but beyond that i  got nothing this week. But i will 100% find a good for next week.

Alright,  so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going  through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice

I wish you all a very green week!","My Full Plan for this Week 11/07 + Challenge Update (3 Watchlist Plays + 6 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event (CPI))",1.0,2022-11-07 11:46:05
1139,1667784433,yo8wsx,1,"Fellow Regards,

First off, I'd like to thank u/Phx-Jay for bringing this company to my attention.  
I've spent the weekend analyzing a potential play here and my results are as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

# What Do They Do?

* Digital Advertising

# Financial Statement Analysis (10-Q)

* [TTD Previous 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=116875532&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=TTD&amp;companyName=The+Trade+Desk+Inc.&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2022-08-09&amp;CK=1671933)
* I know you regards are too autistic to understand financial statements, so I'll leave the executive summary below (*as opposed to walking through their B/S, I/S, Cash Flow, etc...*)
* Their net income has had a very wild swing for both 3 months and 6 months ending in June 30th.
* Three month change is *negative 140%*
* Six month change is *negative 148%*

https://preview.redd.it/ou6y3zp3hfy91.png?width=2545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cddeff90ec0ab3d648670f78f05373c4a510bc

* You can also see that their revenue has increased due to advertising campaigns executed per client. This is why the stock pumped on last earnings.

[Revenue increase from last earnings, but expenses are now much greater.](https://preview.redd.it/8cp7tw5rhfy91.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d79ae8c1979eb46d2a2cfeef2679023df63ee49)

* As their revenue increased, so did their expenses which eclipsed whatever additional revenue came in at that time. Here is a breakdown of their increased expenses.

# Price per Earnings Ratio

* As most of you know, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the company's annual earnings per share.
* As of November 4th, TTD has a P/E ratio of 660.71
* Trend shown below for reference ([https://ycharts.com/companies/TTD/pe\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/TTD/pe_ratio))

* Just for comparison's sake, TSLA has a P/E ratio of 66.42

&amp;#x200B;

# Forward Guidance

* It's no secret that advertisement revenue is down from the big tech companies
* $META's advertising revenue declined 27.2 Billion, down \~4% YoY.
* [https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/11/02/amazon-freezing-hiring-advertising.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/11/02/amazon-freezing-hiring-advertising.html)
* Inflation, rising overhead, reduce spending by corporate.
* Forward guidance will be the primary reason for tanking this dog with fleas.

&amp;#x200B;

# TTD Insider Activity

* [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ttd/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ttd/insider-activity)
* Even the insiders know this is high overvalued and are creating bag holders from unsuspecting retail.

&amp;#x200B;

# Position or Ban

* This is my weekend DD post, I will open my position either Monday or Tuesday before earnings.
* A separate post will be created once I've bought my puts
* This will be an FD play, so expiration this coming Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

# Full Disclosure

I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

1159,1667505306,ylcwx1,1,"# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

[ The BlueWalker 3 satellite and ASTS team. From CEO's Twitter. ](https://preview.redd.it/joua2277fsx91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc623754341c9ceba87b29e4e7bf24a4522f849)

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

The BELIEVERS:

* Rakuten, American Tower, Vodafone (along w Samsung) did ASTS Series B then PIPE ($230M) investments.
* Mikitani Hiroshi is billionaire Rakuten CEO backing ASTS with a massive stake.
* Transhumanica with a detailed research paper that I highly recommend. They have an interactive valuation model with a $114 current PT.
* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $15PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

1. Kerrisdale Capital released some short seller research if you’re interested in reading a bear case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/fzv1jlvqfsx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b98ef716b7a1f45f3c4b3174edd0d32e9397b3)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[TradingView of ASTS, 1W time frame](https://preview.redd.it/ojmxwldsfsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9626a7e5b476232e8f6fb981ed415e6c1c7669d5)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Short Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that short sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, short sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious short covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a short seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” short trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of short sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their short report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from short sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/tt4grepufsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f2bbdd0d7020c98808f9565e0d3db194e3952c)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ak8ijvhwfsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5016deb82df34c51e1d9b4d59f9b2ca2bc622c55)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/dscqmdf0gsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7574cf567c54e293b1ad2b49dfd5a07796b3af71)

One of the arguments of short sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

[Note on warrant funding](https://preview.redd.it/ezj8i9n2gsx91.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6636812be27cf933dab429f7d34ae9097caac87)

The reason why I think the moves up are going to be violent is because of high interest from short sellers, including Kerrisdale. A lot of them will have to get out of the way on positive catalysts. Quick information from S3 and Ortex.

[S3 information from Mr. Ihor](https://preview.redd.it/50m9ynmagsx91.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6777efdc98eb8a64f45ca01a22d52fc359ae21b3)

&gt;Information from Ortex: 28.4% SI, 31.1% on loan, CTB 19.4%, DTC 8 days

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS, 1D timeframe on TV. Imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/7gi5lhwlgsx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea893f025a23bd720618e445b213e2bad44da647)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero. If you think this is a P&amp;D feel free to short and add fuel to the fire. Good luck.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice, I wish you all a very green week!","My Full Plan for this Week 10/31 + Challenge Update (7 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event (FOMC), 5 Stocks &amp; 1 Lotto 10x Play)",1.0,2022-10-30 20:02:35
1175,1667159565,yho3e3,1,"Hello ladies and gentlemen 

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  
In this post, we will cover

* $2k to $100k Challenge Update 
* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday. 

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:** 

https://preview.redd.it/44odj0uuyzw91.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a5b53106aa15a99fdaaeeebf17ff2c8e034a25

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes. 

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct 

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts. 

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain. 

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing 

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market. 

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium. 

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time. 

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows. 

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle. 

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now. 

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful) 

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain. 

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market. 

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen. 

But like i said we shall see.

Then again this week had Intel puts for 24 and was up 3k going into earnings. Tomorrow I’ll lose majority of it unless something happens but my advice to anyone new playing options on earnings is to sell before market closes if the earnings report is after hours. You’ll make money regardless provided you bought a couple days before the earnings call leading up to the day before earnings. I made most of my losses on TSLA back from meta puts and yea I’ll lose my initial 1k in puts on Intel but will makeup for it on my other plays in GILD, Xom, and spy.

This is permabear stuff.  A crash of legend.  One that they will talk about for centuries. Add in record debt worldwide from consumers and governments. A potential World War.  Countries inflation rates skyrocketing.  

I have to ask why every morning do you bid the market up only to watch reality sink in the rest of the day?  What the hell are you expecting to be positive right now.

At this point I've lost all hope on conventional methods and honestly think witchcraft will do as good, if not better, than any other method.  Any other ideas are greatly appreciated, but current list of questions are:

Will SPY be Up or Down 3 months from now? 6 Months from now? 

Will TSLA continue to grow production?

Will Twitter deal fall through last minute?

Will tech rebound in the next year?

Best sector to invest in for the next year?

Will WTI (Price of Oil per Barrel) go up in next year?

Are we going into a recession? Are we already in a recession? What is a recession?

1286,1666023615,y6fd2y,1,"I am going to be using the SP Futures chart because the real points of resistance are coming from the SP index, and not SPY. Yes, the same general areas for support/resistance apply, but they will not line up with nice round numbers on SPY but they will on the SP500 Futures. 

**Big Picture**

https://preview.redd.it/n9vxhzzu2eu91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6b06f62a4ac7b25aa1a63146149089dfa958cc

**A few lines on a chart for you:**

* 3250-3500 area of previous resistance. This was a battle ground after Covid and we are close to entering this zone again. 
* 3400 pre-covid high
* 3600 the current price we are fighting over

**Where are we going?** 

* Down: The bear market channel (tan lines) and the **3500** level line up pretty well and are within striking distance in the near term. That is my downside target. 
* Up: **3800** is the next area of resistance to the upside. Keep in mind volatility is still high, sentiment is still very bearish, RSI is on the lower end, and we are in the lower end of the channel. This is a setup for another bounce (remember last week?)
   * We already got a meaningful bounce this AM and it might last for several days or even weeks

**Don't press on shorts:**

* This is likely not the place to press on shorts or buy more puts. That time was last week when SPY moved up and vix moved down.
* Expect more shorts and put holders to close their positions as they get blown out by extreme moves to the upside and VIX coming down. 
* If you want to be short, *sell call spreads.* Yes, we likely will go lower but you are better off selling calls here than buying puts. 

Expect a bounce around 3500 and sell put spreads when we get there.

**Why we would go lower**

* Interest rates are going higher, yields higher, BOE is done interfering, Russia is moving nukes around and Europe is preparing, bank earnings and provide negative guidance 
* TSLA earnings and guidance shock the market to the downside 
* With today's early AM bounce, the RSI has come off the bottom and the ""pressure"" to the downside being removed, we are more likely to run out of buyers, run out of shorts needing to close and run out of hopium 

**Why would we go higher**

* Russia will reach some level of cease fire. Today they stopped the ""draft"" it seems 
* China will reopen 
* Midterms are coming
* Gas prices will be coming down most likely 
* Some level of uncertainty has been removed after last weeks economic reports. the market ""knows"" what the FED is going to do and less uncertainty = bullish
* Sentiment is/was at historic lows - setting us up for a bounce 
* TSLA earnings surprise to the upside and this lifts the whole market   


**Short Term Picture**

https://preview.redd.it/54dm14y03eu91.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698a9d80055a124df7c2cf5ac3d9ab43e30ff0da

* Notice in this picture we are about midway of the bearish channel (tan lines). This is no mans land.
* 3800 is a meaningful area to the upside, 3500 is meaningful area to the downside 

**How to Trade It:**

* Do not add buy puts here, do not go short, wait until VIX is 28 or lower, or we hit 3800. 
* Sell calls if you are bearish, but give yourself two weeks minimum and keep your sold strike at 3700 or greater (370 on SPY). 
   * **Sell -370/+380 early November call spreads on SPY. Try to collect $350&gt; in credit.** 
* Close puts, close shorts, close any bearish positions when we get to 3500. My recommendation would be to *sell put spreads* at 3500 when we reach it because VIX will be elevated 
   * **On the next big down day, or when we get closer to 3500 on SP500, sell -345/+335 early November put spreads on SPY.** You could enter a limit order today for about $350 in credit and wait for them to fill 

With both those positions filled you will have picked up $700 in credit betting that SPY is between 370 and 335 in early November. Max gain $700, max loss $300.",Trading SPY Week of Oct 17th,1.0,2022-10-17 16:20:15

There are a lot of websites that provide options chain but I couldn't find any that provide the most degenerate identification of weekly options(0-5DTE) with massive gains porn.

[This tool](https://www.thetagangster.com/) takes all the highest volume options that ppl are gang bangin and 

1. Finds the options with the BIGGEST GAINS IN THE SHORTEST TIME
2. Finds the highest volume options with the most herd like behaviour
3. Ranks the top options by their volume and their popularity
4. Finds across equity options, etf options (for you SPY heads) and index options

This can help you decide quickly what degenerate option to go for if you're the type of person who feels comfortable risking ur life savings to try to **20x your acct or go broke.**

(These are post stock split numbers)

For reference, TSLA is currently at 200 a share, down 50% from its ath of 400. So it could seem like a good deal at the moment. However when you look at it's 5 year chart (which is a surprising amount of autists here never have), you see that it was at only 30 a share in January 2020 right before the covid madness. So it seems reasonable to assume it could still fall significantly more.

The thing with TSLA stock is people aren't just investing in a car company, they're investing in all of Elons other ventures. Selfishly, I'd like to see TSLA fall to around 100 a share and if it does I'll load up on stock and continue to do so. I absolutely could see TSLA reaching 1000 a share again in the future.

**Wednesday: (Sideways)**

* Before CPI participants get prepared:
   * Buy puts to protect their long positions 
      * Market maker sells puts (long position) and shorts shares (short position) to get delta neutral 
   * Short stocks 
      * Maker buys shares (long) and buys puts (short) to get delta neutral 
   * Institutions and retail have their cash ready 
   * This interest in puts shows up in the VIX which was elevated all Wednesday going into close. 

**Thursday: (Up 1%, Down 3%, Up 5.5%)**

* Market is closed:
   * Futures drift up on hopium that the report is not as bad as expected 
   * The CPI report comes out and the market drops 3% in the pre-market 
   * The market moves a lot because there is a lot less liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads and the moves become exaggerated 
* The Market is Open:
   * This means the options market is open as well 
   * Put holders sell, this brings VIX down 
      * Market maker closes their short shares position, buying shares 
   * Short sellers close, which is a buy in the market, driving prices higher 
      * Market maker closers their short put positions, which causes others to buy shares 
   * The VIX collapses 
      * This is counterintuitive because normally when SP falls, VIX goes up, but it was the closing of put positions which drove this decline in VIX
   * Investors with cash in the sideline see a new 52 week low, and start to buy 
   * Sellers are overwhelmed by the rebalancing of puts, shorts and new longs - we move \~5% off the lows 

EVERYONE TAKES PROFITS ON SHORTS, WE GO UP

**Friday: Up 1%, Down 2%** 

* The wave of shorts covering and puts closing has subsided
* The wave of new cash on the sidelines is gone 
* Reality sets back in as the overall market, as opposed to the short term participants/market makers, continue with the overall downward trend
* All of the gains from Thursday are erased
* We stop close to where we started before the CPI report comes out 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bearish things to keep in mind going into next week:**

* Oil might continue to fall going into midterms, market maker (the US Gov), but it is [headed higher for longer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xrtkjs/the_bull_case_for_oil/)  
* Dollar doesn't seem to be slowing down 
* 2YR and 10YR yields remain elevated and it looks like they will continue to rise 
* Bank of England is removing support 
* It is consensus that .75 will be the next hike, with a meaningful chance at a 1.00 hike 
* Inflation is not subsiding, there is more work to be done, employment remains high, Powell is committed to the job and is most likely going to overcommit 
* Mega caps, and [TSLA specifically](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/), are about to finally succumb to the selling pressure and capitulate. Anyone holding TSLA beware - its not going to ""fair value"" its going to overshoot to the downside 
* Housing and rent basically can't go down (sorry to all the housing crash enthusiasts) with supply constrained. No one wants to be building, no new housings coming on the market, existing owners (should) have 3% interest rates and can't/won't sell. Everyone has to rent or bid up assets further. A decade of under building precedes this market environment. There can't be ""demand destruction"" if there is a greater number of ""sellers destroyed"" by even greater market dynamics than rates 
* Russia running out of options. Even if peace/deal is reached globalization is over and the west hasn't quite realized that

&amp;#x200B;

**How to win:** 

Sell call spreads until we test the low, then sell put spreads why SPY is around 348-350 level. Don't buy puts until VIX is under 27/28 otherwise IV crush and theta can eliminate nearly all your gains (this is why your long options are net losers).",SPY Last Three Days Explained,1.0,2022-10-14 22:19:34

1320,1665703711,y3dla7,1,"# SPY

It first started with $75.35K SPY in naked calls which were purely based on the extensive oversold market and almost a day trade. That trade amounted to over 220K in a very short amount of time. 

# Credit Suisse (CS)

Credit Suisse had super cheap premiums and where super undervalued due to the amount of fear in $CS Credit Default Spreads. Which is a bet on a company/country's chance of defaulting, i.e. a put option on a bond.

https://preview.redd.it/rkb6fum8lnt91.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=587c215d6cc4836f019870cb8010c926e68a6c43

People used this to show fear of the company, and not what it really reveals. The peaks actually mark the bottoms. 

https://preview.redd.it/qfhgmx5qlnt91.jpg?width=1450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb28b0d245c90d20575ff809261fe34eb6504118

As you can see here. So, by using the crazy amount of bearish sentiment and playing against it by buying dirt cheap premiums there was a more likely chance you would come with a profit. On Oct. 3  CS 1Y spread shot over 500bps and 5Y spread over 300bps.  This indicated a &gt;23% chance the Swiss bank will default on its bonds within 5Y. CS  stock promptly sold off 12% intraday. Which triggered most people to stay away, but to me an opportunity. This sell-off was because CEO Ulrich Koerne sent a memo to staffnancially saying CS is stable.  A little after some news reports resurfaced **$5.5B loss in Archegos fiasco - $400M fine for Mozambique “tuna bonds” scandal - Bulgarian mafia money laundering** which then backfired. Now CS CET1 ratio is currently 13.1% which is well above the 9.6% regulatory minimum. What is that? Common Equity Tier 1 or CET1 compares a bank's liquid capital (cash + stock) vs. assets, i.e. an indicator of the ability to avoid default.

To top that then bounced off their support trend line. I can also see this company rallying for the next 6-12 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

# (TSLA) 

This was definitely a bad trade, there is no doubt about that. Not much to say closed for \~150k (I think)

# (SPY)

This was my life saver trade which brought me all the way back up. I went all In my full account right before CPI data. Let me tell you when 8:30 came I saw the futures drop 2% in seconds I was distraught, but I held. Not going to go too in-depth, but SPY also had a crazy amount of bearish sentiment and everything was priced in.  This then caused S&amp;P500 to swing \~200 points from the day’s trough to its peak, a surge of &gt;5%.  Extreme negativity, oversold prices &amp; lean long positioning served as potent bone-dry tinder susceptible to even the smallest spark.

Today's action confirms the shift in sentiment. 

SPY stages a nearly 1.75% reversal in 2 hours. AAPL, MSFT and others all follow suit. 

&amp;#x200B;

[SPY reversal ](https://preview.redd.it/j8h2bogye7t91.png?width=1873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cff7c339ceee1821fddf617e213575daf929966e)

TSLA breaks the reversal trend just moving sideways during the up moves of the market, and down on the down moves.

VIX collapsing. 2yr and 10yr rates falling. Crude is down. DXY is down. All of these are positive catalysts for growth stocks in the short term, but TSLA isn't following the trend.

All opinions welcome, including the 5 IQ ones. I received cap gains earlier in the year for 80k USD. This is dividends from a startup I worked out being sold.

I have been holding a 03/2023 283c TSLA call for since March 2021. I spent 55k USD on the contracts. It’s currently down -40k USD (lmfao this fucking robot).

I’m thinking about selling my TSLA calls to offset the cap gains tax I’ll have to pay on the 80K. I don’t think this contract will print. If I wait to sell and it’s a loss next year, I don’t have any guaranteed cap gains I can use to subtract it from.

Curious if anyone has any thoughts about this. Part of me wants to yolo for the TSLA calls and another part wants to offset the cap gains tax. I can always reposition in TSLA with the remaining contract value once liquidated.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",2022-10-04 Better Tasting Crayons (Mathematically derived options plays),1.0,2022-10-04 01:40:40

This year, there have been more than two dozen trading sessions in which trading in puts has outpaced calls (source: CBOE Global Markets). Put options volume across all U.S. listed symbols hit an all-time high going back to 2008.

Even $TSLA with its cultish following of call buyers hit a new record of put buyers last week.

Let me explain by clarifying, I am very new to investing I only have about 6 months of experience with Etherium. So take everything I say as a suggestion, not fact with that being said; here is my Idea:

As we all know now, the combustion engine is slated to be killed, with some companies even stopping production as early as 2025. So suggesting an EV manufacturing company is going to take off isn't a hard thing to believe. What I myself do believe is that Rivian at the moment is falling into obscurity, with a net income of -1.7B, and a 52wk low of just $18.

If together we let this fall, to its low which by the look of things it's going to do. You could buy it dirt cheap.

But why, how could a failing EV company grow with subpar vehicles, especially in a growing competitive market?; well Rivian has partnered with Mercedes Benz to bring the first luxury Suv EV to the market. I think that this EV will take off rocketing Rivian to the top with, an ungodly amount of buy-ins.

Once again very new to this, and do not have a degree by any means this is just a hunch I have and with the help of this sub I think we could turn this stock into the next GME, let me know what you think (Might be the dumbest shit ever, might be the best buy ever we will see eh?.

1462,1664203427,xol9qd,1,"I am a red-blooded U.S.-based investor and I have performed practical research that indicates that the GBP will continue to free fall relative to the USD.  **I am targeting exchange rates below 0.25 GBP to 1.00 USD.**

I was doing some spring cleaning this weekend and I found my keepsake box.  I took a break to look through it and reminisce, and under 5 pairs of your mom’s panties I found some old GBP bank notes that I kept as souvenirs when my career in the professional corgi-riding circuit was tragically cut short due to a knee injury.

So, I decided to do some research.  I took the GPBs to five establishments to see what I could buy with them.  The results were shocking:

At McDonalds, I asked for a quarter-pounder with cheese.  When I presented the money the cashier looked back at me and said “what is this?”  I told him that it was British currency and he said he couldn’t accept it.  I quickly realized the problem and re-ordered a “royale with cheese.”  The cashier told me that they didn’t have that on the menu.  I realized that I had to account for the lower exchange rate, so I revised my order to an eighth-pounder, no cheese.  Still no luck.  I finally asked for the largest amount of food I could buy with the money and I was kindly asked to leave.  Not a good start for the GBP.

I tried several other places: Costco, Jamba Juice, Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Apple store, etc.  I even tried to go to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond WITH one of those 20.0%-off coupons that they shit into my email inbox every other week - no luck.

No one wanted to take this British money.  Feeling confident in my due diligence, I stopped for a frosty at Wendy’s on my way home.  I paid with USD, because I would never try to swindle little Wendy or her late father Dave.

As I was pulling away from the drive-thru, next to the dumpster I saw who I can only assume was a WSB degenerate with a sign that said “will bend over for TSLA shares.”  I showed him the GPB notes and asked him what I could get with that.  He said he didn’t want my clown paper, but said that he could help me out “on the house” because he needed the “experience” for the forthcoming recession.  I quickly drove away - I don’t need some unpaid intern bugging me every five minutes saying “how else can I help, how else can I help?”

So, in closing: I tried to use British currency to purchase goods and services at multiples stores in my area of America.  NONE were willing to accept my cash.  This leads me to believe that the GBP will fall much, much further, and may even be completely worthless.","Why the British Pound will fall much, much lower against the U.S. Dollar.",1.0,2022-09-26 14:43:47

###What is LAZR?

LAZR is a company that builds sensors for self driving cars it is located in Florida

###What is so great about LAZR?

A few things come to mind

1. It's founder is the youngest self made billionaire in history he started with around a 100k and made his first billion by the age of 26

2. The company has three separate self made billionaires investing in it

3. The company already has contracts with China and Japan and 30 of the largest car manufacturing businesses in the world


###So why has the stock tanked so hard since 2020????

That's a stupid question we are in a bear market very few things are going to come out of this unscathed 


###Why did a analyst lower its price target???

Also a stupid question 🙄 it's obvious because most analysis are overpaid people with fancy degrees that like to pretend they understand the market when in reality no one truly knows what will happen we are all just guessing.


###So why should I listen to you???

You shouldn't do your own DD but I'm serious when I say that by 2030 its going to make people super wealthy! It's like buying TSLA when it first came out

I didn't explain to you all here that I made a program that calculated the odds out for me.  I'm actually a bit of a quantitative analyst.  So I started working on my program some more and I ironed out a few kinks, and my program gave some interesting results after the fomc conference.  It caught a correlation and it gave a very high degree of accuracy of the following:

Here's what I predicted on 9/21, and here's what actually happened:

https://preview.redd.it/dl32l3rnhqp91.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd1ec7d5e7109d2e502866dfc2f55a3719ec87b

TWO days ago I made a prediction of todays open and nailed it, TO THE PENNY.  If you guessed every trading day what the open would be, to the penny for TSLA, you would only get it right once every 8.75 years or so.  I also was only 2 pennies off from nailing the close of yesterday.  And only 32 cents of from nailing the open of yesterday.  

Here's proof that I called the things before they happened:  

Here's where I posted it on [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/ItAlwaysWorksOut/message/486290636)

Here's a screen shot of that post:

The odds of getting THAT accurate are astonishing.  It blows my mind.  I calculated the odds out and to get the close of yesterday within two pennies, followed by the open dead on, would only happen after 1,441,464 guesses ( Or 5720 years).

Now here's the part for you!  The program also calculates with a high degree of accuracy that TSLA will open on monday at $268.36 and close on monday at $259.43.",GUYS you might want to see this.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* Last week's plays and what I learned from them
* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

There is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all this, so you can check that out if you don't like reading

Ok so let's get this show on the road

So we had 12 Plays Last Week in chronological order as they unfold

(2 No plays - 7 Wins - 3 Losses)

**$SPX dump at Open:** Went exactly as planned grabbed SPX next day puts  PM, on the pump, the market opened to a huge dump, 300%+ play.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$SPX relief rally:** Also as expected after the dump, SPX bounced off  390.6 level and as per the plan we closed my SPX Friday calls before JPow Speech at the 4000ish level, 150%+ play  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$DWAC** Was a little late on this one as it was 20% down in the PM already before open. Got in after the pop at the open, when it hit the 200MA.At one point we were up 50%. But news came out before market close that the vote was delayed and the sponsor will loan them the money for an extension causing it to pump.Luckily it lost all gains the next day PM and i still held the puts. It pumped after they delayed the meeting again and puts went to 0. I'm not done with this turd, will be back for it in October for the meeting.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Getting in late is one of the first obvious mistakes. Not following my rule for selling above 50% is the second mistake. Not taking a second chance to get out of my puts was the 3rd mistake. Will need to apply my basic trading rules more strictly, got swept up in 10x potential.

**$SAVA** Absolute beast ran 15% from where we got in, but I got leaps so profit is nothing too crazy up 30% so far, but green is green.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Should have added some short-term calls, as it was getting alot of traction on reddit

**$GTLB** Beat earnings, revenue &amp; Guidance, yet still dropped in the PM. No reasons for this to happen, but this is the nature of earnings. Recovered by the open, but offcourse IV crush took 50% off its value. Averaged down at the open. Then it ran, as it should have, up 8.5% where I sold for a small 10% profit. Better than being right and selling at a loss I guess.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Should have held longer, ran up alot more for the rest of the week up 20%+ from earnings, should have placed a stop loss and let it run

**$NIO** This was straight up a bad call, missed EPS and guidance, it ran after market open went up 3%, sold for 20$ profit. I GOT LUCKY, this was a bad call.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** I mostly relied on sparse options flow for direction, it has a low PPS, likely most action would have been in shares action, not options, which were clearly selling off.

**$GME** Bought puts on Tuesday, and it just kept selling off, was up 75%ish so had to take profits. Sold and rebought with profits after it pumped a little for earnings. Got killed on earnings puts went to zero, earnings missed as expected but pumped on FTX partnership  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Stock has lots of supporters who buy the stock on any kind of news, puts would have worked if they were long-term, as it should dump hard if the market goes down.

**$SPX Dump after Jpow Speech:** We got a dump at 4017ish resistance, where i picked up puts as per plan BUT it very quickly rebounded and kept going up till stop loss hit, made 50% on this one.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$DOCU:** Not much to say here, everybody was expecting a miss, but they didn't, puts went to 0  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$KR:** Beat earnings, didn't run too much even with a bullish market, made 15%, not bad  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$MSFT $AAPL** Took no plays, no triggers activated

Ok so now that we have last week wrapped up and behind us, This week is going to be pretty damn exciting with CPI numbers coming out, so we have to be prepared.

# Earnings this week that I will play

But before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time

How I play earnings:

* buy shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes
* lotto size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don’t go over 5% size on any earning’s play
* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad

So now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it

**Earnings**

**Monday 12 Sep 22**  
After Close - Oracle Corp. - $ORCL

* World's largest database management company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.07 &amp; Revenue $11.3B
* Unusual Options: The $75.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 1.37 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My play: Not gonna lie I can't decide on this one, data/chart seems very neutral, leaning more towards puts here, taking a very small position here.

**Thursday 15 Sep 22**  
After Close - Adobe Inc. - $ADBE

* Packaged software company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $3.334 &amp; Revenue $4.443B
* Unusual Options: $390.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 9.93 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 7.5% move on earnings
* The stock was down 14 days in a row, before getting a dead cat bounce
* My play: 23sep 395c going with the flow here on this one, with $DOCU beat, a beat here seems likely too

# Major Economic Events

We are going into CPI with a VERY interesting, very bearish SPY hourly chart. We are right at 200MA, we have a very overbought RSI, that remained overbought all of Friday, and we have a big gap that is yet to be filled.

https://preview.redd.it/9pu4yjw5y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa29a540e4f60fb1417966169bc801c324ecfdf

From a trend point of view, we are at a very critical level. For the market to continue its downward trend it needs to make a lower high here. If it breaks this level, this is no longer a relief bounce and we have a reversal on our hands.

https://preview.redd.it/gj2r0pu6y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f0dcede9e90b6e7e95dee8da72889f8679f952

From a technical standpoint, everything points to sell off on CPI print. If that is the case the game plan here are some scenarios and how to play them:

1. Good CPI Read: We can see a sell-off all the way down to fill the gap, cooling off the chart. Then a retest of the 200MA, trapping shorts and triggering a squeeze. In which case our first take profit target is 401.2 at or before the gap fills on the way down.After gap fills, We have the 21MA between the gap fill and 200MA, if it rebounds and breaks 21MA then we should switch to calls. If it fails to break 21MA and falls back then puts are still in play.
2. Good CPI Read: We can see a big sell-off Sunday overnight all the way to CPI red on Monday AM, to reset the charts and then pump back up. In which case we would just take calls after CPI read
3. Bad CPI Read: We can see a sell-off and a hard reject off 200MA like we did in August and a free fall all the way to the 50MA, in that case, I would place my stop above the gap fill level and move it down as we keep falling, first take profit target at 50MA

https://preview.redd.it/oosxz008y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e362e872c975517f0b17098a1c9c456a72bf8da

I don't see a scenario where we don't dump to reset the charts at the very least, that's why I took a starter position of Sep14 SPX 3990p on Friday. And will be religiously taking profits and managing stop losses.

The rest of the week is where it gets very tricky, why? These are the last 5 CPI reads and what happened afterApr. 12, 2022 (Tues) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week

May 11, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Jun. 10, 2022 (Fri) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week

Jul. 13, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Aug. 10, 2022 (Wed) - Pumped on CPI read day and pumped for the rest of the week

As you can see the data is very inconclusive, as matter of fact it seems to be alternating every month, so if this trend continues we should reverse whatever happens on the CPI read day, for the rest week. Offcourse this is not reliable so we won't be looking at that for direction.

Luckily since we are at pivotal levels, I expect an overall follow-through, last 2 CPI reads showed inflation decreasing, we are actually expecting, deflation for august at -0.01% read and the headline read of 8.1%.

https://preview.redd.it/6rpu4pfay7n91.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9550ccaa78dcb53e08ac18bd1a7f447271d2550c

At or below these levels and 75bps is off the table completely which is what the market has already priced in. Not only will we pump this week, but we will also probably pump for the rest of Q4 22, as fed pivots in Q1 23. If you see these numbers or below, you might want to get yourself some calls, cause we are pumping hard.

If you see anything above these numbers prepare yourself for a new low this year and load up on puts. We have:

**Monday 09/12**

08:30 AM CPI/Inflation Rate Aug

**Tuesday 09/13**

08:30 AM PPI Aug

**Wednesday 09/14**

08:30 AM Retail Sales MoM Aug  
08:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims MoM Aug

**Thursday 09/15**

10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment Sep

I'm leaning towards a drop and pump but no need to guess here, we have our levels and plays ready.

# Watchlist

**$NVDA** has a small gap to fill up to $149.8, if the market continues its run on Monday this gap could fill and would take Calls at open if the market is bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/bcw2djfcy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51cfd2ae890782af83646dc37af1807a10ccab08

**$TSLA** has been going sideways for a while now and we are at a pivotal level, should make a big move whichever way the market breaks, if sentiment is bullish and we can break $315 expect a move to $364 quickly. If the market is bearish, we go back quickly to 50MA, lose that and $207 is my next target

https://preview.redd.it/aq0zbuady7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360ce4bd6b83a37d3c174c140135fa6141854930

**$UPST** is another gap fill play to $30, that's a 15% move from current prices. Same-week calls would print hard if the market is bullish

https://preview.redd.it/ujxh8m6ey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f70bfe2292752888cf3f7b904322fbaac87807

**$QQQ** if the market trend is bearish after CPI while everything will fall, the biggest losers will be tech stocks. I will be loading QQQ puts here if the market sentiment is bearish

https://preview.redd.it/jkqz99xey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6738acf2da414a7382de7c54aadaa97540ba9ab

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

  
**$NFLX -** This play is only valid if the market trend is bullish, we have a $100 gap to fill from here. We have been channeling between $217 and $249 for the last 2 months, sooner or later this gap will fill. Once we break out of the channel, the gap could fill in 2-3 days. We have 2 scenarios for when the gap would fill, but both would require the market trend to be bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/j1i6s9fgy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1406fe8ebea6c658e3baf944283f9791c14a2936

1. The market is bullish starting at CPI all the way through FOMC, we can see the gap fill
2. We get great earnings on 17Oct and gap fills

In all cases looking at the chart, this gap is begging to get filled. This is a 10+-bagger opportunity, but market conditions will dictate the timing of the play.  If we dump on CPI we can revisit the play in October.

If the market is bullish, im getting Oct28 260c and Sep30 245c, even if doesn't gap fill, big market run should push NFLX up alot. Risk to Reward is excellent on this play, as long as it fulfils our criteria.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

Their watchful waiting in the electric car market, in my opinion, is going to pay off massively. I do not necessarily agree ethically with this company or other monopolies like it, however, the relative stability of the investment, even though it won’t return 280% in a year, I believe it can be even more attractive than punts and other gambling activities, especially when you combine it with other consequential trades like a $TSLA short.

1586,1661267031,wvr5ds,1,"Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users' personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.

The disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform's central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company's senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter's serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.

The whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter ""Mudge"" Zatko, who was previously the company's head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter's leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users' data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don't have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk's attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk's claims).

After this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, ""We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.""

Elon Musk's legal team subpoenaed an Ex-Twitter head of security whistleblower alleging TWTR has major security problems and that it don't have the resources to identify the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to.

**Over the past two weeks, WSB tends to sticky more bullish posts than bearish posts. Both in general, and for BBBY.**

---

As a mod, I'm constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. 

As of late, the main complaint seems to be that I ""only"" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. 

So let's take a look at everything that's been stickied since August 5th, and see if that's true!

#FAQ:

Q: Why since August 5th? 

A: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. 

Q: (I don't know, I'll add some more questions from the comments when they come)

---

#Methodology:

I took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.

I don't think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I've included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.

---

#Results!

Overall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.

#Conclusion

This was fun to put together and only took about an hour. 

I was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. 

I'm curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.

There are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. 

This is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)

Another limitation is timing. I think it's fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.

Despite the title of this post, I'm a fucking retard and don't know the first thing about telling stories. But due to recent events, a spark has ignited in my ape heart to share this tale with those of you who may find it one that is enjoyable, laughable, nostalgic, or dare I say another crayon to add to your 24-pack to replace the one you chewed on all day today. This post will contain my own story as well as media from the time period it takes place.

Though this may be my first post on WSB, I have been here for a few years. I do not claim to be a veteran or historian. I discovered this sub at the beginning of COVID. I was sent home from college, told in 2 weeks we'd return to finish the semester, only to later graduate from home and online. 

At times I've watched you retards from afar, losing hundreds of thousands on ridiculous 0DTE SPY calls and puts. I laughed along with the majority of the community at the ""loss porn"" though this was not all I'd witnessed. I saw you fuckers making mad money long before Jim Cramer on $TSLA, $NIO, $PLUG, $PLTN, $ZM, and many others. A healthy influx of tendies was bringing attention to this community of helmet-wearing degenerates. You all certainly caught mine, and I decided to join.

I soon began my first real job in May of 2020. I also began my first investment account. I worked in the engineering field. With a decent wage, booming economy / stock market, and being incapable of spelling the word ""inflation"", I soon began making sweet gains off of everything I'd invested in. In the first 5 months I'd turn $15k into around $32k. Rookies numbers by the book of WSB, and fairly so. I rode beginner's luck to the end of the rainbow, where I would soon find King Crayola himself, DFV.

Now we all know the way this story ends, and so you may wonder why I use the Lord's name in vain. But in the beginning, there was no light. There was tinfoil. There was disbelief. There was Wendy's applications being DM'd (probably). AND... there was conviction. Stronger than any man's I'd seen. DFV's calls were an unstoppable force, his shares immovable objects, his hands made of DIAMOND. No matter what anyone commented, he knew what he was doing. What he did not know, was the quite literal GLOBAL phenemenon (can one of you fuckers tell me how to spell this word) that was about to begin.

\*\*\*\*\* Here is where my WSB story begins.

[Half man half ape](https://preview.redd.it/jcjkvts5rki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126a05f9712c6e273b47501ae1aaf302f91df733)

Before they were referred to as ""meme stocks"" they were just tickers that were booming. $GME had made a ""steady"" but explosive run from around $4 to just under $40. A 1000% increase fueled by what... a float short of 141% if I remember correctly? And despite what any of you may say, this was the core. DFV's bet on $GME was that the shorts would get burnt, that the amount of shares shorted was over the amount even available. In WSB terms, shorts r fuk. And once WSB as a forum opened their ape brains to this idea, it was like archduke franz ferdinand had just been assassinated. A world war was brewing between the untied nation of retardation and Melvin fucking Capital. And many, many others would join the war soon.

&amp;#x200B;

As I sat at my desk job having just thrown my entire investment account into $GME, I'd officially gone full retard. Literally, I couldn't fucking get shit done at work to save my life. I'd just seen about half my year's salary in unrealized gains in a couple hours. I was an excited and anxious mess, glued to my phone like peanut butter flavored weed to snoop dogg's tongue. And so the rollercoaster of emotions had started.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd seen $80k turn back to $38k in TWO HOURS. I am 23 bro. What the fuck is going on?! I make it through the day of work having accomplished shit piss and lunchtime. I spend my night reading WSB posts, when I see this comment:

[These words by u\/BigChewyBuns reverberated in my soul.](https://preview.redd.it/6dk5jbevuki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b18b4ace6c1936ed22f6b8b9b3fef07ba5b0e37f)

I decide that I will need some time away from work, so I take the week off. During this time we find many new allies joining our cause. Elon Musk, some billionaire indian investor, Dave fucking Portnoy who turned out to be a paper-handed bitch, AOC before the feet pics, and idk do you guys remember that weird Nordic guy on twitter? Kjetill Stjerne? He was there for a minute too. Enemies like Citadel, CNBC, Robinhood... those fuckers... they all rose and fought back as dirty as they could via media and even DISABLING THE BUY BUTTON. Never ever forget that. This is back when Ryan Cohen wasn't the main character btw.

And thus, through the power of people tapping their thumbs on their phones, to the tune of sea shanties and the Tendy Man (a WSB fucking banger), war cry meme videos of 300 Spartans, some LOTR posts where Gandalf says some inspirational shit to Bilbo Fuckbag, and actual billboards of $GME go BRRRR lmfao... it actually did.

Now there was a lot... A LOT that happened between these 4 pics. I watched myself lose over $100,000 in 10 minutes. Thegoatbro felt like thedumbfuckhobo. But in the end, we made some money. Which for WSB, is a pretty big accomplishment at times. Even given that fact, I had been defeated. My exit plan was thrown out the window, and to that I had blamed the WSB echo-chamber of ""HOLD THE LINE"" for a long time, though I do know it is my own fault. It hurt in every way possible to accept the mistake I'd made with $GME, but I accept it nonetheless. I have learned a lot about myself through this experience, and a lot about who I believe we are should we choose to follow or participate in this sub.

We are individuals. We are investors, whether we describe ourselves as that or not. Ryan Cohen made the best move for himself this week, and no one can fault him for that. We are retarded. Very retarded. We are apes, and apes together strong. We are not investment advice. We are not financial advisors.

1. First of all, if RC doesn't tweet tonight and the price continues to drop, he could be found in violation of the fiduciary responsibilities he took on after his March purchases which included multiple board seats. He could face massive fines/penalties, lawsuits or even prison time.
2. RC did not sell. We know that now. The fact that the market is not responding to that information leads me to believe that there sell of is a mixture of scared paper hands retards who cant read and computers.... that also cant read.
3. Look at the charts AH after the initial sell-off. It's a perfectly calculated buy/sell in a sequential wave with almost zero volume. Low volume + computers = pretty little patterns.
4. The people who really control the price don't have bloomberg terminals so the only market movers AH are computers circle jerking
5. RC cannot sell off his assets or options for another 30 days by law
6. If he were to sell today, his options are so OTM that he would barely profit. Why would he do that and then face fines/penalties, etc.
7. My call is $40 by EoW.
8. RC is likely not tweeting because he is concerned about SEC scrutiny that would come from any kind of social media post (see Elon Musk vs. SEC on TSLA)
9. These WSB regards need to be a little less regarded and practice their 3rd grade reading skills
10. WSB will be filled with panic sellers crying about how they jumped ship @ $18 after BBBY hits 30 -&gt; 35 -&gt; 40

I remember back in the day when this sub used to hype up actual good companies with a good future like TSLA and AMD. Then after the whole GME fiasco it's nothing but trying to squeeze shitty as companies. 

Listen the whole reason the GME squeeze happened so effective in the first place is because a lot of people actually believed in GME. GME was very undervalued with another console cycle coming out and not to mention video games are just cool and you can imagine getting creative selling things in a store that sells them. Now it's BBBY? I'm gonna be honest with y'all. I got in last week, I got the bag and I dipped. I've seen multiple post of people saying that they don't believe in the company but they are just there for the squeeze. A squeeze will never work that way! In order for a squeeze to actually squeeze people have to legitimately believe in the future outlook of the company because at the end of the day someone needs to buy those shares higher than the last person that bought them and so on. 

With that being said can I interest you in spreading the work about our lord and savior ASTS. This company is claiming to be able to link your phone directly to a satellite from anywhere in the world and give you service! That's right, you can keep checking your roobinhood accounts, watch porn, work from home from anywhere in the fucking world They do this by making big ass fucking satellites the size of a basket ball court which unfold in space like the fucking web telescope. If this tech is as good as they say it is it legitimately has the chance to 10x in the next few years easy. They are launching a satellite in a space rocket in the next few weeks so soon we will see how well this tech really works.

Some of the bear case for this stock: 

Satellite doesn't unfold properly cause delay of a year or more

The service may not be that great

FCC regulations due to it possibly causing interference with planes and shit.

Due to the risky nature of this stock it has a decent amount of SI as well. 

Imagine squeezing and actually good company that you wouldn't mind HODLing because it actually has a bright future! HOLY SHIT!

Anyways that's for taking the time to listen. Good luck out there in your trading and have a great day.

1646,1660260727,wm5oee,1,"So recently I’ve started seeing more and more of the “buy the shares, not options” movement, and the reasoning behind this is always along the lines of Options Contracts don’t effect the price. I know most of the people here today came along after the GME saga, but WSB is not supposed to be about getting together and pumping a stock, it was about finding good trades and going way past any sane risk management level to basically risk everything to your name on plays like weekly OTMs, or on earnings. 

Nowadays everything you see on WSB is heavily shitting on anyone who mentions anything other than what’s currently (dare I say “being pumped”). WSB was a lot better when everything wasn’t about the next short squeeze, and when one day it’s TSLA, then next it’s SPCE, and after that it’s AMD. The transition to focused pumping is killing WSB, no one is in it with you, it’s a free for all and always has been.

And don’t let my account age fool you, I only switched accounts, I’ve been here since u/wsbgod did his infamous dupe, and then u/deepfuckingvalue actually did what wsbgod faked.","Buy the Shares, not Options is the very anti-thesis of what WSB was supposed to be.",1.0,2022-08-11 23:32:07

1680,1660034216,wjy0aa,1,"Boys, 

I know why you're bullish. Bears are repeating what they've heard from their favorite Tiktok analyst about QE, how our economy can't handle 3%+, etc. When the shoe shine boy says the doom is here, inverse that fucker. But look, I looked. I looked at Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and your mom. I've got mom fetishes like I got 10-Q fetishes, and the generals--the kings of the Nasdaq? They're getting old. They had their best years. What do you think covid represented? The peak of technology. You think it gets better from here? AWS gonna keep breaking records? Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me ""the chicken comes home to roost."" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a façade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Enough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, ""but that's another topic"" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**

&amp;#x200B;

**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost. All the liquidity be sucked up, fed fund at 125 bps higher than today, and maturities of bonds without reinvestment**

&amp;#x200B;

 **You'll see, and it'll probably be after you do anything about it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Wish you all the best, but only a few end up with the bread in the end.**

Pre text - this is going to be a longer post. It comes down to I need some capital to fund a flip project for a side venture and I need to know which of my holdings/etc make the most sense to sell or leverage. Up top is the basic finances. Under is a deeper situational description. The purchase price is 130k due this Friday (5th) - the renovation should be 60k est and span 4 months. I currently have 70k at 4.25% variable with the market in a checking account.

My details:

30/single for tax purposes

65k/salary. around 4k take home after 401k/insurance etc.

I have side income via my other job (maybe 20k/year)

Living expenses

\-1170 rent

\-200 utilities

\-500 food

\-300 entertainment

Debt

\-2300 on a credit card (churning it for a bonus)

Assets:

Checking - 70k (loan at 4.25% variable)

Taxable brokerage (all have been held &gt; 1 year and get the tax benefits aside from maybe some shares here and there)

VTIAX 15K (+4000)

VTSAX 14K (+5800)

AMD 52K (+1600)

BABA 8500 (-4000)

CWRD 17K (-1600)

TSAL 250K (+62K)

Other holdings:

\-HSA 12K

\-401k 5K

\-Roth ira 48k (haven't contributed 2022 yet)

\-car and trailer for sale (9k and 10k respectively) - I have a buyer coming to get the smoker a week from now. Waiting on the car title and that will go quick as well)

\-other random garage junk I'm listing 3k

In total I am purchasing this house for 130k. We expect reno budget to be 60k and payment will be assumed for labor after each phase inspection/materials prior (I will be paying these directly).

I have to make a choice on what to liquidate right now in order to have the 130k in the bank for closing and payment on Friday. I currently have 70k sitting in my checking allocated for it.

I have a bunch of receipts for medical and could pull probably 5k out of my HSA or so. I will also have 20k in the next week and a half from a car and trailer sale.

In the short term I have to decide which stocks in my taxable to liquidate - obviously there is a bit more to say in this. TSLA is my largest hold and the biggest winner - HOWEVER the split vote comes up on Friday and I feel like I just can't sell this after holding it through ATH and through the future. AMD has been a love hate hold as well and I have trouble selling it with Q2 reports coming and they've been on the rise as well.

Am I crazy to sell my big loss leaders with a plan to repurchase after this flip? Worse that happens is I get a small write-off and lose some spread gains.

Also - as far as the 60k in labor/materials - I have a credit balance across multiple cards around 55k. I'm between funding most/paying it back via some of the asset sales/the 20k on the main assets could be used for this. Any arguments vs selling more of the taxable brokerage?

I just want to encourage who lost your savings and all your hard earned money in this rabbit hole market. 

I was/am a retard like you who listen to all the popular YouTuber and copy their moves. 

I used to FOMOed into AMC, GME, PLTR and some other random stocks and bought far out OTM 0tde options. 

I was down 90% of my portfolio 45K to 4K till last month. 

Today I reclaim all my life time lost by using only call/put credit spread trades. I only focus on SPY, TSLA, NVDA and other big Cap companies. 

There are some ups and downs during these time. But I managed to make it through. 

I didn't bet all at once on a single trade. I never hesitate to stop loss even if it's -80% or -90% loss of the trade if I believe it can go -100%. 

I placed the bet only if I am 100% confident and hold it until +30%. Then I cashed out half of my positions and let it ride until +50%. Once It hit over +50%, I liquidate all positions and look for another Trade. If there are some advarsed changes during the course of holding, I stop loss it.

1751,1658954025,w9p7jy,1,"This is an open source Platform i came across through a twitter post, called OpenBB. Which gives you access to the Data and tools previously us 99% of the retail market couldn’t get a hold of. This platform honestly rivals some of the Features the $24,000 a year Bloomberg terminal has to offer, and.. for free!

Download link: [https://www.openbb.co/products/terminal#get-started](https://www.openbb.co/products/terminal#get-started)

I’ll run through some of the features and how to use them briefly as it requires a little bit of Python knowledge to use it (although it took me just a day of using it to get to a comfortable level – having had no prior coding knowledge). For the smooth brains out there, follow the pictures and text and YOU too should have access to some of the data Wall Street has access to.

Tutorials

1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqGPK8OVHLk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqGPK8OVHLk)

So after installing and opening the terminal you will be shown the available options within the platform. (which as is tradition the Bullshit ones we’ll ignore)

https://preview.redd.it/ziuaz5dv76e91.jpg?width=1315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb39193a06c9dfa9b4ceb87fc79153cb12a5ac1b

All that needs to be typed is: Stocks (But the right hand column – gives a little rundown of the features available on each of the functions, which once you go to that menu will give more info).

We’ll start with options (OBVIOUSLY!!) just for an example TSLA and I won't go into too much information as I’ll leave that to you to have a nosey round, and get familiar. So to do so simply into the command line type stocks, once it’s loaded the next box, type load and the ticker name e,.g. \[load tsla\] again once the next box has popped up type options which should look like the picture below once finished. So,

1. stocks
2. load tsla
3. options

https://preview.redd.it/ph1n9qpw76e91.png?width=1330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f86f7ebe2b14f4930e44866d9f4b01e360eabd67

Most of the titles are self-explanatory so I’ll just put in pretty pictures instead.

Stocks/options/load tsla/ vsurf – is an interactable 3d model based on the volatility surface of the options based on DTE v the Strike prices v IV.

In the available expiration dates picture you can see all of the selectable options dates. To bring this up type:

1. exp
2. exp 3 (the number being the corresponding date you’d like) which will then set it

Again I don’t want to overload with information here this is merely just to show off some of the features and the fact that this is giving; software, data and functions only available to the rich players on WallStreet back to Retail traders to level out the playing field a little. So go Free and have a look yourselves, at the power of this platform! Take my word for it, it’s mind-blowingly good.

So final topic: the Stock feature - (I won't go into too many features this section has to offer and will mostly just cover the main pages as otherwise it will go on all day)

Another one of my favorites would be the Gov function (stocks/ gov/ load tsla) which allows you to see specific government activity based on all if (you didn’t load a ticker) or if you did on that ticker itself like shown below.

There's also a feature in which you can run a tickers chart against Jim Cramer's stock recommendations regarding the buy/ sell signals he’s given.

To have a quick check and see if he’s cursed your stock pick before you go ahead and buy those calls/ puts. Also you can set the timeframe you’re wanting (-s = start date, -e end date) such as:

1. stocks
2. load tsla -s 2019-01-01 -e 2022-08-01
3. ba
4. jctr

Quick rundown of the Tools:

The ability to export Data and pre-generated data to CSV, XML XLSX JSON

The ability to export any visual information and tables to PNG, JPG e.t.c.

In closing I just want to say this program has absolutely amazing features so many i could never be able to cover in one post nor some of them i’d even understand. and with it being open source new collaborators and functions will be from what i can see added all the time. I'm obviously no expert on this product, having only just come across it. But if anyone has any questions I'll do my best to answer them below.

I adopted Value Investing as my method of making money a few years ago, buying cheap good stocks at bargain price. ""Good"" means a company with at least a thin moat (and well known) while generate satisfactory earning growth and having a healthy balance sheet, 

Now, as I tried to find those stocks I ended up almost nothing on my shopping list. For example, I went to scan the Australian market for low P/E and low P/B stocks and occasionally some high dividend paying stocks. Those stocks that passed my filter are like cyclical commodities stocks with temporary high profits, another was a well known department store but with a history of exec misconduct and I left with nothing but the bunch of unknown small companies (yes, greater risk -&gt; greater return or nothing!) with swinging profit and some are highly leveraged. What a waste of time.

I tried with other developed markets such as Germany, Netherlands, France, ... but the results are appearing in the same way as in Australia, the bunch of unknown small companies. The good companies are always have a high multiples like $ASML, $MSFT, $NVDA, $TSLA. Those with low multiples are either commodities related or companies with shrinking earning forecast.

At this point, I start to believe that everything are priced in and the market is efficient in itself. Thinking about stocks as limited resources while there are new investors every year coming to find good stocks (and hold on for dear life) like me, and of course many of them are much advanced than myself and how in the hell am I going to compete with them to find such a good stock as most or all are taken. Shall I concluded that Value Investing are not working anymore? I don't even scanning the US market as I think there's always someone who monitor undervalued stocks using advance programming and take that opportunity instantly.

You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but this is true when it comes to availability in mathematics.

**Stock splits are to protect companies from sell offs and to provide a false sense of security.**

This is my logic for the above claim:

1.) Forget penny stocks for now. Stocks *in general* trade up to 2 decimal points, to the hundredths of a full number. 

2.) A stock trading at $100 before going to $0 has 10,000 leading prices that buyers and sellers can trade at before the stock is worth $0.

3.) A stock trading at $1000 has 100,000 leading prices that buyers and sellers can trade at before a stock is worth $0.

4.) A company’s current stock price is based off the last traded price.

*Assuming the company is not going bankrupt to $0 but the market is not doing well because of uncertainty, doubt, and fomo. You have the below.*

5.) At $1000, with 100,000 prices to sell at, people can get more competitive in selling.

6.) At $100, with 10,000 prices to trade at, there is less price action available.

How do you benefit from this in any way? 

High priced stock that has good volume and liquidity will sell down in bad times. With a stock split and a lower pricing, there is less volatility. Here’s a screener of high-priced stocks with average volume.

Jesus Christ… If that doesn’t tell you things are changing, then just go ahead and stick those crayons right up your ass and ass-blast away at a dart board to make your next stock picks.

At the end of the day, I don’t give a flying fuck which car company wins the EV arms race (and you best believe it’s an arms race: [https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment](https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment) ). I don’t even own a single horse in that race. You know why? Because I’m buying the god-damned horse track.

You know what every single EV needs besides an autist behind the wheel? A BATTERY, YOU FUCKSTICK.

What do you need to make a battery? Lots of stuff actually… but primarily? LITHIUM.

For those of you with less than a 3rd grade reading level, let me paint a picture for you through a few pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

EV sales are expected to nearly 6X from now to 2030 in just the US alone:

[See how the chart goes up? That means we need more batteries. Just in case, let’s go over this again. What do batteries need? LITHIUM.](https://preview.redd.it/vvteve6mesd91.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf071f095201fe135688d8e86ce64d8995deb561)

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s a projection of how much lithium we need to meet the EV demand:

[Notice how this chart also goes up? Almost like it’s related to the first one?](https://preview.redd.it/89nolvxnesd91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1db22399b53255b83322059888c718cff685a7ca)

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s how much lithium we’ve been making globally:

[I know this is going to be a lot to take in, but really focus here. The lithium demand chart up above was showing numbers scaled in 1,000’s of metric tons, and this one isn’t. Here’s an easy trick, pretend the numbers on this chart stop after the comma. There you go, you did it!](https://preview.redd.it/ekhh99aresd91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dfb03fa980bc72daf43b7e622eafd9d2f846233)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we’re on the same page, doesn’t it seem like we might have just a little bit of an issue here? I realize you probably dropped that community college economics 101 course mid-term after your dad said he was disappointed in you for puking on his basement carpet again while struggling through your 5th hangover that week… but even you, you scholar, probably took away one iota of understanding from the first topic of that class: supply and demand.

Alas, just in case you were distracting from texting that Sophomore in your local high-school that you wanted to hook-up with while the professor’s soulless eyes bleakly looked around the nearly empty room, I’ll just go ahead and show you how lithium prices have responded:

[Yeah, line goes brrrrrr. Now it’s hitting home, right? Lithium prices are up 10X since the start of 2021 and 5X since last summer \(important to note for below\). Side note: this chart is in CNY \(Chinese Yuan\) because China currently dominates the world’s lithium market, but that’s a conversation for another time. Long story short, the world doesn't want China controlling global lithium supplies.](https://preview.redd.it/e41lshctesd91.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7684f6c589979e73e450687deac4d71665a9d50)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've had some pictures for you to look at, hopefully that convinced you to buckle up and choke down that third Adderall pill so you can focus for the next five god-damn minutes and read the rest of this so you can pass out and yarf on your own carpet one day. Take that Dad.

There’s a couple last important things to note with the charts above.

1.)  Producing more lithium can’t be done with the flip of a switch. Most new facilities take a minimum of 5-7 years to be planned, approved, and start producing. Back in May, some window-licker over at Goldman Sachs wrote that he thinks the lithium market has peaked until 2025 ( [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf) ).

Here’s what just a few others had to say about that report:

\- [https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/](https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/)

&amp;#x200B;

But I mean Goldman’s is never wrong, right? They couldn’t possibly be releasing a report like this to sink the lithium market so they can buy more for less, right?? I mean if they thought the lithium market was going to tank for the next few years because of over-supply, they would never BUY MORE Lithium stocks right???

Yep, you guessed it. Straight from their most recent 13F-HR filing:

[This is their Q1 filing… I wonder what their Q2 will have to say when released…](https://preview.redd.it/zwpox5ayesd91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3365cae45ac8e4ac20dab84cf2eb781d80de6c5)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, while typically I try not to condone this kind of behavior, I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Window Licker himself to thank him for giving us the buying opportunity of a lifetime on many of these lithium stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

2.)  Lithium producers typically sign contracts to sell their product for a set amount of time (commonly one year) for a set price throughout the contract. So, going back to that handy-dandy lithium spot pricing chart, I want you to take a gander at about when that pretty little line went parabolic (hint: I fucking marked it). For those of you who are too lazy to scroll up or if you’re just unsure and want to double check your work: August 2nd, 2021. Hmm, that's about a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do with this information? We buy companies that produce lithium of course and we bet an unreasonable amount of our portfolio on it to boot. Now to the part all you shit-flingers will probably skip down to: “Just tell me what to buy already!” Here’s a brief summary on my lithium plays and my positions.

   
 

\- Albemarle ($ALB) – 50 Shares, two 8/19 $250C, one 8/19 $260C

o Earnings Call: 8/3 After Hours

o One of the world’s current largest lithium producers than has multiple lithium mines in production and several others projects on the way. They absolutely destroyed their Q1 earnings report and should crush it once again for the next 3-4 quarters at a minimum as profits from those beautiful new lithium contracts from last year start to roll in. They are also diversified (hard word, I know) and are involved in several other market segments, but make no mistake this is still a lithium play at the end of the day. Additionally, they are US based so they’re going to get some of that sweet sweet low-interest government money courtesy of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM).

\- Lithium Americas – 920 Shares, fifteen 8/19 $30C, nine 11/18 $30C

o Earnings Call: 8/4 Pre Market

o Massive upside on this company as probably the most intriguing junior lithium miner right now. Sure, they haven’t made any profit yet, but that’s a pretty fucking big “yet”. They are currently in the final stages of approvals for the largest lithium mine in North America at Thacker Pass in Nevada. Once this makes it through a final court case appeal this September it will be all system go on this project and I would bet my left nut that that will be the case here. I won’t get too far into this since I have written about it before, but there are several other catalysts on the horizon and revenues are coming very very soon. My PT on this one is $150/share by the end of 2025.  Massive upside here, don’t miss the boat. I’ll likely be turning some of my earnings play profits into many more 11/18 &amp; 2/17 calls.

\- Livent ($LTHM) – 300 Shares, two 8/19 $25c, thirty 8/19 $30C, five 8/19 $40C

o Earnings Call: 8/2 After Hours

o Another US based company with projects that are already producing. Major earnings beat in their last call and I fully expect them to blow it out of the water once again and for the next several quarters. They are heavily focused on being as green and sustainable as possible, which is an important factor in this field. I think we could see $40/share by early next year.

\- Sociedad Quimica y Minera ($SQM) – 50 Shares (No options…yet)

o Earnings Call: 8/17 After Hours

o More similar to Albemarle since they are well-diversified, but at the end of the day their lithium production is one of their biggest revenue drivers. I’ll probably write an article on them prior to their earnings so, I’ll just say I have option plays to come on this one as well.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Do you know someone who drives a car? Well odds are, At least one of their next two cars will probably be electric. Electric cars need lithium for their batteries.

DRAPER — A motorcycle rider died after being hit by a car on I-15 in Draper Sunday morning.

The motorcycle was southbound on the freeway near 15000 South when a Tesla hit it from behind about 1:10 a.m., according to Utah Highway Patrol.

The impact from the collision threw the rider from the motorcycle and the rider died at the scene.

The Tesla's driver told investigators he did not see the motorcyclist. The car's autopilot was on at the time of the crash, UHP said.

Automaker to part ways with executive Afshar: people familiar

    Omead Afshar, one of Elon Musk’s top lieutenants and the executive running Tesla Inc.’s Texas factory, is under scrutiny in an internal investigation for his role in a plan to purchase hard-to-get construction materials, according to people familiar with the matter.

    Tesla has already fired some employees in relation to the probe, and the electric-vehicle maker plans to part ways with Afshar, likely through a leave of absence initially, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Terms of his exit are still being worked out.

    Afshar declined to comment. Tesla and Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.

    The internal investigation, led by Tesla Acting Head of Legal David Searle, started after a purchase order for construction material was identified as suspicious, the people said.

    The order, for a special kind of glass, was flagged to Tesla’s finance and internal audit groups earlier this year, the people said. Investigators are trying to determine whether the glass was for Tesla Chief Executive Officer Musk’s personal use, people with knowledge of the matter said.

    Global supply chain disruptions have made the glass difficult to secure, but Tesla’s status as a global manufacturing powerhouse makes it easier for the company to acquire materials in high demand.

    Afshar had requested the purchase order be created and told the workers involved it was for a secret project, the people said.

    Afshar has continued to work at the Austin, Texas, plant this week, but is likely to take a leave of absence as the investigation continues, the people said.

    As one of Musk’s top executives at Tesla, Afshar has been in charge of overseeing the construction and then production at the plant in Austin, Texas. A member of the office of the CEO since 2017, his most recent job title was listed on his LinkedIn page as a cowboy hat emoji.

    Inside Tesla, Afshar was seen as Musk’s fixer, dispatched to smooth out kinks in the operation. In a 2019 interview at the University of California at Irvine, his alma mater, Afshar said he’d performed many roles at Tesla over the years.

    “I focus on where there’s a problem, so a lot of firefighting. If there’s an issue, that’s where I am,” he said. “Usually when people see me they’re not always happy, because it means there’s a problem.”

    Afshar graduated from UC Irvine in 2009 with a degree in biomedical engineering and a season’s experience as a ski instructor at California’s Mammoth Mountain, according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked for more than six years at St. Jude Medical Inc. and its acquirer, Abbott Laboratories, in product engineering and managing roles before joining Tesla, part of a cohort of young, ambitious executives handpicked by Musk to carry out orders.

    He’s been a jack of all trades ever since. In early 2021, as the US was in the beginning stages of a Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Afshar wrote to California’s lead epidemiologist to convey a Tesla board member’s request to assist with distribution of the shot. By this year, Afshar was in Austin, providing tours to potential recruits from the nearby University of Texas. He briefly appeared on stage at Tesla’s Cyber Rodeo event in April, receiving a personal thank-you from Musk himself.","Elon Musk's right hand man Omead Afshar has been fired by Tesla for allegedly procuring ""special glass"" for Musk's personal use.",1.0,2022-07-21 22:47:38

1786,1658423574,w4m35r,1,"So basically you probably knew this but the SEC allowed single stock ETFs like a week ago. TSLQ is one that shorts Tesla and the one I am mostly interested in. 

People have drastically underrated how much this changes things. Literally everything will be different in my opinion. People were saying this is just options with extra steps and let me explain why I think its not. 

First of all you can buy options on these for a massive discount. Let me explain:

Tesla options are very very expensive. 
If we look at a date like 8/19 (the first available options for TSLQ) we can see that the calls and puts are over 50.00 dollars so over 5k to buy them. And some are even more pricey and the further out you go (date wise) the higher cost overall.


TSLQ as you would guess are way cheaper. A lot of contracts still have yet to be filled (in my experience the lowest i was able to get was 2.00 for a contract that plummeted already) and 2.75 for one of the 0s. 


To me this will drastically change and will climb closer to the Tesla prices because these are again just a way to buy discounted Tesla options. For example TSLQ shorts Tesla therefore I have purchased puts (my positions are at the bottom) so really I basically bought calls on Tesla. Buying puts on a Tesla bear ETF = buying Tesla calls for much cheaper. 


The issue is that the trading volume is low which is because it's new in my opinion. Once people start realizing that you can do this and it is accessible in Robinhood I think the will go up to easily a 1:5 TSLQ to Tesla ratio. 

That's just my theory though and I put a lot of money into trusting it (a lot for me cause im broke, not a lot for many of you).



**TLDR:**
Buying puts on TSLQ (Tesla bear ETF) = buying cheap calls on Tesla. 

I am not betting necessarily that TSLQ will get to whatever I buy my call/put at I am betting that before it expires people will realize the potential and upside to these insanely undervalue things.

Wish I had more money I can take this risk with but I hope you all could capitalize on it. (Which also makes me money, obviously)
And again I am confident and am fine with taking L if I'm wrong but on the one that I'm down like -190 or whatever that is like 95% of what I put it. Not worried though

1794,1658348345,w3wdgw,1,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results. Stock is up about 4%.

**Earnings per share (EPS): $2.27 (adjusted) vs $1.81 expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Revenue: $16.93 billion, vs. $17.1 billion expected, according to Refinitiv**

Early this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 254,695 electric cars for the period ending June 30, 2022, showing 27% growth from the year-ago quarter, but an 18% decrease sequentially. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales Tesla discloses. Its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 93% of those deliveries.

Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and Covid outbreaks in China exacerbated ongoing semiconductor and parts shortages, along with other supply chain snags. Covid restrictions in Shanghai forced Tesla to temporarily suspend or limit production at its factory there during the second quarter of 2022.

CEO Elon Musk also lamented the high costs of starting up production at new factories in Austin, Texas and Grünheide in Brandenburg, Germany. During an interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a company-recognized fan club, Musk said the two new factories “are gigantic money furnaces.”

The CEO announced steep headcount cuts in June.

Tesla’s cryptocurrency holdings also likely declined in value substantially, depending on how the company traded them. Barclay’s analyst Brian Johnson said on Monday that he expects Tesla to record an impairment of up to roughly $460 million.

On the brighter side, Tesla recently marked a milestone with an employee posting on LinkedIn this week that the company surpassed production of 2 million vehicles at its Fremont, California factory.

According to a White House memo from June 28, Tesla also plans to “begin production of new Supercharger equipment that will enable non-Tesla EV drivers in North America to use Tesla Superchargers.”

Elon Musk made a good example of how Ponzi schemes can play out pretty well (because the business model is not flawed). The biggest advocate for TSLA was Cathie Wood, the most reputable Ponzi scheme creator from near history. The company TSLA hired Elon Musk (social media artist) with contracts that promise options if the stock market reaches some sort of price. No one was interested in EVs in that days. (he made a good job with the driving assistant)

The climate news media exuberance started. The world begins to die in 2060 if nobody does something. If we do not start now, the world will suffer severe, irreversible damage. These sorts of stories get the attention, because they are reasonable to the reader. The real attention happened in times of Corona. At this point the human experienced a ""spiritual relationship"" with the nature because he could not go outside.

The next part was the historic stimulus that reminded the central bankers of what they actually learned in school and how inflation works. All parts come together as the TSLA makes a profit. The investment world suddenly out of nowhere realized that EVs are the future despite the fact that in the past several companies tried the H2O and EV approaches but in the past, EVs weren't simply the trend. Sadly for them, they followed soon, and some competitors emerged (these are the people that ride the trend, make unlimited money, because of the euphoria, and do not care in the end). New companies with the goal to compete in the EV market. 

All of them and the tech sector took the money like a sponge with the simple story of the future and unlimited prosperity. The politicians and policymakers didn't warn, they loaded up and surfed on the money wave.

This was probably the last ride on a stimulus-Ponzi-wave in the mid-future. All the companies already made money from issuing new stocks, and all the people that exploited this period already cashed out. The future was sold, and this future is not coming. The real future will be the realization of how the economy really works and what damage it can cause to other people, nations, stability, and freedom.",The market and the underlying Ponzi schemes.,1.0,2022-07-17 00:27:01

1829,1657714871,vy1whe,1,"The company contends that Musk breached his agreement to buy it by not using “reasonable best efforts” to close the deal, and so has no right to bail out.

‘Increasingly outlandish’

Twitter filed a much-anticipated lawsuit yesterday as it looks to force Elon Musk to close his $44 billion acquisition of the company. Twitter argues that it has every right to do so under a specific performance provision in the deal contract.

The company, with the help of lawyers at Wachtell (which has also worked for Musk), set fire to Musk’s efforts to drop the bid, which it argued were more about the drop in Tesla’s shares and its effect on Musk’s wealth than anything else.

“Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,” the company said in the suit, adding: “Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.” (Musk has not responded to a request for comment.)

Here is what else Twitter said:

The company gave Musk everything and more on spam accounts, contrary to Musk’s claims that Twitter stonewalled his efforts to get the information he needed to close the deal. But even then, Twitter claims, Musk’s demands became progressively more irrational.

“From the outset, defendants’ information requests were designed to try to tank the deal,” the lawsuit reads. “Musk’s increasingly outlandish requests reflect not a genuine examination of Twitter’s processes but a litigation-driven campaign to try to create a record of noncooperation on Twitter’s part.”

Bots do not count as a “material adverse effect” that would justify canceling the deal, despite Musk’s claims that Twitter’s regulatory disclosures, which state that about 5 percent of its accounts are bots, were intentionally misleading. Twitter explicitly said in its regulatory filings that the figures were estimates. And Musk cited fixing the problem of spammers and bots as a primary reason he wanted to buy Twitter, according to the suit.

On April 9, the day Musk said he wanted to acquire Twitter rather than join its board, he texted Twitter’s chairman, Bret Taylor, to say “‘purging fake users’ from the platform had to be done in the context of a private company because he believed it would ‘make the numbers look terrible,’” the suit reads.

Twitter ran its business in “ordinary course,” meaning consistent with how it previously ran things. Breaking an “ordinary course” provision has gotten a buyer out of a deal before, notably AB Stable’s acquisition of MAPS Hotels and Resorts during the height of the pandemic. Musk accused Twitter of breaking its ordinary course when it, among other things, slowed hiring and fired two executives without telling him.

1841,1657537782,vwfsxn,1,"After months of negotiations, Elon Musk has officially moved to  terminate his takeover of Twitter, but the CEO has still sold around $8  billion worth of Tesla (TSLA) stock to make it happen. What is he going  to do with that money?

After Tesla went public in 2010, Elon Musk often said that he would be the “last one to sell Tesla stocks”.

The CEO periodically had to do it to cover his taxes after receiving large stock compensations.

That started to change last year.

In late 2021, [Musk said he would sell 10% of his stake in Tesla](https://electrek.co/2021/11/09/tesla-tsla-stock-crashes-elon-musk-starting-to-sell-brother-100-million-out/) if a Twitter poll would agree, which it unsurprisingly did.

The CEO framed the idea as pressure from the media and politicians about the rich not paying taxes on unrealized gains.

However, Musk wasn’t as vocal about the fact that he was facing a  giant tax bill regardless of his sale of shares, due to a large number  of stock options he needs to exercise over the next year.

Though the CEO did end up selling more Tesla shares than he needed to  cover his tax burden from the stock options being exercised.

In December 2021, Musk announced that [he was done selling Tesla](https://electrek.co/2021/12/22/elon-musk-sold-enough-tesla-tsla-shares-after-receiving-options/).

A few months later, we learned that he used some of that extra money from selling those shares to invest in Twitter.

Soon after, Musk announced a deal to buy Twitter and take it private.  The CEO again broke his promise to be the last one to sell Tesla shares  and [sold about $8 billion worth](https://electrek.co/2022/04/29/elon-musk-sold-4-billion-worth-tesla-tsla-shares/) to cover some of the equity needed in the deal.

Now a few months later, Musk has officially moved forward to  terminate his offer to buy Twitter after months of back and forth where  the CEO claimed that Twitter wasn’t being forward about data regarding  the number of “bot accounts” on its platform.

Now Musk and Twitter are expected to be embroiled in a long legal  battle over who is responsible for the deal falling through and who is  going to have to pay a $1 billion penalty for it.

In the meantime, Musk still has money from his Tesla share sales and  quite remarkably, he managed to sell his stocks basically at peak value  not once but twice:

Amid those sales, Musk has been making comments about concerns regarding an economic downturn.

In an email to Tesla executives last month, Musk said that he has a “[very bad feeling](https://electrek.co/2022/06/03/tesla-pause-all-hiring-cut-staff-elon-musk-bad-feeling-economy/)” about the economy.

## Electrek’s Take

Elon Musk fans with conspiracy theorist tendencies are going to have a field day with that one. 

Obviously, it would be almost impossible to prove, but the timing of  those sales is obviously incredibly convenient and the reasons he gave  for them are somewhat flimsy. 

One is vague public pressure about paying taxes, which super-rich  people with money tied to stocks only do when exercising options or  selling their stocks.

In his case, he absolutely needed to exercise some options, but he did indeed sell more than he needed to cover the taxes.

The second reason is to cover the purchase of a social media platform  that many industry analysts suspected would be extremely difficult to  pull off in the first place.

Now Musk, again who promised to be the last one to sell Tesla stocks,  finds himself having sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla stocks at  almost peak value right ahead of a global recession.

Now the question is: what is he going to do with that cash? Buy back  Tesla shares? Start another media company? Let us know what you think in  the comment section below.

Why should they purchase it? Especially when a crowd of worshipers (the potential buyers), hang on your every word and you’ve just told them it’s overvalued.

What if each and every one of these buyers decides “you know what, this guy is clever and fuck paying more than it’s worth, especially if I can wait and pay it’s true value in a few months time after the bubble bursts”. Suddenly demand dries up and the whole supply curve shifts, making used cars worth less. (Panic Selling WHO??)

Instead of saying **why** you can just lie and say “well I like this other used car, so I thought I’d sell this one so I could buy another” suddenly there is no blind panic, because you just want to buy another car, right?

/s

Upon sale of your used car you pull out on purchasing the other used car. Leaving you happy with cash in the bank and the used car buyer none the wiser. 

Now read this again, **instead of used cars at the peak of a second hand car bubble, it’s Tesla stock at the peak of the stock market bubble**.

We peaked in January, right? So if you take a good long look.. when did good ol’ Elon start selling shares? 

If I recall Nov, Dec 2021 and April 2022.. that’s pretty close to the market peak, or am I just retarded? 

I’m impartial to Elon. I know some of you guys give him the sucky sucky, some of you give him the “V”’s, but personally IDFC for your opinion, who asked?

But I do think it made sense for him to back out of the deal. He would have basically had an excuse both legally and from a PR perspective to dump a chunk of Tesla shares at the peak without causing wise spread panic and tanking teslas share price long term which would not be in his best interest. (He still holds what? $100b in Tesla stonks?) 

I think this was a smart move on his part. Twitter are just a ripe lamb for the slaughter especially with an obvious bot problem. Why even pretend you can deliver on something that is an obvious Achilles heel.

We've all read about the curses on sports teams when their owners do evil &amp; bad things. There is the curse of Billy the Goat [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat) that kept the Cubs from winning the world series for a 70+ years. Babe Ruth's [Curse of Bambino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino) kept the RedSox from winning the championship for 80+ years. And now we have the Curse of GME Stonk - If you bet against GME during the meme stock phase, you got trouble. Here is rundown of what has happened to the key players so far:
-- Gabe Plotkin, Melvin Capital. He shutdown the fund after suffering $billions in losses. He is looking for a job rn. Dude also has a stake in the Charlotte Hornets. Enough said.
-- Andrew Left, Citron research. He lost 100% of his GME short position and has since [stopped publishing short reports](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qbfn5tftymfw/Amid-the-GameStop-Frenzy-Andrew-Left-Calls-It-Quits-On-Short-Reports-After-20-Years)

-- Robinhood - Stock is down 80% and even a FTX Billionaire Bro declined to buy 'em
-- Vlad Tenev - Net worth down 90% and dude has been investigated by Feds and Congress. 
-- Citadel &amp; Ken Griffin - Last seen digging himself into a [deeper hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uzbkk8/after_robinhood_melvin_capital_now_ken_griffin_jr/)

Meanwhile in memeland: GME stock has stabilized, is doing a stock split and the company is moving aggressively with its growth plans. The lesson - don't bet against GME!

1855,1657374236,vv20je,1,"I know that some of you lost money and are mad at him about it, but Elon using Twitter as a bait to sell TSLA stock does not make any sense for the following reasons:

1. Elon started acquiring Twitter stock, before he  sold large chunk of TSLA shares, which was done for tax purposes according to him.

 2. Elon acquired the largest portion of the capital needed for the acquisition of Twitter by getting loans against his shares and attracting numerous high-profile outside investors like Larry Ellison and the Qatar state investment fund. He did not need to actually sell his shares to raise money.

3. Buying a company like Twitter requires extensive research and the use of a lot of resources (mainly financial). This was probably planned at least a year in advance, so the great oracle Elon probably did not have the chance to perfectly time his TSLA selling to maximise his profits. 

4. Do you actually think that a guy who tweeted that the  TSLA share price is too high cares so much about his shareholders opinion, so he will orchestrate a very expensive and time consuming operation that could potentially greatly harm his public and business persona, just so he will have an excuse to sell his TSLA shares? Musk has stated numerous times that the sole purpose for his accumulation of wealth is to secure the funding for the dream of his life, which is making humans interplanetary species. Couldn't he just have said that he is going to sell a small portion of his TSLA holdings for that reason? 

5. No, TSLA stock probably would not have crashed even if he did not state any reason for the reduction of his stake in the company. It is not like he sold 50 percent. Also, have you seen how devoted are the teslabros? 

6. No, you won't be able to sue Elon, cuz your calls expired worthless. One of the main reasons why founders and investors make their company's public is because financials markets provide them with great liquidity. 

I obviously can't say for certain why Elon decided to back out of the deal. My personal opinion is that he probably just changed his mind  in part due to miner setbacks like the number of bots on the site.

Musk made the offer like an idiotic retard, like the many in this sub. Having created Tesla and SpaceX, he believed whatever he touches turns to gold.

In a Monday note, JPMorgan trimmed its Tesla price target to $385 from $395, representing potential downside of about 41% from current levels. The call came after Tesla announced weaker-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries of 254,695 over the weekend.

Why?

Because everyone knows the numbers are going to be lower. They had issues with both the German and Chinese factories, and there are supply chain problems. This means that even if the numbers come in low, as long as they're not cataclysmically low, the stock will moon. Why? Because it's not as low as expected.

My predictions: one, the numbers are not as bad as expected and the stock moons. Two, the numbers are really bad and the stock goes into the 500s. Who cares? Then you can buy it at $500 and enjoy seeing it go back over $1000 when they get China and Germany back up.

1884,1657111447,vsp5z5,1,"A huge portion of trading in the stock market is dictated by professionally-run algorithms. So a few years ago, I had an idea.. what if I wanted to attempt writing my own? I figured a few people on here might be interested in the project, so I finally decided to post about it. I know I'm not the first guy to try algo trading on /r/wallstreetbets and I certainly won't be the last; but I'd like to share what I have and see what people here have to say about it. 

I envisioned an AI that that could adjust it's strategy based on collecting its own winning predictions and losing predictions, and improving/adjusting itself with that data - using a fairly simple neural network; just a [3-layer multilayer perceptron or ""MLP""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron), meaning there is only two hidden layers. I think I did end up with a pretty sophisticated program written on [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), a programing language that's great for data analysis. The system is currently just over 5 years old but really only started being profitable about a year ago, when I changed my strategy for training the neural networks. Rather than training just one neural network and hoping for the best or training many then trying to use ""ensemble learning"", I took the approach of training many at a time and paper-trading them continuously. It's the ML thunderdome: many may enter, but only one may trade. This happens every day and allows for higher accuracy to the current market conditions for each ticker. As a result, there are many different neural networks each finely tuned for one single stock. And the program as a whole uses them all to pick trades (either long or short) on dozens of different stocks. 

To break down my strategy further, what it does is: 

Feed pure price action into a series of analytics functions to collect important variables such as the

* 4-hour, daily, 7-day and 30-day high and low

* Time distance since price last crossed for each of the above

* 24 rolling VWAP, and daily VWAP since open

* Last daily peak and trough above and below current price

* And several others

The outputs are then normalized and inputted into the neural network, aiming to classify the current point in time as either a trough (a good buy period), a peak (time to short), or neither. The trades formed by the algo will be mean-reversion or ""counter-trend,"" meaning they would play against momentum. Each trade output would offer a stop-loss, as well as five profit targets which are based off of variables that are entirely configurable. As mentioned before, the code can be configured to specific stocks. So I've written it to trade the same 70 stocks, picked for their decently high monthly volatility; including popular names such as SNAP, TSLA, and of course GME. 

As mentioned before, a scheduled job runs once a day to constantly check for paper-trade profitability of every network. When the scheduled job runs, the bottom 20% of networks per ticker are destroyed and new ones are added. This keeps the system continuously tuned to current market conditions. Since every stock will have many competing neural networks trained for it, only the most profitable network per ticker to be used for trading. The size of each trade can be determined algorithmically as well, using [the Kelly Criterion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kellycriterion.asp) with the number of positions held at any given time also being a configurable value. Once the trade is suggested by the algo, the system is linked to my broker and is allowed to automatically buy and sell stock for me.

In theory, this should be able to work with stocks, forex and other markets as well. I've already let it trade for me for a while (yes, real money) with good results. In the last 365 days, there have been 569 short plays with 296 winners and 982 long plays with 537 winners. That's an overall win percent of 53.7%. Now to a lot of you guys, that might not seem like much. But considering this is entirely automated, I consider the fact that it's even above 50% as pretty decent.

Any suggestions? Thoughts or improvements? If people are interested, you guys can follow me and I could set up my reddit account (or a separate subreddit, twitter, discord, etc) to post these algo trades immediately as they appear. I'd like to tweak this to be capable of forex trading, option trading, as well as other functionalities. 

Tl;dr: I wrote my own AI-based algo for stock trading, and it's been doing pretty well. I wanted to share this with you guys and see if anyone's interested in this.","Revealing my strategy to algo trading, letting the computer do my bidding",1.0,2022-07-06 12:44:07
1885,1657032710,vrznzh,1,"It's not often you see swing timeframe bear setups in a stock like Tesla. In fact, it hasn't really happened like this pretty much ever. In my opinion, before the market can find a real bottom, we need to see Tesla **really** deflate. It's basically the trademark stock of the 2020 meltup, and all the other similar names are down 70%+. This setup might be the best odds at playing a major meltdown.

Also, I know you guys are all **extremely** gay bears right now, so I am sure you will get a kick out of this.

Still, keep in mind, a setup is just a **setup.** It means nothing if the entry trigger doesn't happen. So don't go opening puts today expecting a crash tomorrow. I am waiting until my trigger happens to enter puts.

Anyway let's get to it:

First we have the 3 year 1 week chart. Here we are breaking down this key purple trend that reached from the March lows. This was the first sign for me that the tide was turning, and an indication I wanted to look on the short side while we are below. We have to reclaim 822 to get that back. 

Also - take a look at that volume profile. Extremely thin, which is exactly what you would expect here. I mean, it rallied from 42 to 1243 in 3 years. This means price has absolute shit for support, and the wind blowing a certain way could really knock it down. 

Now let's zoom in to the setup in question:

Here we have a bear pennant on the 1 year 1 day chart. It's not the highest probability bear setup by any means. It also only has 2 reactions so far. Ideally, we bounce from 633 area once more, and reach back to the top of the pattern @ 741 or so. This would really solidify the setup and increase probability.

The breakdown point as of now though, is at 633. Using price levels from the higher timeframes, we can see the nearest plausible one is at 467 (although we could go much lower). That would be a 30% drop from the current price. **Remember to wait for a daily close below the breakdown point to enter.** I'm looking to take September 16th 450 Puts to play this.

1886,1657021361,vrvw22,1,"Tesla produced over 258,000 vehicles and delivered more than 254,000 in a second quarter heavily restricted by Covid and other issues, the company announced on Saturday.

In addition to the pandemic, Tesla's second quarter was affected by supply chain issues, and a shortage of parts. The numbers released reflect a 50,000-plus increase in cars delivered compared to last year's second quarter, CNBC reports.

Despite the increase, Tesla fell short of analysts' delivery expectations of 256,520 units, according to a consensus compiled by FactSet-owned Street Account. Tesla reported over 300,000 deliveries in its first quarter of 2022 — over 50,000 more units than its most recent quarter.

In China, Covid-related rules forced Tesla's Shanghai factory to limit operations, and supply chain issues were exacerbated by the Russia's invasion into Ukraine.

 The company plans to post the financial results of its second quarter on July 20, but Elon Musk admits production of new factories in Texas, California, and Germany have been costly.

""Berlin and Austin are losing billions of dollars right now because there's a ton of expense and hardly any output,"" Musk said in a May interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley.

* Total deliveries Q2 2022: 254,695
* Total production Q2 2022: 258,580

Delivery numbers, which are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, fell just shy of analysts’ expectations.

According to a consensus compiled by FactSet-owned Street Account, analysts were expecting deliveries of 256,520 vehicles for the quarter, which was marked by Covid restrictions, supply chain snarls, semiconductor chip and other parts shortages.

Last year, [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA) delivered 201,250 vehicles in the second quarter, its first time delivering more than 200,000 units in a three-month period. In the first quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered [310,048 vehicles](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022006034/tsla-20220331.htm).

Today’s delivery numbers represented sales growth of 26.5% year-over-year, and a 17.9% decrease sequentially for Elon Musk’s electric vehicle venture.

The company has soft-guided to around 50% average annual growth, long-term, depending on manufacturing capacity and other factors.

In Tesla’s first-quarter shareholder deck, the company said, “We plan to grow our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible. Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries.”

In China this quarter, Tesla had to shut down or only allow partial operations at its Shanghai factory for weeks due to covid-related public health orders. (FactSet noted that some analysts’ projections were excluded from the StreetAccount consensus if they did not take into account the Shanghai factory shutdown.)

Other supply chain snarls, worsened by [Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/04/16/how-russias-war-cut-global-auto-production.html), also impacted Tesla and the broader auto industry during the quarter.

Separately, Tesla is grappling with the high costs of building out and starting up production at new factories in Austin, Texas and near Berlin in addition to its Fremont, California and Shanghai plants. CEO Elon Musk has publicly lamented that the new factories are [costing Tesla billions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/23/musk-says-tesla-berlin-and-austin-factories-losing-billions-of-dollars.html), but have not yet been able to make enough vehicles and batteries to justify their costs.

Looking at the chart below of a more recent PA on $TSLA, we can see it's ""bottomed out"" in the low $600 range, bounced, and almost retested but hit a higher low. I don't particularly think that a low delivery number alone sends Tesla under $600, but I do think when they report earnings, if there is anything that is not absolutely perfection on their part, it will send this thing under $600... and then, after all the fan boys who held / bought in at $1200 freak out, send it down into the $400s.

1900,1656678564,vozp98,1," Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.76% bounced into positive territory in premarket trading Friday, going from an earlier loss of as much as 1.7% to a gain of 0.5%, after China-based electric vehicle makers reported strong June deliveries data. China is an important market for Tesla, as the EV giant generated 24.8% of its revenue from China in the first quarter, and 25.7% of its revenue from China in 2021. The stock's bounce comes after it had lost 8.6% amid a four-day losing streak through Thursday, to end the month of June with a 11.2% decline. NIO Inc. NIO, -0.64%, Li Auto Inc. LI, +0.60% and XPeng Inc. XPEV, -1.12% all reported big increases in June deliveries, both from a month ago and from a year ago, to continue a recovery after a relatively rough April.

**Tesla (TSLA) is up +0.46% pre-market today. This comes after China-based electric vehicle makers reported strong June deliveries data which shows a rebound in production and demand for electric vehicles in China after a Covid-19-induced lull:**

Li Auto delivered 13,024 vehicles in June, up from 11,496 deliveries in May.

XPeng reported 15,295 deliveries, up from 10,125 deliveries in May.

NIO delivered 12,961 vehicles in June, up from 7,024 deliveries in May.

**Listen Up,** 

I hate to interrupt while you are planning your wife's and her boyfriend's romantic getaway for the Independence Day weekend. With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: **Make some fucking money.** 

Before I share the trade of a century with you we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up. 

So get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let’s go. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1: The lore of the electric Käfer**

Spool back to the start of 2018.A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the “(not so) secret master plan” of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot harder and more complex than initially thought. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c

You know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to “fuck off” more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‘ll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting “Humans are underrated”. Heartwarming.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it. 

Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vapourware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5

When things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, this bombshell hit the wire: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b3f816b65fa17d6679f8689f76dd6ee767feb5b

If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it. 

Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3

The deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts**

We have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the “funding secured” tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, we are now going to war. 

As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful “luxury” car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver ssist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. They combine everything MBA’s are afraid of. 

* Insanely capital intensive 
* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008) 
* Humongous unionised workforces 
* Stiff competition 
* Razor thin margins 
* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation) 
* Supply chains longer than the river nile  

You get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years. 

No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are damn impossible. 

As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need. 

Famously, Railroads are really “Transportation” companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers. 

That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don’t need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA’s darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP. 

What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business? 

&amp;#x200B;

And cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can’t we? We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it.

If you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. FSD was going to work next year and don’t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins. 

Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.

Add a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a 99.999% stock based compensation plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. **EVER**.

Enter 2020. After a short rally into february, a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of normandy, this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.

Every person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something **BIG**

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: Liftoff**

Now with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard. 

**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee. 

So how do we fix the valuation? After we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3

Ingredients for any  good bull story.  Hype, momentum and FOMO. Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?

You bet! Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centrepiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. Bubbles burst at these G-Forces. 

This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.

Everyone, EVERYONE was buying calls, WSB was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls. 

Even Softbank bought calls. Usually the last stop before wonky unicorns raise their last round before going public or broken, decided to chip in. **And in a big way.**

Thank you for your service! Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was. 

All brought tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of 1TN+ USD. We gave back some of these gains but the valuation can still be described as “somewhat” lofty. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4. The short the short shorts short** 

I am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning. 

**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: “Never short Tesla”, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.** 

As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project. 

And as we have learned, the market really can’t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick. 

For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/avdawlazbx891.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eb3d58ef40909c7dd075e46685dc085633efe95

I am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Teslas remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market. 

So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market. 

This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market. 

They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/htjmpkm0cx891.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f7fca6267122a7dd07bbb022b4fdcc4011f7d32

Let’s try to read a bit into the recent clues. 

1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are “Giant Money Money furnaces” we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs. 
2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.
3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated. 
4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious. 
5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars. 
6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months. 
7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending. 
8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4. 
9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let’s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit. 
10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550. 
11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ⅓ stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now? 

This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to 200-400 within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking? 

* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow 
* Earnings are next month 
* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading. 

Ok, I am in. How are we playing this? 

If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, you are **TEAM “I might be early but I am not wrong”™** **Burry** , you buy puts. Depending on your personal risk tolerance 300 strike puts with 1 month DTE look about right. If you want to play it safe, LEAP puts for January ‘23 should get you going. This is where I am at. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Tesla's valuation might have a short term nosedive.** 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are **TEAM STAN** you buy calls because inflation is over and the price action this year was just a dip. Buy calls or shares, don’t bother me with the details. 

If you are **TEAM Retard**, you start selling puts on TSLA because the IV is nice and high and the price levels don’t look all the bad.

*The SEC found that between 2007 and 2010, Citadel used two algorithms to execute stock trades on customers’ behalf that gave investors a worse price for their trades, even when Citadel knew better prices existed elsewhere.

# Why that is stupid: 

 This unconventional mathematical method is extremely powerful in the study of stochastic process. Here comes the argument on Linkedin. ""Stock price can be seemed as a [Wiener Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process). Hence, we can use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price."" said a data science blog. Well, in order to be a Wiener Process, we have to assume the stock price is continuous in time. In reality, the market closes. The overnight volatility exists. But that is not the biggest issue here. The biggest issue is, can we really use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price, even a range or its direction?

The author offered a quite interesting idea. As he suggested, the first step was to run as many simulations as possible on [stochastic differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation#Use_in_probability_and_mathematical_finance) to predict stock price. The goal of simulations was to pick a best fitted curve (in translation, the smallest standard deviation) compared to the historical data. There might exist a hidden pattern in the historical log return. The best fitted curve had the potential to replicate the hidden pattern and reflect it in the future forecast. The idea sounds neat, doesn't it?   


Inspired by his idea, we can build up the simulation accordingly. To fully unlock the potential of Monte Carlo simulation, the ticker we pick is $GME (Gamestop), one of the best performing stocks.  


If we used Monte Carlo on $GME (From January 2019, to May 2022) we would think the stock price would be roughly what it was in the beginning of 2019.....Whereas in actuality the black line shows what the stock did.   


&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's look at $TSLA. If we are to use Monte Carlo on $TSLA we would think the stock price is just shy of $1500 today...when in reality it's $676.59 at the time of this writing...it's more than 50% off.

1917,1656353965,vm23gv,1,"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications

TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain unlimited demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --&gt; $3750 --&gt; $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --&gt; higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain unlimited demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins.

TSLA can go to the moon in the next 1-3 month's. I know this because:

* The price crossed the 20 day MA (yellow), which is means the upwards trend is actually strong
* The MACD histogram (the bar thingies under the price box but above the RSI box), which is used for determining price movements, Is positive, showing us that the price should in fact go up.
* The RSI (Bottom Box) is above 50, which means there is upward momentum,.
* Even though the 50 day MA (Green) is at 770$, The 50 day MA is usually ignored by a trending stock's share price. This means that the markets will ignore the 50 day MA and instead go up to the 200 day MA (white), which is the exit point where I  will exit my positions

At the end of the week SPY broke through a several months old support trendline with fairly decent volume increases. From a technical point this is not a money making setup. No chart book has this pattern as a high probability of success trade. Ideally SPY would base for the next week and then try to stage a recovery. We will have to see how this acts with the Fed Chair speaking later on this week.

QQQ is looking slightly better than SPY. QQQ could be beginning to base as the lows of Thursday and Friday are still intact. However the overall trend is still negative.

However, although the indices are looking rough there are still some stocks potentially setting up. TSLA has a higher low setup that could trigger if it takes out Wednesdays high with volume.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, GOOGL also has a higher low setup that would trigger if Wednesdays highs were taken out with volume.

Overall it would be very constructive for the markets if this week was quiet and allowed stocks to find a base. There are only a few individual stocks setting up for high probability trades. IF they trigger positions should be stepped into lightly by staggering your buys. For example, if TSLA triggers only buy 20% of your final position size. This will limit losses if the market reverses. Please take caution this week and do not over exposure yourself to this choppy market environment.",Market Outlook 6/21/2022,1.0,2022-06-20 22:49:47

1946,1655520644,vewnyd,1,"TLDR: We rally next week.  TSLA to mid 700's and BA to 170s.  

After all the doom and gloom the past few weeks, bulls are looking for anything to give them hope.  Well, I may have some. I rode TSLA puts down on Thursday and hit a 5 bagger, now I've put those gains into TSLA and BA calls.  Here's why.  First off, TSLA:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qlzo431lga691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c3ca14fdcf0de62dfd8d83e4bf41b876f8d0cb5

The weekly chart shows a couple things.  First off, the MACD is turning bullish. Second, you can see that we're at an important level of historical support.  The 625 level served as support February 23, March 9 July 8, July 19, and July 27 back in 2001, and May 24/25 of this year.  We bounced off that number hard on Thursday and steadily climbed back to 650. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37kb9mndia691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44a50491883a4e98ef2aa72cb73f75a7cb2bcac6

On the daily chart, you can see a very clear double bottom that may be forming.  One thing to note is the rising RSI as the 625 low is being retested.  On 5/25, the RSI hit 30 as TSLA bounced off the 625 support level.  As we hit the same level yesterday, the RSI held around 40.  This RSI divergence is generally seen as a bullish indicator that more buyers are stepping in at this level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, BA:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/17h3czk7ja691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4568956497d14a66e709ab7558dfa8e987220bdf

The weekly chart shows that BA bounced of a significant historical support from the Covid era.  After hitting the low of 90 in March 2020, BA bounced to 186, and subsequently dropped to 115 a few weeks later, finding strong support there.  Over 2 years later, the stock found support at the exact same price, and recovering to a high 138 today. One thing to note is the volume. Almost 100 million shares were traded this week, more than the double the past couple weeks.  After the Covid crash, you can see that every time there was a significant increase in volume, Boeing ran. And when Boeing runs, it runs hard.  Additionally, you can see the MACD turning bullish.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ypnfh5snka691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89b85ae6d82e64bbb4e1194365f7e9beec4b8c65

On the daily, you can see a double bottom forming, similar to TSLA.  The RSI is trending upward, and there is a gap between 162-167 that will be filled eventually, and I think that'll be soon.  Volume is consistently rising as well.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I think that BA is a fairly easy stock to manipulate.  If you look at the daily chart going back to March 2020, some of the swings are absolutely insane.  Smart money has loaded up on calls, as you can see below.  The next 2 weeks have a very bullish option chain setup.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d67qvh72ma691.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaf5b83ea1554bb2f359852b1f9e1135543f500b

There was some significant call buying today at the 140 and 150 strikes for next Friday as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o2pei1o4ma691.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b5df0089b9ba9342e2f6370b1b82b4d81dcd7c

Maybe the market will continue to crash next week and we'll see more doom and gloom, but there has to be a decent snap back rally at some point where buyers step in, and I think these levels are where that will happen.  I don't think this is THE bottom, but it could possible be A bottom in the short term.

**Partnerships**

Confirmed Partnerships with: TC Energy, Univar Solutions, Iveco, PGT Inc Trucking, Fowler Farms, Walmart, Biagi Bros, Anheuser-Busch, Wagner CAT. (I’m sure I’m missing a few more) Together these companies have a Market cap of 444 billion dollars. They are all driving/testing Nikola EV Semis.

Walmart recently confirmed their partnership with $NKLA not too long ago out of the leaked document. It’s only a matter of time before the big news drops for the rest.

Another hint that caught my eye was the following tweet from Nikola themselves.

**NKLA institutional ownership Activity**

In the last 3-4 weeks there has been heavy institutional activity.

[Big Names loading the boat](https://preview.redd.it/b0m9p1y1c6691.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b3615cf106de72538a2e81600497bbe5e94b77e)

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the stock market taking a shit these last few weeks, $NKLA has proven to be resilient. The stock has an all time low of $4.82. Even with recent recession fears, $NKLA has set really good support and the price just won't drop below $5 even though I wish it did to load more shares.

Of course there's also the risk of $NKLA going to $0 but let's be real those rumors are old. The Risk to reward is extremely high. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

If you bought 1 share of each company last year for a total of $1074.75, then today you've have $827.15! With a loss of 25%, this portfolio is doing just slightly worse than market indexes for 2022. 💸 💸 💸

Removing outliers (TSLA), we're down 83% to $187.85. As Warren Buffet says, some stocks can keep your whole portfolio afloat and thankfully TSLA is that stock and Elon is the levelheaded leader we need to go to the moon! 🌝🌚🌝🌚

**2. Watch futures 🔮** - After markets close, traders monitor futures markets, or ""Futes,"" to see how the market will perform the next day. After market close, I monitor Monster, Craigslist and Indeed because I'm been concerned about my future since my employer fired me for gambling all day. 🔮

There is a lot of information publicly available about Tesla, detailed quarter-to-quarter analysis and strategies discussion that I do not want to replicate.  


 **Who can challenge Tesla?**  
Infinite game. Can the competitors play the infinite game; focusing on the long-term vision, able to move fast with aggressive investment rather than meeting short-term profitability and share price expectations?  

Incumbents versus startups. Can incumbents win against startups when the industry is moving towards the early phase of a new S-curve? History shows that it is difficult.

Capital allocation. We need to monitor their capital allocation between reinvestment versus dividends payout and share buybacks. Tesla and the startups are all reinvesting as much as possible and not into dividends and share buybacks which the incumbents were doing pre-Covid.

We are still early. Tesla’s challengers can be one of the current companies listed in this post. The challengers may exist in the form of a partnership where they work with various best-in-class (Apple, Nvidia, Mobileye, Cruise, Waymo).

# If this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.

**Yep, and I have no idea what I'm doing.**

[**https://imgur.com/a/y6nvmyE**](https://imgur.com/a/y6nvmyE)

I took 60k out (I know right, taking gains).

Let's begin with how I got into investing.I was in AP econ in highschool and the teacher said somethin' about a ROTH ira and how it is tax free and it'll make you a lot of money. Read up on it, and you had to get a job (I would walk to work everyday because no car), and started investing in it when pandemic hit

Here's a breakdown of my principle to invest4k(first year working in 2019)19k(working 2020)

7k(unemployment benefits)

1k(worked one month in 2021)

12k(from parents to babysit, plus some tax benefits)

11k(capital gains in 2021)

10k(got another cook job in 2022 and quit)

Add that all up you get 49k.I don't know where that 10k went.

And I wasn't born into a rich family. To give background, my grandmother told me she only had 2 sets of clothes per year while she was in her adolescence years and my parents started with nothing coming into America. My parents really helped me because I usually ate at the restaurant I work at or ate their food at home. Sure they also bought me a car later on and allowed me to keep +80% of my net pay with rent and no bills.

NOW LETS TALK ABOUT PLAYS (that made me money)

I played a lot of UVXY(17k)and SQQQ(9k). Shorted Netflix(5k) during earnings. Shorted ETSY. SPY calls. Tesla puts when TSLA was at high 900's. Spy puts and random shit. I just sold when it was green, and sold when it was red and not heading my way

Anyways, I have no idea what I'm doing. Never read a 10K--I've pet a k9 before though. Don't even really know what EPS is, PE, or even how to value invest.

The reason I am writing this post is to hold myself responsible for the 60k I took out and put it in VOO during the next bull run. And I said ""put"" and not invest because I have no absolute idea what I am putting my money into but supposedly it goes up and is boomerish.

Yeah not quite sure how I hit 57k in gains looking at this

1992,1654916722,v9ocsa,1,"The CPI sure hit it out of the park today, exceeding every expectation and destroying the notion that inflation has peaked already. Shortly afterwards, the consumer sentiment number came in at a record low of 50.2, down 14% from May. The FED meets next week and apparently 75 basis points may be on the table (it should). Oh, and the first big chunk of assets from the FED's balance sheet is going to roll off on the 15th, resulting in god-knows-what reaction in the bond markets?

The economic turmoil is just getting started and there doesn't appear to be any signs of things changing. Looking over the CPI report, the numbers are way worse than even the headline number suggests. May came in at 1% m/o/m, signaling that double digit inflation may be in our future. The food category was up 1.2% for the month and many segments are showing mid teens increases y/o/y. A third of the overall weighting of the CPI is shelter, which is ridiculously underreported at 5.5%. Average rents have gone up 15% and home prices 20% in the last year. What would this number look like if properly calculated???

Consumer sentiment has always been more of a ""soft"" economic number, given that it is based on feel rather than hard numbers. But a decline that puts the figure below both 2008 and 1999 is nevertheless  startling. When you add anecdotal evidence to the equation it becomes even more real. Layoffs, hiring freezes and recinided jobs offers are just a portion. People are pessimistic about housing purchases, gas prices and energy costs, to name a few. The thing about sentiment is that it can become powerful enough to actually change the more hardened economic numbers. If people feel that everything is more expensive, they may feel poorer and spend less as a result, even if their budgetary reality is not as bad as it seems. It can become a self fulfilling prophecy.

And then there are the financial markets. Despite the recent beatings that most financial instruments have taken since the end of last year, QQQ and SPY are still about 20% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind that we are currently in a highly inflationary period at the start of a rate hike cycle, with the FED beginning to unwind its massive balance sheet, unlike pre-pandemic. There still appears to be a lot farther that asset prices can fall.

The reason that these issues aren't going to go away anytime soon is due to (my new favorite term) ""excessive savings."" This term has popped up quite a bit recently and refers to the amount of savings that households have compared to the pre stimulus days. Most projections put this number in the $2 trillion range. It's funny that higher savings rates are now viewed as an economic problem. On the one hand, it is this cash that has helped spur the inflation that is currently devouring purchasing power. On the other hand, this ""excess"" cash is going to keep inflation higher for longer as people spend down their savings until they reach a level of discomfort that causes them to pull back.  That may take awhile. 

To add one more ingredient to the shit sandwich that we are staring down, how much leverage is there actually being employed in our financial markets? We all got a deserved laugh at Bill Hwang blowing up billions using ridiculous leverage in his opaque family office dealings.  His mentors at Tiger Global Management are down 50%, making one wonder what type of risk they have on their books. Elon leveraged his TSLA shares to buy Twitter. Michael Saylor from MSTR leveraged a balance sheet full of fake internet money to get loans to buy more fake internet money. The big guys are doing these types of things, but what about the small fish?

There was a hilarious post the other night about someone who sold their house and instead of paying cash for the next property, they put a big chunk in stocks and took a margin loan against their portfolio to pay for the place. After 5 weeks of declines, they were facing a $250k margin call that they couldn't meet.  Who knows if this is even true, but we see actual examples of this stuff in the daily financial news pretty frequently with the big fish. How many little fish are leveraged to the hilt?

Long story short, we are facing historically high inflation, rising interest rates, quantitative tightening, plummeting consumer sentiment, falling markets and potential issues that haven't even come to light yet. What could go wrong???

Positions: Cash gang waiting for a decent entry (QQQ 250, SPY 350 at a minimum)

1994,1654907709,v9lr9k,1,"As all of you who have long traded TSLA know, TSLA stock price follows laws of numerology. In particular, it has strong affinity for price points like ""$69"", ""$1337"", ""420"" and let us not forget, ""$420.69"", which is the most powerful of these.

Because the board is going to do a 3:1 split, and because we know the shareholders will almost certainly support it, we can trade options in anticipation. 

Quite simply, a future share at $420.69 is thus $1262.07 in current value. The split sounds like it should be done by fall. So, the play is therefore to simply buy up November or October calls at $1262, or you could buy a bit lower to make sure it's ITM, call it $1200.

I made jokes about this last time, and everyone thought I was being a moron, but had I actually done the trade I would've made 100x because the stock did in fact rally tremendously LAST time this happened, and crossed 420. Because past results are often a prediction of future performance\*, we can expect TSLA stock to end up north of $420.69, since that is the nature of things.

Good luck losing money on this truly moronic idea based in no valid reasoning.
