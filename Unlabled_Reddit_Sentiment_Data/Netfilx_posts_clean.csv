# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

Last week was almost Perfect, we almost got everything on the watchlist right on the money, no one can get all their plays perfectly obviously so the weeks where we do is cause for celebration at least for me.

For Earnings, we had $ZM puts, $DE puts, and $BBY calls. All ran in the direction we hoped for 100%-200% plays, except DE.

As for economic plays, we only had FOMC minutes and as expected, we got a little pump. I have zero clue why anyone on Twitter and Reddit would be bearish on minutes for a meeting that already happened and we say a dovish statement for. But each to his own, we made our $$$.

For those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  
**Port % Change:** 1101%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts.

Cashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out.

Averaged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March ‘23 swing.

As we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.

So overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C

Man last week was sleepy but this week is FULL of data, SUPER IMPORTANT data as well. Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.

**GDP Q3**

So we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.

This month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.

With USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts

**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**JPow Speech**

JPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.

A lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.

I think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.

**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**PCE**

Now we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

I'm still long NFLX as long as it holds the upward trendline, if I see a clear failure of the line, will be exiting my position, but if it holds, will add more. From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.

**- AAPL Long**

Has been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target

https://preview.redd.it/dvy6evpymo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496a4a6a6a31afe0aae0c1fc2d20e095c13e4709

**- TSLA Long**  
We got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week

https://preview.redd.it/mstw3cizmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c6cc55ed54d5d42911f8bf050743b74e73df37

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

My 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move.

I’ll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.

If my assumptions are correct with this week’s events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i’ll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p

https://preview.redd.it/xr65x390no2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=416cb8e5a7401db4cc374a26d62efc4024460e4d

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on. 

Watchlist for downside: 

$AAPL, $CAT, $TR, $DE, $GS, $DJIA, $NFLX, $CMG, etc.

Will be rotating shorts around to lock in profits, reduce risk, etc.

Will also likely be increasing margin as my positions move in my favor.

**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**

Last week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.

For Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays. 

Our 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.

For those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014  
**Port % Change:** 1001%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, im currently have 

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C

And plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so its pull the account value down, i got alot of time on most these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on. 

We got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much.

As i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.

* Technology Services
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.832 &amp; Revenue $1.09B
* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

Right at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok

**- META Long**

Holding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this

**- TSLA Long/Short**

At major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering

**- COIN Long**

Crypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls

**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**

No 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.

Universal Studios (UVV), like all Hollywood studios they are out of ideas. Its all about the nostalgiabait baby. The gen x’s had their time with stranger things but now its millenials turn. And what better thing to bring back than Jurassic Park Chaos Effect? Look man, we all know Jurassic World Dominion was a fat sack of shit but it grossed $2 billion dollars. It doesn’t matter if the movie respects cannon or makes endless plot holes. Its motherfuckin dinosaurs baby! Jurassic World and Camp Cretacious are done, son. I guarantee that Jurassic Park Chaos Effect is coming. Spielberg won’t cancel it this time; he doesnt care about art, only money. But UVV isnt even the half of it my friends.

I’m going balls out figuratively and metaphorically on DIS and NFLX. There is no shortage of Florida Man characters to put Hollywood back on top with interesting new celebrities. I myself am going to audition to be the next stay puffed marshmellow man in the next ghostbusters remake/reboot/sequel. I’m fat, pasty and white sticky stuff comes out of me.  But this is still not the money maker….

You google the top ten profitable industries during a recession; I will be a gator fuckin crack head if that list doesnt say fuckin toys! We going all in on calls this december for MAT and HAS. Every 90’s kid was so pissed off when Kenner unveiled the Ultimasaurus right before Spielberg cancelled the damn show. Half of damn youtube is people making their own Ultimasaurus from current Jurassic Park figures. When Universal and Spielberg finally gives the ok; this toy is going to make us Lambo driving millionaires. But thats still not all. We got Ron DeFuckme Santez on our side. He’s going to make sure the crotch goblins keep coming. More kids means more of a reason to make toys. The end of Roe is nigh motherfuckers!

Ok so let's get this show on the road

We  absolutely crushed it! So missed $TWLO that was a bad play, $TSLA never  ran to $250 but some profit was made there, if you got out early (i  didnt). And $NFLX &amp; $PIN never triggered, so no play.

But earnings plays $CVNA $SQ $ROKU $ETSY $AMD (everyone thought this wouldnt run) $MRNA all were home runs.

Economic  events FOMC meeting went as planned too everyone said 75bps would sell  off, but it ran as expected, then we played the Speech as went along.

Watchlist, $DB, $SPY also played out as expected, so all in all good week!

11:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment

Obviously  all these are important, but the only one we would be interested in  playing would be the CPI day. You can play CPI day 2 ways

**Option 1:**

Wait  for the results, after the initial drop or jump, the day usually  follows the same direction, you dont have to guess, and you would make  the ALOT of $$ by waiting it out and picking direction after that. If  you play same day options, chop might kill your plays anyway. This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.

**Option 2:**  
Speculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody’s chart  below.

https://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d

So  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)

So that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed’s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  ‘’influncers’’ would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.

The  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  
Remember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much. So play accordingly.

**- $VIX Long**

Lot  of chatter lately about VIX big spike coming soon, while i personally  dont see it, the trend lines we drew 4 month ago, remain respected so my  play here, is if we break and hold $25.6 resistance ill take calls, if  that fails we are likely going back to retest the trend and likely break  it all the to $22 at which point i would take profits

First of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter.

\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META. 

META dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below. 

https://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23

First of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me. 

 :Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop. 

https://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms. 

**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**

1)Instagram reels fully monetized 

2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization 

3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.

4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.

5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again. 

**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**

IMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.

1) U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets. 

2) A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back. 

3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.

4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.

5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most. 

6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.

7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up. 

These funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well. 

https://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d

[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 17 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)

If the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead. 

TLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon.

15,1667496743,yl8umy,1.0,"Netflix's (NFLX) ad-supported tier officially arrives in the United States on Thursday.

The ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. — just below Disney's ad-based price point of $7.99 (which will roll out on December 8.)

""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.

The ad tier will feature an average of 4-to-5 minutes of ads per hour. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.

Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.

Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""

Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.

""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.

Launched in 2016, IIP is the first publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange to provide real estate capital to the regulated cannabis industry. The company's sale-leaseback program includes cultivation, processing and retail properties with carefully chosen tenants that are licensed operators under long-term, triple-net leases.

Over the last five years, IIP's stock has outperformed some of the most popular stocks in the world, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). That's not all, the company has been paying consecutive quarterly dividends to its common stockholders since the second quarter of 2017.

The San Diego, California-headquartered marijuana REIT is focused on well-capitalized and state-licensed cannabis businesses across all product types, targeting deals in the amounts of $5 million to $30+ million. Its standard lease terms last from 10 to 20 years, with initial base rents of 10% to 16% on total investment.

Among the company's lessees are some of the biggest multi-state operators like Curaleaf Holdings

(OTCQX: CURLF), Trulieve Cannabis (OTCQX: TCNNF), PharmaCann, Cresco Labs (OTCQX: CRLBF), Columbia Care (OTCQX: CCHWF), Green Thumb Industries (OTCQX: GTBIF), Goodness Growth Holdings (OTCQX: GDNSF), 4Front Ventures (OTCQX: FFNTF), Holistic Industries, Ayr Wellness (OTCQX: AYRWF), Parallel, and Ascend Wellness Holdings (OTCQX: AAWH).

As of September 1, 2022, IIP owns 111 properties comprising an aggregate of around 8.7 million rentable square feet (including approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet under development or redevelopment) in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

In its latest earnings report, the company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.9 million for the second quarter of 2022, or $1.42 per diluted share, and AFFO of approximately $60.1 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. It also paid a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per common share on July 15, 2022, to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2022, representing a 25% increase over the prior year's second quarter 2021 dividend, equal to an annualized dividend of $7.00 per share.

Here's how returns break down from October 2017 to the present:

Netflix is up from $200.01 a share to $295.72 for a return of 47.85%;

Google is up from $52.5 a share to $96.29 for a return of 83.41%;

Here's a situation I'm trying to wrap my head around.

Purely  for day trading purposes, when there is no intention of holding  overnight, we're often presented with a situation where we can choose to  trade Index / Index ETFs options or options on a particular stock we expect a higher percentage move from.  There might be relative  strength we can play off of in individual issues, but strategically, how do we best balance that vs the dramatic convexity possible with zero  days?

I was faced with this choice  last week trading SPY options or NFLX and feel like this is a topic  where I could improve my understanding, and therefore, my results.

I  think this must have to do with the size and probability of the  expected move, but that's going to interact with the options pricing.  I  know this has to do with the convexity and gamma, but I'm trying to get  my head around that in a way that's useful for real time day trading  (NOT scalping).

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice, I wish you all a very green week!","My Full Plan for this Week 10/31 + Challenge Update (7 Earnings Plays, 1 MAJOR Economic Event (FOMC), 5 Stocks &amp; 1 Lotto 10x Play)",1.0,2022-10-30 20:02:35
19,1667159565,yho3e3,1.0,"Hello ladies and gentlemen 

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  
In this post, we will cover

* $2k to $100k Challenge Update 
* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday. 

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:** 

https://preview.redd.it/44odj0uuyzw91.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a5b53106aa15a99fdaaeeebf17ff2c8e034a25

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes. 

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct 

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts. 

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain. 

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing 

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market. 

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium. 

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time. 

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows. 

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle. 

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now. 

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful) 

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain. 

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market. 

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen. 

But like i said we shall see.

First, PARA is a profitable, investment grade company that sells for .42 sales. PARA is priced like it's going out of business, but it's growing revenue. PARA trades insanely low due to hedge fund shorts, the other side of their long NFLX.

Second, Buffett might own 25% of float possibly, after this quarter of new lows. I'm guessing that 25% is the Buffett limit. He owned 25% of ABC Cap Cities. Buffett already had 13% at the end of last quarter. Between the shorts and Buffett, 24-36% of PARA shares are spoken for.

Third, PARA has about a couple of billion authorized for share buybacks. That we'll over 10% of the current market cap but call it 10%. So 34-46% of PARA shares would be spoken for if PARA did a share buyback.

The 11% that's short has no fundamental basis for the short. Moreover, with the slightest effort to buy back shares from PARA management, shorts might find a materially constrained supply of shares when they need to cover.

58,1664050647,xn2wn6,1.0,"The market is retesting the lows (SPY 362.17), expect a bounce of some kind. Might be for an hour, a day, or a week, but a bounce is coming. 

**Why would the market bounce?** 

* Markets don't move in a straight line, we have been going straight down since the Fed meeting 
* Shorts are going to cover (if they didn't already in the last hour on Friday)
* People who bought puts in the last 3 days since Powells speech are going to close them for gains now that they got the down move and VIX is elevated 
* When people close out long puts, VIX comes down
* 3 day rule applies: the third day after the Fed meeting is Monday 9-26
* People say ""the market doesn't bottom on a Friday"" so expect another gap down at open or the June 17th lows to be tested early in the AM 
   * The dumb retail traders who are late will read the news over the weekend, and the fear sets in, so they sell on Monday (in theory)
* In the last hour of the day expect a rally as shorts cover and figure that the down move is at least over for now 
   * ""They"" are going to want to sell their puts while VIX is still high - or close their equity shorts before the other guy does 
   * Once one short covers, another short is going to want to cover as well before their gains are wiped out
   * We all know what a short squeeze is, right?
* Markets hate uncertainty, but the big event (Fed speech) is over now
   * Uncertainty has been reduced 
   * All the other central banks just finished a global coordinated rate hike - that is behind us now 
* No more Fed meetings until Nov 3rd. Pow has been hawkish 3 times in a row now, ""rumor"" is he has to be more dovish next time right? Aren't we feeling the pain now? 
   * Buy the rumor they say 
* Oil died so that feeds into the ""inflation is coming down narrative"" 
* The last CPI was a surprise because people were expecting a ""better"" number
   * Now everyone is scared and is expecting a ""worse"" number so any data that comes in not as bad as expected, will send the markets higher 
* Rates on the 2yr and 10yr have been on a straight up rally, so it is more likely they ""revert"" than continue (at least in the short term) 
* At some point the cash sitting on the sidelines comes back into the market 
   * Remember everyone that sold the last few days? They didn't buy bonds (check the rates), they didn't buy gold, they didn't really buy ""safe"" stocks either - they went to cash and they bought puts. Cash gets spent and puts get closed

* Whenever RSI gets to these levels (orange circles), we get a major bounce
* The next trading range:
   * Spy 360 seems to be level we were fighting over in the past (red dashed line)
   * SPY 340 was peak before COVID (blue dashed line)
   * SPY 320 is the bottom of the level we were fighting over in the past (green dashed line) 
* The bear market range:
   * Red line = top of the range, good place to be selling 
   * Green line = bottom of the range, good place to be buying (or at least not selling) 

**Could we go lower?**

* The chart looks terrible, and all signs point to continued downside moves. 
* There is no ""macro"" reason why the selling would stop 
* The market hasn't completely priced in the current interest rate levels 
* The bond market doesn't seem to believe the Fed's projected terminal interest rate. Either the fed or the bond market will be wrong and change their opinion 
* Powell is in the bond market daily unwinding the balance sheet, that pushes up rates, and requires stock earnings to be further discounted 
* More companies could pre-announce downside revisions to earnings - FEDEX and Ford sent the market lower and more downside revisions are probably coming 
* Russia could use nukes 
* Natural disasters, food shortages and other macro issues continue to deteriorate and that will cause commodities to be in short supply, that means prices going up, which means inflation is going to go up 
* The dollar is strong and shows no signs of slowing down 
* Financial conditions are tightening and money supply is coming down - assets can't go up if money itself is going down 

**What should you do?**

* Don't buy calls: If you buy calls, and VIX comes down, you are not going to see the gains you expect, even if the market moves up. 
   * You will win on delta, lose on vega, lose on theta 
* Do sell puts: If you sell puts you get to win on three greeks: 
   * you win on delta, win on vega, win on theta 
   * give yourself 2 weeks of time to realize this bounce because it might not start for a few days if it doesn't start on Monday 
* If you like shares, then consider the tripple leveraged ETFs for a short term trade 
   * If you are capable of thinking past this week, get long on growth equities, but only get companies you can see being around still in 2 years (SHOP, NFLX, META)

Netflix's forthcoming ad-supported tier may cost between $7 and $9 per month, according to a report from Bloomberg. Netflix (NFLX) shares were higher Wednesday afternoon after a new report from The Wall Street Journal said the company expects its ad-supported streaming will reach 40M viewers next year.

By looking at the companies’ financial status, the companies’ ROE and ROA have improved in recent years. In the competitive streaming market, Netflix still has the most market share. With the 62% pullback this year, and the stock price stabilized after its FY22 Q2 earnings report, it is not a bad time to start to build the position in the stock.

66,1662897510,xbgory,1.0,"Hello ladies and gentlemen

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* Last week's plays and what I learned from them
* This week’s Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

There is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all this, so you can check that out if you don't like reading

Ok so let's get this show on the road

So we had 12 Plays Last Week in chronological order as they unfold

(2 No plays - 7 Wins - 3 Losses)

**$SPX dump at Open:** Went exactly as planned grabbed SPX next day puts  PM, on the pump, the market opened to a huge dump, 300%+ play.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$SPX relief rally:** Also as expected after the dump, SPX bounced off  390.6 level and as per the plan we closed my SPX Friday calls before JPow Speech at the 4000ish level, 150%+ play  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$DWAC** Was a little late on this one as it was 20% down in the PM already before open. Got in after the pop at the open, when it hit the 200MA.At one point we were up 50%. But news came out before market close that the vote was delayed and the sponsor will loan them the money for an extension causing it to pump.Luckily it lost all gains the next day PM and i still held the puts. It pumped after they delayed the meeting again and puts went to 0. I'm not done with this turd, will be back for it in October for the meeting.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Getting in late is one of the first obvious mistakes. Not following my rule for selling above 50% is the second mistake. Not taking a second chance to get out of my puts was the 3rd mistake. Will need to apply my basic trading rules more strictly, got swept up in 10x potential.

**$SAVA** Absolute beast ran 15% from where we got in, but I got leaps so profit is nothing too crazy up 30% so far, but green is green.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Should have added some short-term calls, as it was getting alot of traction on reddit

**$GTLB** Beat earnings, revenue &amp; Guidance, yet still dropped in the PM. No reasons for this to happen, but this is the nature of earnings. Recovered by the open, but offcourse IV crush took 50% off its value. Averaged down at the open. Then it ran, as it should have, up 8.5% where I sold for a small 10% profit. Better than being right and selling at a loss I guess.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Should have held longer, ran up alot more for the rest of the week up 20%+ from earnings, should have placed a stop loss and let it run

**$NIO** This was straight up a bad call, missed EPS and guidance, it ran after market open went up 3%, sold for 20$ profit. I GOT LUCKY, this was a bad call.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** I mostly relied on sparse options flow for direction, it has a low PPS, likely most action would have been in shares action, not options, which were clearly selling off.

**$GME** Bought puts on Tuesday, and it just kept selling off, was up 75%ish so had to take profits. Sold and rebought with profits after it pumped a little for earnings. Got killed on earnings puts went to zero, earnings missed as expected but pumped on FTX partnership  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Stock has lots of supporters who buy the stock on any kind of news, puts would have worked if they were long-term, as it should dump hard if the market goes down.

**$SPX Dump after Jpow Speech:** We got a dump at 4017ish resistance, where i picked up puts as per plan BUT it very quickly rebounded and kept going up till stop loss hit, made 50% on this one.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$DOCU:** Not much to say here, everybody was expecting a miss, but they didn't, puts went to 0  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$KR:** Beat earnings, didn't run too much even with a bullish market, made 15%, not bad  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$MSFT $AAPL** Took no plays, no triggers activated

Ok so now that we have last week wrapped up and behind us, This week is going to be pretty damn exciting with CPI numbers coming out, so we have to be prepared.

# Earnings this week that I will play

But before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time

How I play earnings:

* buy shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes
* lotto size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don’t go over 5% size on any earning’s play
* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad

So now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it

**Earnings**

**Monday 12 Sep 22**  
After Close - Oracle Corp. - $ORCL

* World's largest database management company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.07 &amp; Revenue $11.3B
* Unusual Options: The $75.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 1.37 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My play: Not gonna lie I can't decide on this one, data/chart seems very neutral, leaning more towards puts here, taking a very small position here.

**Thursday 15 Sep 22**  
After Close - Adobe Inc. - $ADBE

* Packaged software company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $3.334 &amp; Revenue $4.443B
* Unusual Options: $390.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 9.93 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 7.5% move on earnings
* The stock was down 14 days in a row, before getting a dead cat bounce
* My play: 23sep 395c going with the flow here on this one, with $DOCU beat, a beat here seems likely too

So this wraps up the earnings for this week, I bought last week this time to avoid high premiums from IV spikes, remember lotto size only

# Major Economic Events

We are going into CPI with a VERY interesting, very bearish SPY hourly chart. We are right at 200MA, we have a very overbought RSI, that remained overbought all of Friday, and we have a big gap that is yet to be filled.

https://preview.redd.it/9pu4yjw5y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa29a540e4f60fb1417966169bc801c324ecfdf

From a trend point of view, we are at a very critical level. For the market to continue its downward trend it needs to make a lower high here. If it breaks this level, this is no longer a relief bounce and we have a reversal on our hands.

https://preview.redd.it/gj2r0pu6y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f0dcede9e90b6e7e95dee8da72889f8679f952

From a technical standpoint, everything points to sell off on CPI print. If that is the case the game plan here are some scenarios and how to play them:

1. Good CPI Read: We can see a sell-off all the way down to fill the gap, cooling off the chart. Then a retest of the 200MA, trapping shorts and triggering a squeeze. In which case our first take profit target is 401.2 at or before the gap fills on the way down.After gap fills, We have the 21MA between the gap fill and 200MA, if it rebounds and breaks 21MA then we should switch to calls. If it fails to break 21MA and falls back then puts are still in play.
2. Good CPI Read: We can see a big sell-off Sunday overnight all the way to CPI red on Monday AM, to reset the charts and then pump back up. In which case we would just take calls after CPI read
3. Bad CPI Read: We can see a sell-off and a hard reject off 200MA like we did in August and a free fall all the way to the 50MA, in that case, I would place my stop above the gap fill level and move it down as we keep falling, first take profit target at 50MA

https://preview.redd.it/oosxz008y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e362e872c975517f0b17098a1c9c456a72bf8da

I don't see a scenario where we don't dump to reset the charts at the very least, that's why I took a starter position of Sep14 SPX 3990p on Friday. And will be religiously taking profits and managing stop losses.

The rest of the week is where it gets very tricky, why? These are the last 5 CPI reads and what happened afterApr. 12, 2022 (Tues) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week

May 11, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Jun. 10, 2022 (Fri) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week

Jul. 13, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Aug. 10, 2022 (Wed) - Pumped on CPI read day and pumped for the rest of the week

As you can see the data is very inconclusive, as matter of fact it seems to be alternating every month, so if this trend continues we should reverse whatever happens on the CPI read day, for the rest week. Offcourse this is not reliable so we won't be looking at that for direction.

Luckily since we are at pivotal levels, I expect an overall follow-through, last 2 CPI reads showed inflation decreasing, we are actually expecting, deflation for august at -0.01% read and the headline read of 8.1%.

https://preview.redd.it/6rpu4pfay7n91.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9550ccaa78dcb53e08ac18bd1a7f447271d2550c

At or below these levels and 75bps is off the table completely which is what the market has already priced in. Not only will we pump this week, but we will also probably pump for the rest of Q4 22, as fed pivots in Q1 23. If you see these numbers or below, you might want to get yourself some calls, cause we are pumping hard.

If you see anything above these numbers prepare yourself for a new low this year and load up on puts. We have:

**Monday 09/12**

08:30 AM CPI/Inflation Rate Aug

**Tuesday 09/13**

08:30 AM PPI Aug

**Wednesday 09/14**

08:30 AM Retail Sales MoM Aug  
08:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims MoM Aug

**Thursday 09/15**

10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment Sep

I'm leaning towards a drop and pump but no need to guess here, we have our levels and plays ready.

# Watchlist

**$NVDA** has a small gap to fill up to $149.8, if the market continues its run on Monday this gap could fill and would take Calls at open if the market is bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/bcw2djfcy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51cfd2ae890782af83646dc37af1807a10ccab08

**$TSLA** has been going sideways for a while now and we are at a pivotal level, should make a big move whichever way the market breaks, if sentiment is bullish and we can break $315 expect a move to $364 quickly. If the market is bearish, we go back quickly to 50MA, lose that and $207 is my next target

https://preview.redd.it/aq0zbuady7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360ce4bd6b83a37d3c174c140135fa6141854930

**$UPST** is another gap fill play to $30, that's a 15% move from current prices. Same-week calls would print hard if the market is bullish

https://preview.redd.it/ujxh8m6ey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f70bfe2292752888cf3f7b904322fbaac87807

**$QQQ** if the market trend is bearish after CPI while everything will fall, the biggest losers will be tech stocks. I will be loading QQQ puts here if the market sentiment is bearish

https://preview.redd.it/jkqz99xey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6738acf2da414a7382de7c54aadaa97540ba9ab

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

  
**$NFLX -** This play is only valid if the market trend is bullish, we have a $100 gap to fill from here. We have been channeling between $217 and $249 for the last 2 months, sooner or later this gap will fill. Once we break out of the channel, the gap could fill in 2-3 days. We have 2 scenarios for when the gap would fill, but both would require the market trend to be bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/j1i6s9fgy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1406fe8ebea6c658e3baf944283f9791c14a2936

1. The market is bullish starting at CPI all the way through FOMC, we can see the gap fill
2. We get great earnings on 17Oct and gap fills

In all cases looking at the chart, this gap is begging to get filled. This is a 10+-bagger opportunity, but market conditions will dictate the timing of the play.  If we dump on CPI we can revisit the play in October.

If the market is bullish, im getting Oct28 260c and Sep30 245c, even if doesn't gap fill, big market run should push NFLX up alot. Risk to Reward is excellent on this play, as long as it fulfils our criteria.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

68,1662852765,xb3bvr,1.0,"# Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) Undervalued? WBD

&amp;#x200B;

Warner Bros Discovery is a media-entertainment giant that has hit rough times lately, debt is concerning and they have not been profitable as of their last earnings report, but the company has some interesting numbers as of lately that could show it being severely undervalued. ( All sources for the information on the DD will be provided at the end of the post).

# Streaming and Box Office

&amp;#x200B;

This year has been great for WBD in this area, movies like The Batman or Elvis have crushed the Box office and have posted great profits for WBD. In the case of Batman the budget was of 200 million and box office 770.8 million and in regards to Elvis budget was 85 million and box office gave 281.4 million. Special mentions to Fantastics beasts budget: 200 million box office: 405.2 million.

In regards with the streaming services of HBO MAX and Discovery+, how will they manage to merge them successfully is still unknown but separately they have posted great numbers, they ended 2021 with 73.8 million users and as of their last earnings call that number has grown to 92.1 million subscribers after adjusting for 10 million AT&amp;T mobility subscribers. This has been shown on their quarter over quarter sales of 220%. This growth is much faster than any of the other companies in the industry (NFLX: 8.60%, DIS: 23.3%, PARA: 18.5%. Source: Finviz).

On the negative side WBD has had to scrap projects that didn't have good outlook like batgirl. This happened because they have to be picky when deciding what should go through because of their debt levels and protect their new DC movies that started successfully with Joker(2019) and The Batman (2022).

# WBD Gaming

&amp;#x200B;

WBD has had a great hit with its latest release Multi-Versus. The game has raked up over 20 million players as of August 22, this can represent a massive cash cow since it is a free to play game which might bring more and more people as it keeps getting popular. This can generate huge gains via merchandise and in game cosmetics.

The gaming division is also scheduled to release Hogwarts legacy on the 10th of February of 2023, this shows a growing outlook and if the games are successful WBD might expand onto the growing market of gaming with some of their most knowledgeable franchises. This division of WBD has overall grown 4% in revenue against the previous quarter with the release of Leg0 Star Wars-Skywalker Saga.

# WBD Networks

&amp;#x200B;

This division for WBD has grown 1% on their last quarter, and advertising revenues 2%. This growth has been explained because of strong sports and audience ratings. This sector is expected to slow growing due to the rise of the internet and unless they manage to get those services in there in some profitable way this sector of WBD might have some trouble, Zaslav seems to have a plan for this according to some interviews .

# Debt

&amp;#x200B;

The largest issue for WBD is their debt, WBD has pushed the lever up to concerning points. Their debt to equity ratio is 1.02, this means that they have more debt than equity which is concerning, specially when going into a macro environment with higher interest rates which means WBD is not going to be able to refinance. The positive side is that when looking at their debt schedule is that their average maturity is 14 years which shows there is time to pay off debt and the interest they have to pay for this debt is mostly under 6% and for their larger bonds is less than 5%.

Zaslav has urged how important it is to reduce their debt levels and they have managed to reduce some of this debt during the latest quarters.

# Ratios and comparison with competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

When comparing with their main competitors WBD seems to be growing faster and their valuation is much more conservative than Disney or Netflix for example. WBD forward p/e is of 11.45 which is a good ratio, their P/B ratio is of 0.58 which means that if you take WBD and sell it by parts you are getting more than what you are getting by market cap. Their P/S ratio is better than any of their competitors with the exception of paramount and in regards of their price/free cashflow WBD\`s is much better than the rest of the giants of the industry. The company that seems to be comparably undervalued by ratios on the sector is Paramount($PARA)

# What are insiders doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Insiders have been consistently buying WBD which may hint at the company being undervalued, they have specially bought after the last dip after their earnings report. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

If WBD manages to get their debt under control, their streaming servicies continue to grow at the same pace and the WBD gaming section is a success I see this company going long past the target price of 24.74$ per share, specially because the management has added compensation if the stock goes to certain levels in the next few years. I already own WBD and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years

# WBD 

&amp;#x200B;

Warner Bros Discovery is a media-entertainment giant that has hit rough times lately, debt is concerning and they have not been profitable as of their last earnings report, but the company has some interesting numbers as of lately that could show it being severely undervalued. ( All sources for the information on the DD will be provided at the end of the post).

# Streaming and Box Office

&amp;#x200B;

This year has been great for WBD in this area, movies like The Batman or Elvis have crushed the Box office and have posted great profits for WBD. In the case of Batman the budget was of 200 million and box office 770.8 million and in regards to Elvis budget was 85 million and box office gave 281.4 million. Special mentions to Fantastics beasts budget: 200 million  box office: 405.2 million.

In regards with the streaming services of HBO MAX and Discovery+, how will they manage to merge them successfully is still unknown but separately they have posted great numbers, they ended 2021 with 73.8 million users and as of their last earnings call that number has grown to 92.1 million subscribers after adjusting for 10 million AT&amp;T  mobility subscribers. This has been shown on their quarter over quarter sales of 220%. This growth is much faster than any of the other companies in the industry (NFLX: 8.60%, DIS: 23.3%, PARA: 18.5%. Source: Finviz).

On the negative side WBD has had to scrap projects that didn't have good outlook like catwoman. This happened because they have to be picky when deciding what should go through because of their debt levels and protect their new DC movies that started successfully with Joker(2019) and The Batman (2022). 

&amp;#x200B;

# WBD Gaming

WBD has had a great hit with its latest release Multi-Versus. The game has raked up over 20 million players as of August 22, this can represent a massive cash cow since it is a free to play game which might bring more and more people as it keeps getting popular. This can generate huge gains via merchandise and in game cosmetics. 

The gaming division is also scheduled to release Hogwarts legacy on the 10th of February of 2023, this shows a growing outlook and if the games are successful WBD might expand onto the growing market of gaming with some of their most knowledgeable franchises. This division of WBD has overall grown 4% in revenue against the previous quarter with the release of Lego Star Wars-Skywalker Saga.

&amp;#x200B;

# WBD Networks 

This division for WBD has grown 1% on their last quarter, and advertising revenues 2%. This growth has been explained because of strong sports and audience ratings. This sector is expected to slow growing due to the rise of the internet and unless they manage to get those services in there in some profitable way this sector of WBD might have some trouble, Zaslav seems to have a plan for this according to some interviews .

&amp;#x200B;

# Debt 

The largest issue for WBD is their debt, WBD has pushed the lever up to concerning points. Their debt to equity ratio is 1.02, this means that they have more debt than equity which is concerning, specially when going into a macro environment with higher interest rates which means WBD is not going to be able to refinance. The positive side is that when looking at their debt schedule is that their average maturity is 14 years which shows there is time to pay off debt and the interest they have to pay for this debt is mostly under 6% and for their larger bonds is less than 5%. 

Zaslav has urged how important it is to reduce their debt levels and they have managed to reduce some of this debt during the latest quarters. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Ratios and comparison with competitors.

When comparing with their main competitors WBD seems to be growing faster and their valuation is much more conservative than Disney or Netflix for example. WBD forward p/e is of 11.45 which is a good ratio, their P/B ratio is of 0.58 which means that if you take WBD and sell it by parts you are getting more than what you are getting by market cap. Their P/S ratio is better than any of their competitors with the exception of paramount and in regards of their price/free cashflow WBD\`s is much better than the rest of the giants of the industry. The company that seems to be comparably undervalued by ratios on the sector is Paramount($PARA)

&amp;#x200B;

# What are insiders doing?

Insiders have been consistently buying WBD which may hint at the company being undervalued, they have specially bought after the last dip after their earnings report.

# Conclusion

If WBD manages to get their debt under control, their streaming servicies continue to grow at the same pace and the WBD gaming section is a success I see this company going long past the target price of 24.74$ per share, specially because the management has added compensation if the stock goes to certain levels in the next few years. I already own WBD  and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years

76,1660225405,wlrqge,1.0," If Disney+’s subscriber growth is any indication, the rumors that the global streaming market is nearing saturation have been proven untrue.

On Wednesday, the Walt Disney Company reported that total Disney+ subscriptions rose to 152.1 million during the fiscal third quarter, higher than the 147 million analysts had forecast, according to StreetAccount.

At the end of the fiscal third quarter, Hulu had 46.2 million subscribers and ESPN+ had 22.8 million. Combined, Hulu, ESPN+ and Disney+ have over 221 million streaming subscribers. Netflix, long the leader in the streaming space, had 220 million subscribers, according to the most recent tally.

Disney shares rose more than 6% after the closing bell.

The streaming space has been in a state of upheaval in recent weeks, as Netflix disclosed another drop in subscribers and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a shift in content strategy. While Netflix expects subscriber growth to rebound, uncertainty has left analysts and investors wondering what the future holds for the wider industry.

Also Wednesday, the company unveiled a new pricing structure that incorporates an advertising-supported Disney+ as part of an effort to make its streaming business profitable.

During the fiscal third quarter Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ combined to lose $1.1 billion, reflecting the higher cost of content on the services. Disney’s average revenue per user for Disney+ also decreased by 5% in the quarter in the U.S. and Canada due to more customers taking cheaper multiproduct offerings.

Starting Dec. 8 in the U.S., Disney+ with commercials will be $7.99 per month — currently the price of Disney+ without ads. The price of ad-free Disney+ will rise 38% to $10.99 — a $3 per month increase.

Let's start off with the obvious fundamental thesis: Streaming is no longer ""the future"", it is basically the present. traditional cable continues its slow decline and streaming platforms are continuing to grow.

Traditionally $DIS $NFLX and $AMZN are seen as the big players in this industry and most others are considered small-fry. This dynamic is clearly visible if you look at the market cap of the major players compared to $WBD. Obviously $AMZN and $DIS have some other revenue streams factoring in but $NFLX at least offers a compelling comparison. Netflix has 220 million subscribers after launching in 2007 with a corresponding current market cap of $101B. $WBD by comparison has 100.8 million subscribers (between HBO max and Discovery+) and a market cap of $38.8B. The ratio of subscribers to market cap isn't too far off here, but what I failed to mention previously is that both HBO max and Discovery+ are less than 3 years old and still growing fairly quickly, while Netflix subscriber count growth is starting to slow down as we have seen over the past few quarters.

$NFLX is trading at a 19.99 P/E. $WBD is trading at a 9.55 P/E ratio. This is IMO a pretty ridiculous gap. $NFLX has been floundering for months. Prices are increasing, they are adding advertising, their ""fast laughs"" feature and gaming endeavors are complete busts. Their product is suffering. I don't say these things to imply that $NFLX is going to 0, I think long term it will stabilize at near current P/E. Instead what I am saying is that it seems backwards to me that $WBD is trading at such a low P/E considering its potential. It appears undervalued.

To speak a bit to that potential: $WBD is quietly and efficiently improving their product, improving their library, and unifying their UX (probably Discovery+ and HBO Max will merge sometime in the next few years). Most importantly, unlike Netflix, $WBD is sitting on an absolute wealth of quality IP. They have also publicly stated that they plan to try and keep costs low as they scale. If management can execute on their plan $WBD can conceivably quickly catch up to and conceivably pass Netflix in subscriber count and in revenue over the next 3-6 years.

So, $WBD is currently undervalued, how best can one capitalize on this information?

Personally. I would recommend stock. I currently have a small stock position in $WBD and I plan to add to it after their ER later this week unless something deeply concerning pops up. The reason I am leaning away from options is because with the recent merger between WB and Discovery there could be significant short term costs reflected on this quarter's ER. Pairing that risk along with the potential that we are in bull trap, I am steering clear from playing this earnings. For those who really want to leverage up I would at least recommend leaps in case this ER is a dud. Analysts have a median price target of $25 but long term I expect us to break above current ATH's before the end of the decade. I'd be more aggressive about my timing but with macro conditions what they are it's hard to be too bullish at the moment.

He eventually suggested having a gang bang with his friends and they all laughed at how pathetic I was while they all took my hole and some of their cocks were so big that my asshole was destroyed and had fissures and tears. I cried while getting raped and hated myself for crying because the sadistic bastards got more excited and went harder. I was in school getting extra shame piled on because the teacher would give me a hard time for taking extra time in the washroom because it hurt so bad to go after what he and his friends had done to me.

You wanted to get out of poverty so you bought options to try to save yourself. Your own desperation hurt you and made your situation worse.

Share the fucking tickers or fuck the hell off.

“I’m down 99%”. 

FUCK YOU! I want to be turned on. I need the details.

“I bought  NFLX calls hoping their earnings would exceed expectations just to find out that they failed earnings because they’re an outdated streaming service that isn’t relevant anymore and I would have been down 30% more if they hadn’t delayed the release of stranger things. I was at the mercy of my own financial situation and made terrible decisions as a result. I’m adding insult to injury by making this post so you degenerates can finger my sore infected asshole and literally rub it in and add extra cum to the bloody mess to make sure I get AIDS and am reminded of my suffering for the rest of my life every time I take my Truvada in the morning.”

FUCK YA!

So if you’re going to hurt yourself sharing loss porn…do it right.

Expose yourself properly so that we can see your wounds and salt them while pretending to care.

Put yourself one step closer to the loony bin or suicide. Let us push you one step closer just so we can hurt you right in the soft spots for our own gratification or so we can numb our own pain from our own losses by hurting you.

That’s what loss porn is.

Without the fucking tickers it’s just a loss tease and not real hardcore loss porn.

Fuck you. Give us the goods.

Cheers and may your suffering become insurmountable.

GME to the moon (empty promise) so we can see the above played out on a population level. Fuck ya.

102,1658262630,w32ogg,1.0,"Netflix (NFLX) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close as the company battles ongoing inflationary pressures, increased competition, and an uptick in subscriber churn.

The streaming giant's Q2 subscriber numbers showed a narrower loss than expected, causing shares to surge more than 8% in after-hours trading. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share were mixed amid the broader subscriber slowdown, in addition to increased pressures from foreign exchange with the dollar holding strong relative to other currencies.

Here are Netflix's second quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg:

**Revenue: $7.97 billion versus $8.05 billion expected**

**Adj. earnings per share (EPS): $3.20 versus $2.98 expected**

**Subscribers: Loss of 970,000 versus loss of 2 million users expected**

The streaming giant's anticipated loss of 2 million paying users for the second quarter would have been the worst quarterly decline in the company's history after the streamer lost 200,000 users in April.

Netflix's Q3 subscriber guidance of 1 million came in below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 1.9 million, although analysts have admitted that the second half of the year could see potential downside risks amid macroeconomic concerns.

105,1658239615,w2tmak,1.0,"Netflix announced today that it will begin testing a new ""add a home"" feature to charge users who share their account with others in select countries. The test marks the streaming giant's latest effort toward cracking down on password sharing. The test will prompt users to pay an additional fee if they use an account outside their household. Netflix will begin testing the feature in Argentina, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras next month.

In these test regions, each Netflix account will include one home where you can access Netflix on any of your devices. If you want to allow someone to use your Netflix account in an additional home, the company will ask you to pay a fee. You can add a home to your account by paying an extra 219 pesos in Argentina and $2.99 in the other test regions. Members on a Basic Netflix plan can add one extra home, Standard users can add up to two extra homes and Premium users can add up to three extra homes. Users in these test areas will have the option to control where their account is being used and remove homes from their account settings page.

""It’s great that our members love Netflix movies and TV shows so much they want to share them more broadly,"" said Netflix's director of product innovation, Chengyi Long, in a statement. ""But today’s widespread account sharing between households undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve our service.""

Netflix says this test expands on a similar feature it launched in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru earlier this year called ""add extra member."" As part of this test, subscribers are asked to pay extra if they are sharing the service with people outside their own household. The feature allows households to add up to two “sub accounts” for a fee that’s less than the cost of the full-priced Netflix service.

Netflix had said this solution doesn’t rely on location-based data, like GPS. Instead, it’s leveraging the same information it uses to provide its service today to its end users, including an IP address, device IDs and other information about devices signed into the Netflix account across the household. Through this method, Netflix can identify when there’s persistent sharing taking place outside a household.

107,1658149794,w1yzp8,1.0," Netflix (NFLX) reports Q2 earnings after the bell on Tuesday — and investors are bracing for impact.

The streaming giant said it expects to report a loss of 2 million subscribers for the second quarter after announcing an unexpected first-quarter subscriber loss of 200,000 users in April.

Netflix stock, currently trading at around $180 a share, has plummeted 70% year-to-date amid a broader market sell-off that's slammed growth stocks and fueled talk of a potential recession.

Here's the good, the bad, and the downright ugly when it comes to Netflix ahead of next week's earnings.

**The good**

**Ad-supported tier**

Netflix's upcoming ad-supported tier, coupled with a crackdown on password sharing, should help boost revenues as the platform grapples with a post-COVID slump in subscribers.

The streaming giant will partner with Microsoft (MSFT) to help roll out the new offering, which is expected to hit the market later this year (although some analysts think otherwise given Microsoft's lack of experience in the third-party ad tech business.)

Still, Wall Street is generally bullish on ads.

""Tapping into the $160bn global video advertising spending opportunity in the long term should allow Netflix to drive average revenue per unit (ARPU) growth with less reliance on consumer price increases,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne emphasized in a new note.

He added, ""In markets with high ad ARPUs, like the U.S., Netflix can offer a materially lower priced offering and unlock additional net adds without sacrificing unit economics. Advertising may also prove a consumer-friendly way to monetize password sharing.""

Swinburne, who lowered his price target on the stock from $300 to $220 a share, revealed that the bank will need to see net adds reaccelerate, in addition to signs of traction from advertising and password sharing monetization over the next 12 months in order to revert back to a $300 bull case.

All in all, the analyst said ARPU growth matters more than net adds, suggesting Netflix will continue to raise prices down the line, in addition to leaning on revenue generated by ad-supported.

109,1658086332,w1fd1k,1.0,"Alright assholes, here's some charts with a bunch of shit drawn on them and my take on what I'm doing leading into this week with regards to Earnings.

# Market Sentiment:

Let's start by taking a look at **CPC (Total Put/Call Ratio):**

https://preview.redd.it/oq7sbahsj6c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6bd823dd6a79053f9b43dad2eb0cb18b346f44b

Here we are seeing fear leaving the market BIGLY with a CPC below .80 now and dragging the average (light-blue line) down below .95. Note how the average also made a lower high just before this decline, coinciding with turmoil and indecision we've been seeing in the equities markets lately. What this tells me is money is starting to position itself bullish but since we had SO MUCH selling recently, it just takes time to turn the ship around.

**US Dollar:**

https://preview.redd.it/34mv5mmxj6c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8691b09a557892fd176963c56ef9a27bdb810470

On it's face, we appear to be inside of an uptrend, but closer inspection shows that this channel is expanding (typically a bearish sign). Pair that up with the bearish divergence in the RSI and SLIGHT divergence in the PPO, I think we see a pull back here over the next week or so. Do I think the Dollar is going to crash? LOL, NO... BUT we should see some relief soon.

**Bond Yields:**

We're still inverted on the 10's and 2's which is not a good sign for the financials, as we saw last week on earnings... The 10Y is still reacting from the divergence we saw a few weeks ago and as of now, I see no signs of reversal, BUT will be watching that potential head-and-shoulders / Triple-Top pattern that appears to be forming:

https://preview.redd.it/otjawkb0k6c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ffc753da3864ab840fe5e0d15aa92ec14474856

The current Fed Funds Rate target is 1.50% - 1.75% I believe which seems to be well priced into the 10Y BUT with a terminal rate target of 3.5%-4% from the Fed, the bond market still has some work to do. That said, with the declining of the 10Y, unless the technicals change, it really does look like the Bond market is pricing in a Fed pivot before EOY.

# Equities with Earnings:

**Tesla:**  
Earnings Date: 7/20  
Expected High: $778.70  
Expected Low: $661.70

https://preview.redd.it/b8uqm9e2k6c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84fa3acac456acea438693a203bc5e9764a3da7

Starting with Tesla, we're looking at the 1-hour chart because I'm only interested in trading this stock, not investing in it. We are inside of a pretty large bear-flag currently with the Options Market's expected moves at both the top and bottom of the flag. I can't tell you which way we break out of this flag but what I can see is bearish divergence in the PPO, not so much in the RSI where it just seems that we have a clear over-bought resistance line and bouncing off of each time we've hit it.

My plan is to let earnings play out and play against the Expected move, meaning if the market pushes it over or below the expected moves, then I'll be buying contrarian weeklies for it to fall or climb back into this wedge. **68% of the time, it works every time.**

**NFLX:**  
Earnings: 7/19  
Expected High: $218.77  
Expected Low: $160.33

https://preview.redd.it/qr1dql84k6c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=706cf751572addfec5e088a003d64d5f4ddbc273

I'm expecting a VERY negative initial reaction to Earnings for NFLX and a drop well below the Expected Low for the week where I will be waiting to B.T.F.D with Weekly Calls on this one. We have some pretty serious and well established Bullish Divergence in the RSI indicating that any dip will be bought pretty aggressively. Last earnings they stated that they were expecting another 2 Million subscriber loss for Q2 which I believe the market has already priced in but likely a lot of dip-buyers since then have forgotten about. When those dummies dump their shares, I'll be waiting.

**SNAP:**  
Earnings: 7/21  
Expected High: $16.32  
Expected Low: $10.98

https://preview.redd.it/stbluzd6k6c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa0edab8b4340b7974325cf1b7636ea252c7418a

I personally want to own this one long-term, especially at these prices. My plan is to sell some puts leading into earnings, strike around the Expected Low / support around $10.50. We're seeing some pretty well established bullish divergence in the RSI but not yet in the PPO though so this thing could likely drop lower. But as long as it's under $10, I'll gladly sell puts and acquire shares.

**AXP:**  
Earnings: 7/22  
Expected High: $150.96  
Expected Low: $134

https://preview.redd.it/fymrmd78k6c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d2be3683b371a52ea2a4784896c270705efe11

We're finally starting to see the Bullish Divergence playing out that's been building in both the RSI and PPO with Friday's price-action. With earnings print on Friday, I don't know if I'm going to make any plays or not BUT if price does drop enough, then I'll likely be buying the dip with some 7/29 calls. According to what we're seeing, spending, while slowing down, I think will remain stable because American consumers are dumb and will panic buy when Recession and food shortage headlines start running across the news tickers.

**TLDR:**  
**Expected Moves in price-action from the Options market have proven to be very efficient in the past, giving us a 69% chance of success when we use them in our planning. The technicals and market sentiment I'm seeing are all SCREAMING to Buy The Fucking Dip so that's what I'm gonna do this week. Keep a close eye on the bond markets because they're still very undecided on what their interpretation of Fed expectations are.**

Netflix has named Microsoft as its partner for its ad-supported service, the companies announced Wednesday.

“Microsoft has the proven ability to support all our needs as we together build a new ad supported offering. More importantly, Microsoft offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members,” Netflix COO Greg Peters said in a statement.

The “Stranger Things” streamer, which has been struggling to retain and add subscribers, announced in April that it was planning on rolling out an ad-supported tier after years of resisting the move.

Co-CEO Reed Hastings has long been opposed to adding commercials or other promotions to the platform but said during the company’s prerecorded earnings conference call that it “makes a lot of sense” to offer customers a cheaper option.

The offering has a lot of profit potential for Netflix as it works to sign up more users. In an effort to lure more subscribers, Netflix has increased its content spend, particularly on originals. To pay for it, the company hiked prices of its service. Netflix said those price changes are helping to bolster revenue but were partially responsible for a loss of 600,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada during the most recent quarter.

Netflix has been interviewing potential partners for the past several months, including Google and Comcast, as it prepares to launch the tier before the end of 2022. 

Unlike Google, which owns YouTube, and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal’s Peacock, Microsoft doesn’t operate a competing streaming service to Netflix.

Peters said the ad-efforts are still in the “very early days,” with “much to work through.”

Netflix is slated to release quarterly earnings Tuesday. It had previously warned it could lose 2 million subscribers during the second quarter. Netflix shares have dropped more than 70% year-to-date.

The new business is a boon for Microsoft’s advertising division, which contributes 6% of the software company’s total revenue.

The Bing search engine, where Microsoft picks up revenue by showing ads in search results, is not as popular as Alphabet’s Google, and in 2015 Microsoft exited the display-ad market as Aol took on that unit.

114,1657551227,vwkb55,1.0,"Netflix Inc.’s co-CEO says his firm remains the “global champion” of streaming, blaming the loss of 200,000 subscribers on inflation that’s prompted households to reduce spending.

Netflix Inc.’s co-chief executive officer says his firm remains the “global champion” of streaming, blaming the loss of 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter on inflation that’s prompted households to reduce spending.

“Every customer is asking the question of the value of a subscription in relation to its cost,” Ted Sarandos said in an interview with French newspaper Le JDD on Sunday. Netflix’s vision to “satisfy the consumer” remains intact, he added, citing the popularity of the new season of “Stranger Things.”

Netflix has been trying to bring costs under control as its subscriber growth slows. As part of those efforts, the streaming giant has laid off employees, including 150 in May and another 300 in June.

The company is “adapting to the slowdown in growth compared to projections” and is doing so “without limiting spending on content production, which will reach 17 billion euros ($17.3 billion) in 2022,” Sarandos said.

The introduction of ads will be global and make Netflix’s business model more complex, the co-CEO said, but will allow the company to attract customers who want to pay less.

Netflix now has more than 10 million subscribers in France, Sarandos said, compared to 6.7 million in 2020, the last time it reported the figure.

It’s investing 200 million euros in French content this year, including 40 million euros on films released first in French movie theaters. It recently bought the rights to stream Johnny Depp’s next movie in France, Bloomberg previously reported.

Still, Sarandos criticized an exclusivity arrangement with local cinema guilds that allows Netflix to show films only 15 months after their theater release in France.

“The appropriate time frame is a few weeks, not a few months,” he said.

Nearly 90 percent of its revenue comes from ads and another 10 percent are generated by data licensing, as they call it, which are custom services that are offered to corporations. Since its foundation, no executive has found another reliable way for the company to make money and that is bad, since its user growth is slow to say the least. Twitter tried to make some partnerships with TV networks in the past to generate more engagement, but that experiment was not very successful. The company's monetizable users grew by only 24 percent from 2019-2021 in the midst of a worldwide pandemic.

120,1656707414,vpa8o9,1.0,"Tesla is expected to announce quarterly production and delivery figures this weekend and it's expected to break its multi-quarter streak of record-setting results.   


Let's look at recent events: 

\- An extended shutdown of its factory in Shanghai.  
\- Elon's been unusually quiet, but has been warning of a recession for weeks now...  
\- Layoffs of 200 of the total 350 staff working on automated driving.   
\- IMO -- the proposed stock split is an attempt to keep the hype alive, and make it easier for retail to pile into the stock keeping the price inflated  


In 1Q22 Tesla delivered 310,000 vehicles. This is more than ANY previous quarter. 

Analyst are suggesting this quarter will see 281,700.

When I saw this graphic from Bloomberg, it reminded me of something that happened not too long ago. Netflix (chart below). I saw a post recently on WSB that was super long, and the OP was bearish on Tesla. I think OP made a few valid points, while Tesla has seen a bit of a hit -- it's still trading at quite the multiple.

While it would be really stupid to say...Netflix was \~$700 and then went below $200 $TSLA will do the same! I do think this could be something that causes $TSLA to take a hit, and a big hit. While it's fair to say analyst have provided info, and investors should be expecting a lower number of deliveries, and it's priced in.... I'm not so sure.   


Looking at the chart below of a more recent PA on $TSLA, we can see it's ""bottomed out"" in the low $600 range, bounced, and almost retested but hit a higher low. I don't particularly think that a low delivery number alone sends Tesla under $600, but I do think when they report earnings, if there is anything that is not absolutely perfection on their part, it will send this thing under $600... and then, after all the fan boys who held / bought in at $1200 freak out, send it down into the $400s.

My final big gripe is that I recently discovered that the once beloved Cathie Wood has published some of the models that are used by $ARK on Github. Now I'm sure they use several things, but one thing they used was a Monte Carlo model on Tesla that gave them a $3,0000 PT by the end of 2026. I wrote a separate post about why this is absolutely absurd. But the reason I bring this up is it seems like there are still people with unrealistic expectations here, and it has not fully set in yet that the price is way too high for current environment, I think it has a real chance to fall hard...and fast.","$TSLA to report deliveries for 2Q22.

**Citadel was also fined by the SEC for using algorithms between 2007 and 2010**:

*Citadel Securities, the market-making arm of billionaire hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin, has agreed to pay $22.6 million to settle charges that it misled customers about the way it priced trades, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday.*

*The SEC found that between 2007 and 2010, Citadel used two algorithms to execute stock trades on customers’ behalf that gave investors a worse price for their trades, even when Citadel knew better prices existed elsewhere. The SEC penalized Citadel for failing to disclose the use of those algorithms to clients.*

*“This affected millions of retail orders,” said Stephanie Avakian, the acting director of enforcement at the SEC.*

*Citadel neither admitted nor denied the findings.*

I’m back for another failure of a pick, and I’ve been eating ramen ever since. Let me introduce you to $BROS. What is $BROS

&gt;Dutch Bros Inc. operates and franchises drive-thru shops. It offers Dutch Bros hot and cold espresso-based beverages, and cold brew coffee products, as well as Blue Rebel energy drinks, tea, lemonade, smoothies, and other beverages through company-operated shops and online channels. As of May 11, 2022, it operated 572 drive-thru coffee locations across 12 states in the United States. The company was founded in 1992 and is headquartered in Grants Pass, Oregon.

Sweet. Here’s a picture from their [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001866581/000162828021018412/dutchbross-1a2.htm) and it’s what convinced me to invest in $BROS.

No way in hell that  $BROS down 40% the day after ER is now a couple weeks later close to recapturing a key level of $40 without something being wrong — that’s a better post-er performance than $AMZN $FB $NFLX $WMT $TGT. To recap, $BROS makes coffee …. specifically in Oregon.

$BROS since the ER tank has encountered $SPY death days, however, $BROS has been impervious going green each time. So yah, someone is being fucked on the other side.

The real shorts are in Hawaii right now smoking a bong and patting themselves on the back after destroying firm after firm for 7weeks straight - pure bliss. Bottom tickers are the shorts who wanted one last hurrah with $BROS and now scrambling to defend $40. These guys have been staring at their screen everyday since wondering “*why didn’t I just take the W and stop trading, I could be chilling right now instead of watching this shitco go up everyday.*” 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4u35hiljue391...*

Below you can see that $BROS can run 15%+ in a day for multiple days. For a stock with this behavior implied vol is low in the 50’s. Can also see defense at the $40 price level, a key one for $BROS. The screenshot below is from 5/27, as of today (6/1) $BROS has recovered right back to $40. The market is also more conducive now, ignoring FUD and just ripping everyday for no reason.

A better strategy for tracking Pelosi is to only copy her trades of companies headquartered in California and DC, because those are the companies that feed her that good good insider information.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wj7fw6k1z2391.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797e4676ae286a4e85c242f1a49e7c75fe8cfe25

**Background**

We all just wanna trade like Pelosi and ride that sweet insider information to glory. But as I noted in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uu6hc6/if_pelosi_cant_beat_this_market_what_hope_do_we/), Nancy has had a disappointing reversion to the mean after several years of outperformance. Did she get greedy? Was it a classic game of telephone where the information was distorted and led to bad trades? Is she human after all?? Who can say... But it's up to me to figure out how to get our dear Speaker back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

**The New Strategy**

If the opposite of Pro is Con, then the opposite of progress is... This is the kind of high level logic I used to determine where ole Nancy wen't wrong. Surely she's getting insider information from companies, but she has to mask that with some garbage trades (probably sourced from WSB). How can we identify  the good trades from the bad?

Location, location, location.

Pelosi is a powerful figure in California and Washington D.C. It makes sense that she would be connected with companies headquartered in those states. The tech giants of Silicon Valley and legacy companies headquartered in D.C. that keep Congress' pocketbooks full in exchange cost-plus government contracts. **So I made a new Pelosi tracking strategy that follows her trades, but ignores any companies headquartered outside California and D.C.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Results**

That's more like it! This Pelosi tracker is back on top with a 50% outperformance over the S&amp;P 500 in the past 2 years. Even with the massive drawdown to start 2022, Pelosi would be killing it in the market if she just stuck with the companies she's connected to.

And a lot of these experiences I've had with the same partner! It doesn't matter how long you've been with someone or often you do it.

I think what really makes the difference is getting into the proper headspace. Take the time to admire your partner. Feel that attraction. There have been moments where I've had to stop and thank my lucky stars because my partner is just so damn gorgeous I'm just about to die from desire. Take the time to explore each other. Sex is about the journey, not the destination. There are times where I've been intimate with someone where I didn't come that are still better in my mind that some crappy sex I've had where I did orgasm.

&gt; 
&gt; El cuerpo del ex fiscal Nisman fue hallado en el baño de su departamento de Puerto Madero
&gt; 
&gt; “_Vamos a cumplir nuestra promesa de matarte a vos y a tu familia_”, dice el mail que el fiscal federal **Alberto Nisman** recibió el 6 de noviembre de 2012 en su casilla. ¿Qué más había en el correo? Frases como:. “_Ya logramos que te apartaran de la negociación de la causa Amia y también logramos que Argentina arregle con Irán sin tu participación”._ Amenazas que recibió el ex titular de la **UFI AMIA** tras denunciar a la entonces presidenta **Cristina Kirchner** por la firma del **Memorándum** de entendimiento con **Irán**.
&gt; 
&gt; Los hechos posteriores son conocidos: la noche del 18 de enero de 2015 Nisman apareció muerto en el baño de su departamento de Puerto Madero, con una bala en la cabeza, unas horas antes de presentar las evidencias ante el Congreso. Y una cuestión clave persiste sobre elcaso Nisman: ¿homicidio o suicidio? “**Nadie en la Argentina cree que Nisman se suicidó**”, dice **Carlos Gurovich**, el periodista argentino y autor de _**Operación Pajarito**_ —que puede descargarse gratis por un mesdesde esta página o directamente en el sitio de Bajalibros.com— en diálogo con **Infobae Leamos** y pone el foco en el caso más resonante en la historia moderna argentina.
&gt; 
&gt; Conocido en las redes sociales como **@carloskalman**, el periodista da una respuesta **desde la ficción** a este interrogante que sobrevuela la causa del fiscal: fue asesinato. La novela narra cómo un agente local, Mario (cuyo alias es Iván), y una agente extranjera Zahira (o Ángela) son los que llevan a cabo el minucioso plan para deshacerse de **Nisman** y silenciarlo. Desde escuchas, **agentes de inteligencia**, intervenciones, sedantes y hasta la sincronización de semáforos, no hay puntada sin hilo en esta historia. Pero una _selfie_ en el baño de **Le Parc** puede delatar la verdad. Leer _**Operación Pajarito**_ es un llamado a reflexionar sobre los límites entre la ficción y la realidad.
&gt; 
&gt; [infobae](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/5MZBVCCGFJHNFPVIJCVKMTINQ4.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt; La novela “se mueve en línea muy fina de la verdad, la fantasía y la ficción”, dice **Gurovich** mientras explica por qué impacta tanto el libro desde la tapa: “Esta es la sangre de la bacha de **Nisman**”, señala. Con personajes que muestran la “decadencia argentina” y otros como “La Jefa” y “Big J.”, el libro recuerda que “la historia es mucho más compleja que contar que mataron a un fiscal”. “Es la historia de la **AMIA**, del acuerdo nuclear, de Irán, mucho ruido”, asegura.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gurovich** construye una trama verosímil sobre **qué pasó la noche del 18 de julio del 2015 en el departamento de Nisman** y agrega un recurso novedoso: códigos QR que recorren el libro, que redirigen a entrevistas y a siete informes que realizó junto a su colega, **Damián Pachter,** para el canal I24 news de la causa Amia-Nisman-Irán.
&gt; 
&gt; Pero la investigación del periodista logra ir más allá y pone el cuerpo. ¿Cómo? En abril de 2021 entró al edificio Le Parc y pudo ingresar al espacio de los aires acondicionados, y quedarse allí un largo rato. El espacio se convirtió en un “escondite posible para los personajes”. “A mí me asombró, **me hizo temblar las piernas**”, cuenta **Gurovich** cuando explica que verificó gran parte de lo que había imaginado sentado a 18 mil kilómetros de distancia, en Israel, donde vive desde 1978.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Espacio de aires acondicionados en la Torre Le Parc.
&gt; 
&gt; Y aunque el lector camina entre la delgada línea de la ficción y la realidad, el pulso se acelera a medida que la historia avanza. Así, el periodista argentino consigue hilvanar hechos de público conocimiento —incluso algunos que quedaron olvidados, como el cadáver calcinado de una mujer a metros de **Le Parc** — con elementos ficcionales, manteniendo la tensión hasta el final.
&gt; 
&gt; La novela incluye infiltrados en el departamento del fiscal, un **comando iraní-venezolano**, la colaboración local, las huellas y la información de los dispositivos borradas y eliminadas y una salida sin sobresaltos de la escena del crimen. ¿Cómo imagina esto? A partir de una foto que encuentra en internet, la de un falso suicidio. “Las imágenes que están delante de nuestros ojos y te permiten construir un relato”, dice **Gurovich**.
&gt; 
&gt; Más de siete años de investigación, numerosas entrevistas -una de ellas con el fiscal Nisman- y encuentros con **Lagomarsino** y **Stiuso** hacen de _**Operación Pajarito**_ una novela policial que interpela en tiempo presente. **Gurovich** ofrece una nueva perspectiva, “otras verdades distintas a la de Netfilx”, dice. El periodista define a su novela de forma contundente como “Desafiante, preocupante, intrigante” y concluye con una frase que no deja de repetir: “**nunca sabremos la verdad**”.

Fue acerca de la causa que está en este momento en trámite, que es la **causa Vialidad**, y hablando del fiscal actual, que está en el centro de la polémica, que es el **fiscal Luciani**, dijo “que no ocurra lo que pasó con **Nisman**, que se suicidó”. La frase “nadie en la Argentina cree que **Nisman** se suicidó” la dije yo. Entonces la pregunta es: **¿se mató o lo mataron?** Si se mató, con el auto disparo -como lo llama **Lagomarsino-** no tenemos mayores dificultades, se cierra la causa y chau; pero **si lo mataron, como dictamina la Corte** -que fueron dos personas, aunque no puedan probar la mecánica, y que a Nisman lo mataron por su trabajo y por las pruebas que iba a presentar contra los acusados en su denuncia- queda la pregunta, la segunda pregunta del millón, **¿cómo entraron y cómo salieron?**
&gt; 
&gt; —**Y ahí entra la ficción**
&gt; 
&gt; —Sí. Utilizo la realidad, hechos que han sido expresados ampliamente por los medios, por lo que se ha filtrado de la causa, para construir alrededor de eso diálogos de ficción, elementos de ficción y personajes de ficción. Ninguno tiene un nombre real, así que son todos de ficción menos **Nisman**.
&gt; 
&gt; —**La novela** _**Operación Pajarito**_ **está construida desde noviembre del 2013 hasta febrero del 2015. ¿Por qué ese período?**
&gt; 
&gt; —Hay una mención a un mail anterior que recibe **Nisman**, que es el mail famoso donde lo llaman “pajarito”, “te vamos a matar a vos, a toda tu familia, a **Stiuso”**. Porque en realidad, de todo lo que es la gran causa **Nisman**, lo que importa y que queda en el aire es ¿qué pasó la noche del 18 de enero en Le Parc y qué pasó con la mujer quemada que nunca nadie reclamó? **Jorge Asís** tuiteó al respecto luego del asesinato de **Nisman**, donde mencionaba que iba a haber otro cuerpo y que probablemente fuera femenino, de ahí nace la idea de qué pasó con la mujer quemada, y cómo es que una mujer termina quemada, calcinada, irreconocible a 100 metros de la casa de **Nisman**.

Hope we get Jessica Henwick back as Colleen. And Wards Actor, and all the loose ends. I wanna see Alice Eve as Typho Mary again. I want to see Daughters of the Dragon. And bring Finn Jones back but just make him a cameo and give us a new Iron Fist if they really want to though personally I think he improved in IFS2 and LCS2 with that one episode appearance. Just give him a better script. 

And Mike as Luke and Jessica Jones' og Actor. Please bring them all back. 

The fact that DDBA is 18 Episodes makes me truly believe its an attempt to bring back as many of the actors they can into that show and have it serve as a fresh reboot of the Netflix world which they could jump say was part of the multiverse.

D&amp;D talking piece was they can't do so many things at once, they are picking netflix. And most likely that's what Disney wanted the news to hear as well. Keep their name out of it.

We know by May 2019 before we even saw s8 (completely), Disney was already getting cold feet. 

But while most news outlets (part of the reason I am not linking any of them) all said it was rumor Disney wanted out.  The proof in the pudding is simple: you can't break a contract without penalties. You simply cannot amicably walk away on own accord from a giant contractual deal to do the next trilogy. 

And the argument that Netfilx presumably $200M deal would have been better than royalties and pay from an entire Trilogy for Star Wars is insane to weigh.

These things cannot be taken too seriously as they are trying to reach a wide audience with some vague reference to the Christian concept of Heaven and Hell, bad people go to Hell, good to Heaven but NOT delving into areas that are CHRIST-o-centric such as grace (where one could gain entry into Heaven by allegiance to a single select personage in spite of past wrongs).   In fact I do not think they specifically mention Jesus, certainly I do not remember seeing Him or even Buddha, Mohammed etc.   So They go off on their tangents in putting people together in what appears at first to be like a heaven like place but instead it is an elaborate ruse to torture them as they are instead in the BAD Place.  
  
Along the way it is discovered that the Good Place-Bad Place  is somehow busted as  too many people are going to Hell because they inadvertently do evil ie they buy a tomato that somewhere down the line was farmed, packed, delivered by exploited labor and the unknowing customer became a part of this system of exploitation by purchasing the produce,    
  
Hence the rules must be reweighed, which allows the group enough good merit from their previous adventures in the ""good place "" torture to enter Heaven.  But they get bored in the Good Place (Heaven in this show has lots to do but people nevertheless get bored) and they eventually move on to some other place, (??permanent death??at that point the series ends) yeah I did not think too hard about it , entertainment, not something that actually reflects what God has revealed in the Bible about Heaven and Hell.",0.0,2022-10-30 15:01:05

the ending for me felt like it undid all 3 prior seasons of work that Paige had done simply because Walter didn't tell her one little detail that didn't matter in the slightest to him, he told her that he went to the convention without her and b4 he could tell her he went with Florence she interrupted him so he left out that part until Paige found the tickets.

in his mind he was only going with a friend that liked that kind of thing since Paige did not, the fact that his subconscious mind saw Florence as his wife was explained, he had no love for her and for Paige to react the way she did made it seem like she never loved him in the 1st place which clearly wasn't true.

Sylvester reacting the way he did is totally believable though since he was in love with Florence and Walter had unknowingly made her fall in love with him and Tobi and Happy siding with Sly and Paige is even more infuriating since without Walter they would of never met and never been able to fall in love in the 1st place, it very much ruins the show that it doesn't have that next season that the final episode teases but doesn't deliver because the show got cancelled.",0.0,2022-10-25 13:00:30

Hulu, Netflix, and Prime were great downstream revenue for programs that originally went to broadcast or cable, but your $10 a month to those services was never going to pay for all of as the primary/only revenue source.

It was inevitable that each company would look to build their library, ideally with properties they already owned, add in some new content, and go direct-to-customer.

The only 3 streaming services I watch regularly are Disney Plus, HBO Max, and Paramount Plus.  And all together they are so much cheaper than my old cable TV bill that I consider this a win.

There are no official spinoffs. There are 4 anthology volumes though, of which 3 are currently available in English.

474,1669887006,0.0,0.0,,"From Value Investors Club:

&gt; The market is dynamic--but to me it looks like Netflix is going to be the only true global pure-play streaming businesses. Disney has several major technology and content challenges to localize the service and build daily/weekly engagement-which is the lifeblood of the business.

&gt; 1-Peacock--not sure what the end-game is, but this is unlikely to be a global business. and it probably will not be a scaled domestic business. hard to overstate the long-term competitive disadvantage of constrained domestic distribution.

&gt; 2-Hulu--domestic and not going to scale internationally----challenged ownership structure, brand identity. should probably be sold to Comcast or folded into D+.

&gt; 3-HBO/WBD--yesterday should be a rude awakening for any investor that believes that HBO Max is a global competitor. There was an admission that the software platform is deficient. They are pulling back internationally, especially in Asian markets and in parts of Europe. Combining Discovery and HBO because they own both does not matter to consumers. the main legacy drivers of cash flow are secularly declining businesses--(and they are refocusing theatrical/ content licensing which long-term comes at the expense of building a global DTC business which is where the best long-term economics should be). Several launches delayed until 2024-moving to a licensing model in some market which is going to drive audience to competitors. There is no appetitite to fund operating losses to build global sub base---NOT because it is not a good market oppportunity--but because the ownership team sees little path to generate return on incremental content spend given that they do not have the tech or operational capabilities they need to create a great consumer experience on every device-in every market--on every viewing occasion--for every customer. I think Malone/Co are optimizing this for a sale of this asset---they are not investing in its growth.

&gt;  the operational execution required to build and sustain a large and happy customer base remains vastly underappreciated because most people have not considered it and assume the underlying technology/streaming infrastruture is a commodity---but  over time--doing a lot of the little things right (when to release/how to market/how to structure payments/how to adapt UI mobile/how to allocate budget for new IP/licensed IP/-among many others/where to cache content to provide the best experience) should to lead NFLX to have monopoly-like economics (i.e sustainable FCF and return on content spend) vastly better than any competitor-----which also going to build a lot of optionality. Don't have to be the only business in the space to enjoy monopoly like characteristics if the business is a scale and operations focused business. they currently only paid platforms with games, interactivity, content for every member of the house every week across most verticals---and the next year-it should light the path to becoming the biggest and eventually the most profitable global CTV ad business given they have most variety of new monetizable content, best targeting, and 1B people in the ecosystem. 

&gt; 3-Paramount--sub-scale, no global brand equity in streaing. does not have the scale to compete in technology, volume, variety, and software-will eventually contemplate a sale after exhausting all other options.

&gt; Netflix's global scale--which allows for more efficient amortization of spend, broader supply base of content that can meet various needs around the world (export anime to Latin America/export Telenovela from LatAm to US) the volume of daily/weekly engagement that feeds data into the system to allow improvement in the UI/UX and performance, and the highly cost efficient financing of producing locally and exporting globally and the scale required to produce in-market local entertainment at scale that can attract a mass market audience (early here in India/Africa/SE Asia--but early is ok)---is very unlikely to be replicated. Amazon will have a large presence--but it is won't be zero-sum and focus should be an asset.

&gt; Have written before--Apple should buy NFLX rather than try to build the business whole cloth (to the extent that Apple views entertainment as a major area of focus) which remains true today. NFLX close to generating substantial FCF so less dillutive than a few years ago , Apple could increase exposure to recurring revenue, cement dominance in global streaming at high-end, reduce exposure to China, and buy one of the few assets in the world that could actually make a difference for a company as large as apple.

&gt; 7B entertainment consumers outside the US--to the extent there is a demand for premium content---this is Netflix's market to lose. risk are PW sharing slow to monetize/does not monetize, some retrenchment in global entertainment markets that restricts outside foreign ownership or places undo burden on content financing in local market (foreign growth markets become more hostile to US based entertainment companies--NFLX doing a lot to hedge this risk)--or a shifting consumer preference to other forms of entertainment that gradually devalues the lean-back passive form of entertainment turning it more into background ambient entertainment versus something that a lot of people value. But the competitive threat from peers (which is traditionally a constraint on growth and pricing power in most consumer markets--has been dramatically reduced)",0.0,2022-12-01 09:30:06

&gt; Netflix just hired two great ad executives from SNAP. Jeremi Gorman was the chief business officer and head of ads at Snap. She previously was at Amazon and helped Amazon build its ad business (run-rate of $30B). Peter Naylor was VP of ads at Snap and previously spent six years at Hulu helping build its ad business. These hires signal a real commitment to advertising.

&gt; As consumer television viewing time continues to move from linear to streaming-a trend likely to continue every year for many years, NFLX is well positioned to build and scale a profitable and defensible advertising business. NFLX has the biggest audience globally, the best targeting, by far the most vieiwng (7.7% view share in June more than Disney (2%)/HBO (1%)/Prime video (2.95)combined--this is tens of billions of hours more of viewing) the most variety of content against which to serve ads, the best tech talent in streaming, and it has growing advantages serving hard to reach, large audiences (Hispanic/Young Adult/ Asian-Americam/Cord-nevers among others) with premium content. Given the content budget should remain relatively fixed at $17B for the next several years, it is difficult to see how the advertising business would not scale at very high incremental margin to NFLX.

&gt; Netflix should be able to deliver advertisers one of the largest, most engaged, most valuable, and hardest to reach audiences in the world. Over time, the international ad business may be even better given that NFLX's competitive positon internationally is much stronger than competitors and there will likely be many markets where lower price point is going to expand the market.",0.0,2022-11-30 23:03:29
485,1669849220,0.0,0.0,,"From Value Investors Club:

&gt; Broadly, it seems like a good time for NFLX to launch a lower-priced ad-supported option. The value of home entertainment tends to increase in difficult economic times--and having lower-priced option should be attractive. The service continues to have the broadest selection of new content for the whole household-the best targeting, the best personalization-and the best UI--all good assets to build the ad business.

&gt; Media peers are highly leveraged (WBD: $55B in Debt/$27B Equity--Paramount: $17B in debt/$12B equity; Disney: $51b in debt/$174B equity/Comcast:$98B Debt/$133B equity)--vs. NFLX:$8B in debt/$100B equity). Peers are leveraged to cyclical, declining revenue streams -linear ads/pay bundle/theatrical. And peers are pulling back generally on streaming spend. most are unable or unwlling to fund losses. few have international scale-and none have the technology infrastructure required to deliver a constantly improving consumer experience across every device in every geography (appe/amzn separate). 

&gt; NFLX has a strong balance sheet best, the largest projected ramp of free cash flow againt a growth market (internet streaming), no declining legacy profit streams,  15-year streaming headstart, and what I think is a big incremental opportunity in advertising given that the budget does not need scale that much to grow the ad business over time.",0.0,2022-11-30 23:00:20

I like NVDA and NFLX, though they've already risen quite a bit from their nadirs. As cash flows back into riskier items, health care and utilities will underperform quite a bit. Style-wise, small and value looked amazing for a while, now plainly good. Growth presents isolated opportunities. Personally, energy is just a big ball of uncertainty now, and seems to have always been more contingent on geopolitics and weather than fundamentals. Internationally, I like most of the far east. Europe will obviously look good eventually, the question is where the bottom might be. I don't like bottom-timing so I have slowly added small hedged positions.

Netflix is the worst run studio in terms of economics, and has only stayed alive by virtue of the NFLX use of OPM and debt.  

Studios that need to live or die on advertising, or on distribution deals... they need to do this carefully, or they're done.  Netflix can afford to be wildly inefficient.  

Google's model is, to me, the best.  They pay according to success, period.  It means if something is wildly profitable for them, the creator also gets a windfall.  If it's not, Google doesn't payment the creator much at all.  It's an ideal model for this kind of business, and one which Netflix executives, if they weren't so incompetent, would have copied ages ago.

Imagine deals in which you only pay big bucks for guaranteed blockbusters, and you pay nothing for things that flop.  It's the holy grail.  And it's how Google's entire model operates.

'Why aren't you in jail already?' Internet erupts after Sam Bankman-Fried confirms participating in New York Times' DealBook
-Barbara Kollmeyer

“ “How did this dude steal billions of dollars and is now speaking at a summit as a free man? Make it make sense.” ”

That was Twitter user @WSBChairman responding to a late Wednesday tweet by disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who confirmed that he will participate in the New York Times’ DealBook Summit in November, where he will be interviewed by journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.

“Scam man. I lost everything because of you,” anotherTwitter user @Alexand56464660 replied to SBF.

In a separate tweet, Sorkin said “nothing is off limits,” when it comes to interviewing SBF. “There are a lot of important questions to be asked and answered,” said the journalist.

The furious responses triggered by tweets from both SBF and Sorkin — who also got suggestions on questions to ask — were just a taste of the boiling rage from the investment world that the former CEO who is accused of mismanaging billions of dollars would appear at the prestigious DealBook gathering of high level executives, business and cultural leaders.

The 29-year old will be appearing alongside Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock BLK, +0.33%, Reed Hastings, Netflix founder and CEO NFLX, -2.23%, Andy Jassy, Amazon.com’s AMZN, -0.59% president and CEO, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, to name a few.

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz is among those echoing that “why is he not in jail?” question, given his firm doesn’t expect to recover some $77 million in cash and digital assets it had in FTX when the whole enterprise fell apart. “I think his day will come,” he said Wednesday in an interview.

SBF has been accused of treating FTX as a ‘personal fiefdom’, in addition to potentially sparking more fallout, with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao saying telling Bloomberg on Thursday that he expects to see “a little bit of contagion.” Crypto trading firm Genesis has also been at the center of bankruptcy worries recently.

But those hoping to come face to face with SBF may be out of luck as a spokesman for the New York Times told MarketWatch that he is expected to be “participating in the interview from the Bahamas.”",0.0,2022-11-25 16:48:24

This is fresh in my memory because I chased a callout on NFLX  recently and the only study I did on it was to see that it was moving. Later observing the loss, I realized there was no reason to have taken this trade. 

You also have to define ""momentum"". You cannot say you won't buy stocks that are ""moving"". Going from memory I think the wiki definition of momentum trading coincides with talk about opening low float gappers.

So basically you have your ""normal"" check boxes for entering a trade and if it happens to be moving rapidy so be it. Just be careful of a reversal as it can be rapid as well.

I think overall right now the problem isn’t with Disney,, I think it’s streaming competition in general. Too many big players, and the market has given them the approval to lose money in hopes to meet scale but it never seems to be enough. I don’t know how anyone solves that problem, obviously NFLX is make some decisions around advertising and maybe that’s the end game.

I can see how they could split it into multiple companies and let them make their own way and escape some of their cultural challenges they seem to face both internally and externally.  My personal take is they got bid up some on high hopes for their streaming service, I know I was excited myself.  I also got supremely disappointed with the service as it has such a small catalogue of programming relative to NFLX or Prime or even Paramount.   Even my Grandkids found more interesting stuff other places and I have since dropped them.  Sure Disney's catalogue of movies is good stuff, but who hasn't seen them half a dozen times or more?

Low VIX also means low volatility, so selling straddles and strangles will be safer for now. They also have more return on capital compared to selling only CCs or CSPs, that's kind of a given. 

However, VIX can turn around at any moment. Get your hedges while they're cheap. We are still in a bear market, so it might be profitable to short any rallies, but it won't be easy money. We could always keep rallying. You can be delta neutral and be short/long volatility or theta. 

If you're planning to sell CSPs with a low VIX, the return is not worth the risk imo. NFLX is near $300 now, are you prepared if it heads back to $250/$200/$150? What are your plans and strategy. Likewise (but unlikely imo) what if NFLX goes toward $350-$400?

I expect to pay taxes on my premiums collected.  STCG.  People get too freaked out over taxation.  Should PAYING TAXES be a deterrent to MAKING MONEY??  

If I go ITM, I roll as I feel comfortable.  I have some DEEP ITM positions (i.e. NFLX and NVDA),  I'll let them go when they get taken.  So, I'll finally get to pay long term taxes on some of my NFLX shares, and I'll finally get to realize my loss on my NVDA shares when that happens.  Meanwhile I roll for more premium and wait.  Yeah, I missed out on some upside gains.  Oh well, time to turn the page and not dwell on it, ya know?  I used to dwell no this kind of thing alot.  No time for that now.

I HAVE BTC on a few occasions for a loss.  When I feel the need.

Frankly, I look at one thing with my accountant to prep for paying my estimated taxes:  I look at my NET GAIN on my TD statement.  It's part of doing this with LESS EMOTION, because in my investing life EMOTIONS are the one thing that hold people back from making smart decisions.....when to buy, when to sell, etc.  I don't want to worry about taxes, wash sales, etc.  I make money.  I pay taxes on it.  I write off losses against my gains to the extent that I can.

NVDA has a descending $160 resistance line with an approximate $118 2 year support line.

Here are the reasons that I like PTON

Shareholder letter from May 10th

“The balance sheet challenge has been managing inventory. We have too much for the current run rate of the business, and that inventory has consumed an enormous amount of cash, more than we expected, which has caused us to rethink our capital structure (more on this in a moment). Fortunately, the obsolescence risk is negligible, and we believe the inventory will sell eventually, so this is primarily a cash flow timing issue, not a structural issue.”

So the loss was “paper loss” as they move inventory it will revert to positive cash flow. 

With Amazon, Dicks now selling bikes I expect the bikes to move - freeing up cash flow and reducing storage fees.

The Hilton partnership will payoff in two ways. 5400 HH will have at least 2 bikes by end of year. That’s about 12000 bikes (moved out of storage). HH members will get 90 day PTON app access for free- I expect lift on sub count.

725,1668706441,0.0,0.0,,"As an experiment this year, I've traded one account using u/ScottishTrader's guidelines for the put side focus, and the other account adopting the same guidance for the put side to the call side for a ""long term"" fully invested neutral approach. You can see my previous posts and comments on how this approach works.

Rolling CSPs ""forever"" provides a good return in this down market since YTD (20%+), even if you are deep ITM on the put side, up to 100 delta. I roll weekly from 21 DTE back out to 30-42 DTE, using Weeklies. I don't take anything off at 50%, as the 21 DTE is to avoid assignment while also providing the proxy for 50% profit. This also smooths out Vega effects, as the few big upticks we've had create big profits. I've been assigned twice when I was caught below 21 DTE on hundreds of trades on about 30 positions.

I want to be fully invested on the call side on the other account where I take assignment and hold stocks, selling CCs. The 20%+ quickly goes negative on assignment, as the stock ""debit"" sucks the life out of the CSP gains. I actively sell CCs using the 30 delta calls regardless of my assigned strikes...using the percentages. But, after almost 11 months, the weekly CC rolls have got me near to BE on most positions (NFLX will take another year for BE!). I roll weeklies up to 100 delta on the CC side and will until the next weekly down draft. I think the downdrafts will continue through to a pause or halt to the Fed rate increases. I've only lost a few positions to actual loss...again because I was not paying attention to 21DTE and ex-DIV days...it seems the rolling strategy to avoid assignment while still collecting a credit works on the CC side as well.",0.0,2022-11-17 17:34:01

&gt;TL;DR: I'm shorting NFLX, CMG, GS and I trimmed my $ASTS position.",0.0,2022-11-14 21:43:54
805,1668461954,0.0,0.0,,"&gt;I tend to go with 400-500$ for a half position and 800-1000$ for a full position, which does seem kind of big for my account size. Correct me if I'm wrong here though!

i think this is quite dependent on various factors, not just your account size - so i don't think can add much to say about it. but personally, i like to keep things simple so i just have a round number in my head that i feel is appropriate for my account size/buying power and i adjust depending on the volatility of a ticker by looking at its ATR (something like NFLX or TSLA can go against you quick if you're not careful - and you might have to sustain a drawdown of $5 or more, not a fun time...)  


&gt;I don't struggle with taking profits too early on swings that immediately go my way but I'm fearful of stocks like CZR getting away.

this is not done by a lot of the traders on RDT from what i've seen (besides occasionally Hari and ProminentRetail) but you can always decide to take partial losses, as you would with partial profits. it can alleviate some of the anxiety that comes from watching the P&amp;L, because let's face it - you're gonna be looking at it one moment or another. the point is to eliminate the emotional attachment you have to the trades and just make decisions objectively",0.0,2022-11-14 21:39:14

I have long follow the entertainment sector so I'm very familiar with how they trade.

PARA hit a 2.5 YEAR low yesterday before closing up on the day on big volume.  Today volume is huge, and PARA is up another 15%.

Buffett has been buying PARA over the past few months (as reported), and the stock is around 70M shares short.

Far more interestingly, however, is PARA trades at a fraction of peers like NFLX.  

In fact, even after losing 60% of its value over the past year (the dollar equivalent of FIFTEEN PARAs), NFLX still has a market cap ten times that of PARA.

PARA has been long ignored, and the Archegos fiasco sure didn't help.  But as ""undervalued"" stocks go, PARA should be at the top of the list.

Go to Wiki and see everything PARA owns.  If you don't already know, you'll be shocked the company still only has a $12B market cap.  Even with a market cap five times higher PARA would seem crazy inexpensive compared to NFLX, DIS and others.

Today, I confirmed my suspicions and would like feedback from others - especially those using IBKR as well.

So when you put together a spread, you get a bid/ask for the debit you'll pay. You put your order through, it fills, now you have a long and short leg. My confusion always came from closing the spread. Naturally, once would think you'd just enter a price higher than the debit paid and you'd get a credit (profit) when it fills. 

So in my case today, I followed Hari into NFLX to try to once and for all get a better understanding on spreads. I got the same setup he did for the same price - 272.50/277.50 for 1.66. I wanted 2.50 so I set my order for that.

Now the part of confusion. Every time I've ever done a spread, I'd always see the bid/ask barely move to represent the unrealized profits I'm seeing. For instance, today, I was up .40 on my spread... or so my position was telling me. Yet when I looked at the bid/ask of the spread, the ask was sitting at 1.90 and the bid 1.74 with the last being 1.84. That's obviously not .40 up from my position. 

When I compared the legs directly, I was in fact up .40. So I was, as always, left confused. Is the spread different from what the single options are doing? Should I close the legs individually to get my .40? .40 up from 1.66 is 2.06, so I figured I'd try something. I set my order to 2.05 and it *instantly* filled. Bid/Ask still 1.74/1.90 with the last being 1.84.

So my question is... is this normal? Should I always set my order to where my profit currently sits regardless of what the bid/ask spread says? Is this only applicable to IBKR for some reason?",0.0,2022-11-10 23:07:54

Amazon \*does\* have some Prime movies in 4K, but they're the exception- not the rule. 

NFLX and DISN, same thing. If they have titles in 4K it's not a reflection of the physical format currently for sale. The only exception I can think of was the Star Trek original cast movies on Para+. They were all in 4K prior to the physical releases. And they promptly vanished when another service licensed them- and those versions on another service were only 1080p. 

DISN is usually the best ensuring their titles are available in 4K, but there are still outliers that are only 1080 despite having physical in 4K.

988,1668046196,0.0,0.0,,"&gt; Well a good way of tracking ""right valuation"" especially for an overvalued stock is to read the earnings see what they're optimizing and what their potential is, where they're cutting, etc. (Ex. why it applies less to AMZN because their expenses are all capex, it's still pretty clear in their earnings that they don't plan to optimize for profit yet) Then look for earnings and value to reach an equilibrium and that'll give you a range.

&gt; That gives me a downside target. For me I have 95-110 as my target range for when the stock goes south. TSLA is a momo stock, so if there is momentum it's a pretty realistic target. Especially when you couple these two ideas together. They're already missing growth targets, if their revenue growth stabilizes and net income and cash flow stabilizes and the market continue to trend down, I think it's pretty realistic.

&gt; Assuming very modest and stabilized growth for 2023, coming down into the low 100s would place them right around 22-30 PE range which in my opinion is fair and reasonable value because it says the company is profitable, but there's still potential to grow. Schiller PE Ratio for SP500 says markets still a bit overvalue at 27. The market normalizing and dropping back to 18-20ish and dragging TSLA back to reasonable valuation is what I see happening. Or really vice versa, TSLA being an S&amp;P500 component and being overvalued and companies like TSLA that are still overvalue is what's driving some of this. So I can see TSLA pulling back more rapidly than the S&amp;P500 while companies like AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, META, NFLX all hold steady and trend with the market as people diversify and reduce risk.

&gt; It's easy to ignore valuation when bonds were not a viable place to store money, and the FEDs continued with an easy money policy. So appetite for risk is a lot higher and drive stocks with potential towards overvaluation. Not so easy to ignore valuation when the economy is trending away from easy money policy and towards QT. So definitely see money getting pulled from the stock market, into treasuries and bonds and even real estate, and a rotation from speculative investing towards valuation investing.

I made this post elsewhere (on WSB) and it's a dumb down explanation to kinda get my point across about valuation in today's market and going forward how you should look at earnings to see if a growth company has enter the stage of profit optimization. AMZN is profitable if it wants to be, I actually think AMZN is closer to 10-15% from fair valuation that makes them attractive in today's market...like say if AMZN decides to start optimizing for profit instead of growth. 

The point is when you were missing an asset class for so long and the FEDs maintained such an easy money policy, it's easy for valuation to get out of control as a disproportionate amount of money is diverted into speculative assets. But when that policy shifts, valuation revert back to EBITDA.",0.0,2022-11-10 02:09:56

But like you said, all the consumer spending is still strong, until it isn't. The start was when TGT, COST, WMT, and all those retailers lowered guidance and missed on earnings. They stocked up on too much inventory that they bought a surplus of to meet demand earlier in the year. High prices will naturally destroy demand and price will stabilize. That's phase one. 

Phase two is when manufactures start slowing down and making less stuff because retailers aren't buying large shipments anymore because there's less people to sell too and they already have too much out of season shit. So they're gonna cut orders. 

We're about at the start of phase 2 when luxury goods start getting cut. When the budget gets tight, people start cutting nonessentials like their NFLX or Disney+ subscriptions. You will see some Becky stocks eventually declining too. SBUX actually looks like it's starting a right shoulder lol. 

Combine that with high energy cost from cold winters and OPEC cutting supply, things are just heating up. Not to mention the decline in Housing prices. Sellers aren't getting bids anywhere, nobody is buying because of high interest rates. 

Don't worry it'll come, but housing and mortages will be one of the last things to go. That's towards the bottom when people can't afford rent and start going homeless. Real depressing shit.

The vaunted Wells downgrade analyst claiming on CNBC that PARA should try being an arms dealer apparently doesn't know the basic facts. PARA has been and is an arms dealer.

PARA management said recently PARA will continue to be an arms dealer. PARA is basically a giant studio. They plan to use discernment when choosing what to keep. Dead To Me and Emily on NFLX, for example, are from PARA. 

That's the media business. Happy Days ran on ABC but was a CBS product. Viacom got the residuals.

In terms of Cramer favorite DIS, they gave challenges. DIS lacks a premium US cable brand like Showtime or HBO. DIS misfired by bringing little content to ESPN+ to protect cable. Paramount+ and even Peacock offer more in sports. Hulu the DIS non-kids brand is very sparse compared to Paramount+ with Showtime, which has blown past Hulu in subscriptions. PARA's Nickelodeon, not Disney, is the #1 cable channel for kids. DIS has a bad reputation with talent as a very cheap outfit. DIS is run by a parks guy, not an entertainment guy. The learning curve has showed. 

Financially DIS has a truly puckering quantity of debt. The market valuation of DIS is sky high, from an enterprise valuation perspective.

That said, DIS has powerhouse brands re content, from Pixar to Disney to Star Wars to Marvel. They'll probably return to #1 at the box office next year.

The actual cost reduction of $3 isn't much compared to the prior lowest 720p without ads at $9.99. I don't think $3 is going to have a huge impact on NFLX subscriber additions by itself. They may plan to use it to offer deals through T-MOBILE etc.",0.0,2022-11-05 00:20:58

NFLX has 72 million US subscribers. NFLX'S subscriber numbers have been stagnant. Until this past week, none were viewers for ads. If 10% downgrade then NFLX'S maximum addressable audience for advertising would be 7.2 million viewers.

Every week, for 21 weeks, CBS'S NCIS show alone - all by itself - delivers 33% more actual, factual US audience to advertisers than the theoretical maximum at NFLX. CBS in viewership is simply very big.

If fewer than 10% of NFLX subscribers downgrade, then the theoretical maximum at NFLX will be even lower. Certainly, NFLX hasn't hit 10% downgraded to ads and lower definition. I downgraded the first day and it doesn't take effect until the end of the billing cycle.

NFLX with ads, which is not a broadcasting network and is not free, competes not with CBS but with PARA'S FAST service Pluto. Pluto has 72 million MAUs, all ad viewers, to NFLX'S potential US 7.2 million, once 10% downgrade - if 10% downgrade.

NFLX also competes with Paramount+. Unlike NFLX the Paramount+ default is ad supported. PARA believes in selling ads, although results have lagged. PARA reorganized their ad department to maximize revenue realization. My guess is that of the 46 million Paramount+ subscribers at least 40 million are ad supported. Again, PARA's ad viewership dwarfs NFLX.

NFLX has a lot of subscribers globally. The US 72 million is only about 1/3 of NFLX subscriptions. Until this week, none of that 72 million were ad viewers. Even if 10% of NFLX US subscribers downgrade, it's a fraction of PARA ad viewers across CBS, Pluto and Paramount+. And PARA viewership is growing, thanks to streaming.

PARA has the viewers, and they're growing. They must maximize revenue from their viewers. They've made necessary moves to insure it gets done.",0.0,2022-11-04 23:45:53

Fear in PARA stock is not based on a cyclical ad downturn, although that certainly happens periodically. Fear in PARA stock is based on a cluster of false premises:

The main fear generator this year is that broadcast TV and cable TV are dead. No, despite every imaginable alternative, 50 million American households watch linear TV every day. In 1985, when the alternatives were reading and radio, the number was 80 million. Americans choose TV entertainment - and with 17 of the 25 top shows Americans choose CBS. Linear TV is durable.

Last year the fear generator was that consumers wouldn't choose PARA streaming services. That's not emphasized anymore since PARA is at 67 million subscribers, mainly in the US, and growing strongly. For comparison, NFLX reportedly has 72 million US subscribers. In total subscriber additions PARA is on track to lap NFLX 10 to 20 times this year. 10 to 20 times. 10. To 20. Times.

Another fear generator is debt. However PARA debt is less than other media companies. PARA is rated as investment grade. PARA has 3.5 billion in cash on hand.

I'm not sure what will happen with your massive NFLX market cap going forward. NFLX replaced Blockbuster and got everybody's content. Now almost everybody wants it back.

Nov. 03, 2022 3:57 PM ETThe Boeing Company (BA)NFLX, AAPL, EBAY, AMZN, MSFT, TWTR, TSLA, CVNA, ROKUBy: Rob Williams SA, SA News Editor108 Comments
 SpaceX Falcon-9 Rocket And Crew Dragon Capsule Launches From Cape Canaveral Sending Astronauts To The International Space Station
Saul Martinez

Boeing (NYSE:BA) is working to rebuild its business after losses piled up as the aircraft maker grappled with two fatal 737 MAX crashes and other difficulties. Its investors would be best rewarded if SpaceX, the spacecraft maker founded by Elon Musk, bought Boeing (BA) and broke it up.

That’s the claim by Duncan Davidson, partner at Bullpen Capital, speaking in an interview Thursday on business news channel CNBC.

“Elon likes to fix things. Boeing (BA) needs to be fixed,” Davidson said. “It may be the space segment of Boeing (BA), which is what Elon would want, would be relatively cheap. Because I think Boeing (BA) is selling at a huge discount to a breakup value.”

In such a scenario, SpaceX would acquire Boeing (BA) and spin off its defense and commercial jet units, while holding onto the spacecraft business. The moves would position SpaceX to win more longer-term contracts from the U.S. government, such as for rockets that ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

“The reason why Elon is the right guy, by the way, is that Boeing (BA) has to get back to an engineering culture,” Davidson said, pointing to the 797 as a plane that never got off the drawing board. “The engineering culture would have launched it. The finance culture doesn't launch anything.”

Musk, who also is CEO of electric car pioneer Tesla (TSLA), last month completed a $44 billion deal to take social-media platform Twitter (TWTR) private. He's now implementing his plan to make Twitter less dependent on advertising revenue for growth.

Davidson also said technology giant Microsoft (MSFT) should buy streaming-device maker Roku (ROKU) to catch up with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) in the streaming video market. The move would position Microsoft (MSFT) to eventually acquire Netflix (NFLX), assuming antitrust authorities wouldn’t block the deal.

Online marketplace EBay (EBAY) also should buy Carvana (CVNA), the online used-car dealer whose stock is down 95% this year, to expand its offerings, Davidson said.

Supply is always constrained. Even nflx is constrained by server bandwidth. So the behavior I'm talking about happens all the time. Pre COVID, post COVID, post china lockdown. Always.

But a shortage of supply would cause a 1 time price hike. Inflation would jump up, and then go back to 0. Why hasn't it? Well wages have gone up considerably so demand is now rising. Supply has stopped falling but rising demand is now driving inflation. If demand were constant inflation would zero out. Prices would have adjusted up and stayed there.

Big Tech companies really make sense to me because they can help PARA improve their ad targeting and simultaneously get even more data from their customers, creating synergies aside from just economies of scale for administrative duties. They could also easily help Paramount improve their app as it needs improvement, put in AI capabilities for suggestions that NFLX seems to believe it's their competitive advantage, and help bring more economies of scale in server costs as MSFT and FB are both cloud giants though FB doesn't sell it's cloud services.

PARA is on pace this year to lap Netflix in subscription additions - in absolute terms not percentage terms - 10-20 times. 10 to 20 times. 10. To. 20. Times. 

So the analyst, following the Wells guy, suggests PARA should fold streaming and just sell to NFLX 🤣. They're idiots who are making me richer. It just looks like I'm poorer right now. 

That's as close as Bakish came to pounding the table and screaming that PARA is knocking the schit out of the competition, certainly including poor NFLX, which isn't a studio and churns out endless piles of barely watchable but expensive crap.

1177,1667491323,0.0,0.0,,"I agree that costs need to be cut. Revenue up and profits down? Linear TV involved in a slow erosion of viewership? A recessionary headwind for ad sales? Slashing costs is the answer to everything. It's important that nothing is cut that appears on a screen that can stream.

That said, Bakish and Chopra are doing a good job. With the pandemic ending people are stepping out, but Market is straight-line extrapolating network TV rapidly falling towards zero. It's just not so. The difference in viewership between 2018 and now is not nearly as much as the Bear narrative suggests, while CBS dominates ratings. #1 network, #1 box office, #1 cable for kids, #1 FAST, fastest growing US streamer - that's what we want.

Into headwinds, revenues are growing while subscriptions ramp up. Considering the size of the addressable market, the demonstrated appeal of PARA content to consumers, and the increasing awareness of Paramount+ with Showtime as a compelling option, I don't think PARA streaming is capped at 67 million. There's no reason to think it's capped at all.

At the same time, I think the selling this week goes beyond shorts. In addition to fallacious claims that network TV and cable TV have had a heart attack, Market suddenly is afraid that nobody will buy ads in 2023. Market fears a bad economy and that only NFLX will be able to sell ads. Early this year PARA had a strong pre-sale, which is coming around again. Market fears that nobody will bite. PARA, however, has faced economic cycles and serious competition for many years. PARA has done well despite the competition from network rivals and heavyweights like Googl and Meta.

I'm far underwater and getting deeper every day as PARA'S stock price relative to value drops from the absurd to the frankly unbelievable. Have I lost money though? No. Instead I have been able to buy an interest in this company at prices that I never imagined. I'll buy more, as I go along, as long as it stays so extremely undervalued.",0.0,2022-11-03 16:02:03

1199,1667446730,0.0,0.0,,"Reddit has long been known as one of the most influential social media companies in the world. Founded in 2005 by college roommates Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, today the company boasts the sixth most trafficked site on the web and draws 50 million users on a daily basis.

The social media giant has been referred to as the largest discussion forum on Earth and involves registered users (known as ""Redditors"") submitting content to the site in the form of links, text posts, images, and videos. This content is then voted up or down by other members, with all posts being organized by subject into user-created boards called ""subreddits.""

While the site draws less attention than its more ""prestigious"" competitors such as Twitter and Facebook, recent events have demonstrated the power of Redditors to influence the outside world. In 2016, for example, the famous subreddit r/The_Donald created thousands of discussions and Internet memes surrounding Donald Trump, serving as a powerful force in support of the future president.

In 2021, Redditors shook up the financial world when the stock trading subreddit r/wallstreetbets led hundreds of thousands of members to invest in GameStop (GME) stock, sending the share price soaring and causing hedge fund Melvin Capital to permanently close.

Despite its high traffic and cultural appeal, Reddit recently unrolled its first major NFT launch in early September to expand its crypto footprint. While user adoption was initially slow, the last two weeks have seen Reddit NFTs become one of the top collections on OpenSea.

Initial Rollout

Reddit first announced the plans for its new NFT collection back in July, and although the company had released one previous collection in the summer of 2021, no one really knew what to expect.

The social network eventually released 90 NFT designs based on Snoo, the Reddit alien mascot, with various visual styles contributed by an array of artists.

There are a few major differences between Reddit's July 2021 NFT collection, called Cryptosnoos, and its recent NFT release.

While Cryptosnoos launched on Ethereum, the new avatars launched on the Polygon blockchain.

Cryptosnoos are unique 1/1 pieces, but avatars come in different editions ranging from as low as 100 unique pieces to as many as 1,000+.

Redditors can get a free NFT for creating a polygon ""vault"" (wallet) for which Reddit, the company, will pay minting costs.

Currently, there are 169 separate collections that span two seasons. This amounts to a total of over 86,000 separate NFTs.

Some of the most valuable collections include The Senses, Foustlings, and a Spooky Season collection by poieeeyeee.

This fan-made site offers a way to view every collection and toggle between seasons one and two.

Web 3 Strategy

What made Reddit's recent approach to their avatar NFTs truly unique was that the company avoided all usage of crypto terminology, did not mention the word ""NFT"" or crypto ""wallet"" in any of their announcements, and allowed users to purchase the pieces using fiat currency.

Instead, the company marketed their NFTs as ""blockchain-backed Collectible Avatars"" and dubbed the digital wallet users would need to store the pieces a ""Reddit vault.""

Reddit's strategy has paid off. Commentators hailed the company's ""boring"" jargon as a creative way to disarm Redditors who would be antagonistic to blockchain-based technology.

Additionally, Reddit's stated goal of the initiative, ""to empower artists"" on the site and give them the ability to receive royalty payments for all secondary sales, distanced the company from the blatant cash grabs that characterized many NFT projects in 2021.

Massive Adoption

Since the Reddit NFT marketplace was launched in July, the number of users of Reddit Vault wallets has skyrocketed. Current estimates put the number of created vaults at over 3 million, with approximately 2.5 million of those created to specifically purchase Reddit NFTs.

Reddit also accelerated adoption by airdropping free avatars to some of the site’s most devoted users, introducing many people to NFTs for the first time.

According to Dune analytics, cumulative sales volume has topped $10 million for the life of the project, with volume reaching a peak on Oct. 24 and declining steadily since that point.

The top sale so far has been a Spooky Season avatar dubbed ""Midas Touch 1"" that sold for 18 ETH, or about $24,150.

Future Value

It doesn't take a genius to see the potential of Reddit's new avatars to onboard millions of new users to Web3 and expand the reach of NFTs.

The company has over 430 million active users, and while BAYC and Cryptopunks make the headlines, they are restricted with the number of participants they can have and will probably have to leverage Reddit's network and tap into their vast user base at some point.

Other major brands such as Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), fashion houses like Burberry, Gucci, Balenciaga, or even celebrities with their ventures will also seek to partner with Reddit not only to get their NFT projects or products in front of larger audiences but also to test Web3 initiatives before they develop a standalone product.

For example, a major company could partner with Reddit and test the market rather than spend time, effort, and resources to develop its web3 strategy. This means those who hold Reddit avatars will probably be the recipients of NFT drops and products from other brands in the future.

Already, there is talk of a free ""Football World Cup” themed drop for the World Cup.

Unlike a lot of existing NFT projects, Reddit has vast capital and manpower to create virtually anything they want. Although the company lacks an integrated NFT marketplace, Reddit's ambition to expand its Web3 footprint could soon make that a reality.",0.0,2022-11-03 03:38:50

Including R&amp;D : profits were down -52% y/o/y 

They artificially maintained revenues by increasing number of ads by 17% while users were up +2%. Meaning users are now being bombarded by ads.

I would also add that advertising pie may shrink with a recession and that NFLX and DIS will now want their share of that smaller pie.

The other half is because of the fears around the ROI with VR/AR, which completely removing it from the equation you still have solid underline fundamentals. I'm not arguing it's worth 100% of it's all time high, I'm arguing it's worth more than it's current 5 year low. 

Also using past market performance as an indicator of future performance, is the most common mistake any amateur investor makes. Your also basically claiming the efficient market hypothesis is true and all asset pricing is efficient and reasonable. Unfortunately this is just confirmation bias.

I also have YouTubeTV with 4K that costs an additional 12 a month on top of the base rate.  I view PARA more than NFLX, but pay less for it.  It is a great value.

I think Tulsa King looks better than Mayor of Kingstown.  1923 looks better than 1883.  
What do you see PARA’s DTC revenue being in 2024?  What do you see their spend being?  Could be a 1.5B profitability improvement.  
Linear should be better than this year.  Presidential election year that will likely break spend records.

🌽 came out right after the financial crisis, in an era of easy money and QE, and has existed solely as a leveraged play on money printing. That is now ending for the first time in its existence. 

It is not a stable store of value like gold, because it trades like a high beta tech stock. That’s just the reality. Look at the price action - it just trades with the Nasdaq mostly. 

Not manipulated? I don’t think so. Whales and exchanges manipulate it all the time and large players hold the most coins and dictate the price swings. Just like very other asset. 

You say the use cases are still being developed. I say that there has never been an internet technology so well funded in the 21st century with so little to show for it. What are you gonna do with 🌽? Honestly man. Other forms of payment are infinitely more convenient. People just hold and trade it. It is pure speculation. I have never seen a convincing use case. People are just trying to invent problems that don’t exist with solutions that are complicated because they have a financial incentive to do so. 

I attest, however, that I could be wrong. I would not even say 🌽 has crashed this year. META and NFLX are just as bad. But my thesis is that there will come a day where people realize that the value they once thought was there is just not, and it will slowly but surely go to zero.

A company can have negative cash flow but take off like a rocket. Tesla, NFLX, AAPL had at one point negative cash flow for years but yet their stock took off like a rocket. Once people perceive the company in a very positive light it doesn’t even matter if the company misses earnings expectations. The stock will still take off. $PARA fell to absurd valuation levels because the stock got manipulated by Billy, Goldman Sachs, and Shari Redstone herself. So people have stayed away from it. Unfortunately most investors are amateurs, don’t know how to read a financial statement, don’t even know what a PE ratio is or what FCF really means. If you do a FCF analysis the valuation of $PARA comes out to $50. But since more than 80% of all investors are amateurs, an analyst can come out with some absurd numbers and paint a pessimistic picture about $PARA and most people will believe it. So if you take a gander at all these analyst saying $PARA is worth $15, $16, $19, I really do not know how they are getting there.

People slammed zuckerberg so hard for instagram and whatsapp purchases which turned out to be quite successful. 

They slam META for privacy intrusions all the while likely still using facebook (FB still has  a concurrent near 2 billion daily active users, which is like 28% of the planets population...).

They say META is a shit company for going after the metaverse, meanwhile they are pulling in 28-30 billion average revenue per quarter, with a healthy profit margin above 25%.

META is the definition of an oversold stock that will very likely rebound quite handedly in the next couple of years. 

I want to point out that people were saying the same shit about NFLX - that they were a dead company, that their userbase would falter and that growth would slow or even become negative, when the stock was in the low 200s or high 100s...and now look at it. Pushing over 300 again.

The real investment right now is honestly META. I see three outcomes:

1. Zuckerberg realizes Metaverse is a waste of time, pulls funding and pursues something else - stock rallies hard
2. Zuckerberg actually nails the Metaverse and it becomes akin to the iPhone or some other big product and the stock rallies hard
3. Zuckerberg fails the Metaverse and doesn't pull out and it runs META into the ground to bankruptcy

3 is possible but lets be honest 1 or 2 is most likely which makes META an attractive investment if you have the patience to wait for a rebound and likely suffer some blood in the short term",0.0,2022-10-28 15:31:43

You are right, mathematically a CSP changes less than 100 shares + Short call per % change of the underlying (AMZN). But now OP has realized loss of 2k (money he’s never gonna see again unless he converts to shares and starts selling calls/Amzn goes back to whatever his strike was, or he rolls himself out of the position over time), he’s got work to do.

whereas I still own 100 shares and have the cash from short calls. My shares are worth less today than yesterday, I realize that, but I have conviction they will rise in price in the long term so a short term unrealized loss doesn’t bother me, par for the course.

The only problem is that value investors tend to whine when a company isn't 100% focused on profitability and now META is disappointing these investors too with their continued commitment to the Metaverse.

There's really no identifiable investor base for META at this point. If you're looking for growth it's not that attractive at this point. And if you're looking for value you don't want to own a company that's pursuing growth over profitability. The investors who might like it are those that share Zuck's vision on the future of AR/VR.

The way I'd look at META is that while they're not likely to grow like they did in the past, this is still the second largest digital ads player in the world and a company with more reach than any other company to the global consumer. If their DAUs and MAUs were dropping then I'd understand why investors were fleeing, but the core business is still really strong. This valuation decline is not reflective of comparable decline in the core business but instead entirely driven by the sentiment of investors.

I think there is huge upside risk to anyone bearish on this stock right now. Perhaps as much as 100% upside over the next 6 months. What we're seeing with META today is very similar to the situation with NFLX earlier this year. Growth investors fled at signs of slowing growth and then value investors jumped in and started crying about how much they were spending on content and that they didn't to compromise their product by introducing ads. The only difference here is that NFLX caved to the value investors while META didn't.

If META simply said they're done with the metaverse (which I don't think they should do) and that they're going to be returning as much profits to shareholders as possible I can almost guarantee that the stock would rally 100%.",0.0,2022-10-28 09:28:30

Market conditions are horrible. Combine this with the sentiment on META and you get an atrocious cocktail.

It's still a very profitable company. They are spending a crazy amount of money in a new project and this deters all investors, which is logic.

My personal thinking is that they're starting to ramp up on the commercialization of VR and it will start generating money for Reality Labs. I'm looking at 2024, post-recession. They'll be pacing their spending and we'll see how much growth VR has. We'll understand if there's truly potential or not.
