36,1669729455,z7uh2r,1," Twitter owner Elon Musk claimed on Monday in a series of tweets that Apple had threatened to remove the Twitter app from the App Store as part of its app review moderation process.

‚ÄúApple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won‚Äôt tell us why,‚Äù Musk tweeted.

In other tweets fired off on Monday morning, he called Apple‚Äôs App Store fees a ‚Äúsecret 30% tax,‚Äù and ran a poll asking if ‚ÄúApple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers.‚Äù He also claimed that Apple has pulled most of its advertising from Twitter.

Apple‚Äôs App Store is the only way to distribute software to iPhones. If the Twitter app were pulled, the social network would lose one of its main distribution platforms, although the service is available for the web.

In addition, Apple requires iPhone app makers to pay between 15% and 30% of any digital goods sold through their apps. Musk has said one of his plans for Twitter is to raise billions of dollars from subscriptions, such as Twitter Blue, which is offered through the iPhone app. If it were to grow to Musk‚Äôs goals, Apple would collect hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.

Apple has faced challenges to its App Store fees and policies from companies such as Spotify and Epic Games, but Musk is no stranger to attracting worldwide attention, and may represent Apple‚Äôs biggest challenge to its control over iPhone app distribution so far.

Apple declined to comment about Musk‚Äôs tweets.

But there are signs that Apple is watching the social network closely to see if it violates any App Store policies.

Representatives for unnamed app stores, which include Apple‚Äôs App Store as well as Google Play for Android devices, reached out to Twitter earlier this month after Musk took over and the site saw a wave of hate speech, according to a New York Times op-ed by Yoel Roth, Twitter‚Äôs former head of trust and safety.

Phil Schiller, Apple‚Äôs former chief marketer who oversees App Review, apparently deleted his Twitter account earlier this month after Musk took over.

68,1669640755,z6w3gv,1,"Apple may fall short of its production target for its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models by nearly 6 million units worldwide, Bloomberg reported Monday, after workers at the world's largest iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, China, protested delayed bonus payments, poor living conditions caused by China‚Äôs stringent Covid restrictions.

According to Bloomberg, the exact size of the shortfall still remains unclear and will likely depend on manufacturer Foxconn‚Äôs ability to hire enough workers for the iPhone assembly line to keep up with production targets.

Earlier this month, Apple had cut its production target for the iPhone 14 by 3 million units due to Covid-related disruptions at the Foxconn plant and that number has now been revised by double, the report adds.

Workers at the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou‚Äîsometimes referred to as ‚ÄúiPhone city‚Äù‚Äîhave been forced to live on-site in a closed bubble, only being allowed to move from the factory floor to their dorm rooms due to the city‚Äôs Covid control measures.

While sales of the cheaper iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have slowed down, the pricier iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have continued to remain in strong demand in the U.S., the report adds.

While the company has diversified its manufacturing line by making some of its devices in India and Vietnam, nearly all of its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models are made in the Zhengzhou factory.

Apple‚Äôs shares were down 1.87% in pre-market trading on Monday morning following the report.

Apple (AAPL) is currently down 1.9% in the premarket after the company reportedly may fall short of its production target for its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models by nearly 6 million units worldwide amid its China factory protests related to its Covid-19 restrictions.

 Elon Musk has announced big, albeit confusing, plans for Twitter since he took over the social network last month.

Musk wants to vastly increase the revenue the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more ‚Äúfree speech,‚Äù which in some cases seems to mean restoring previously banned accounts like the one owned by former president Donald Trump.

But Musk‚Äôs plans for Twitter could put it in conflict with two of the biggest tech companies: Apple and Google.

## Tensions are brewing

One of the biggest risks to Musk‚Äôs vision for ‚ÄúTwitter 2.0‚Äù is the possibility that his changes violate Apple or Google‚Äôs app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.

Tensions are already brewing. Musk complained in a tweet just last week about app store fees that Google and Apple charge companies like Twitter.

‚ÄúApp store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly,‚Äù Musk tweeted. ‚ÄúIt is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.‚Äù In a follow-up post, he tagged the Department of Justice‚Äôs antitrust division, which is reportedly investigating app store rules.

His complaint is over the 15% to 30% cut Apple and Google take from purchases made inside apps, which could eat into the desperately-needed revenue from Musk‚Äôs plans for $8 per month from Twitter Blue subscriptions.

Over the weekend, Phil Schiller, the former head Apple marketing executive who still oversees the App Store, apparently deleted his widely-followed Twitter account with hundreds of thousands of followers.

On Nov 15, the three major U.S. stock indexes closed in positive territory Tuesday, with the Dow up 0.17%, the NASDAQ up 1.45%, and the S&amp;P 500 up 0.87%. All three indexes pared gains in midday trading, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow briefly turning negative after a sudden missile attack in Poland and a surge in risk aversion.

The US producer price index (PPI) rose less than expected in October, both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis, clearly showing the broader trend of slowing inflation growth in the US and increasing the likelihood that the Fed will slow the pace of interest rate hikes.

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

&amp;#x200B;

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn‚Äôt require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.73**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.57**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.25%**|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66** |
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Growth Rate Estimate with market risk|12.68%|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-3.60%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|\-20.92%|
|Intel‚Äôs Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,127,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

note: EPS is the EPS of last month, this is to compare the company in that time period to today's macro data.

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS √ó \[(8.5 + (2 √ó Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS √ó (8.5 + 2\*g) √ó 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS √ó (7 + 1\*g) √ó 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|12.68|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures.

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor‚Äôs sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC ‚Äì Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX ‚Äì Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI ‚Äì Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG ‚Äì Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS ‚Äì Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&amp;C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&amp;E

# Revenue Forecast

With the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 12.86%

## Analysts Price Target

**$72 High**

**$32.74 Average**

**$18 Low**

**$32.71 OP‚Äôs**

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product‚Äôs portfolio, where AMD doesn‚Äôt have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival‚Äôs marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel‚Äôs perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend‚Äôs yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

The cooldown of infration migh suggest a better economic landscape for 2023

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $32.71.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

Cook reportedly added that Apple will likely buy more European-made chips as well.

That‚Äôs all in an effort to reduce its reliance on chip manufacturing from Asia, which has been plagued by COVID-19 and shipping disruptions in recent years. Apple has been working to remake its supply chain, with dozens of its parts suppliers [adding manufacturing facilities in the U.S.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-suppliers-add-manufacturing-sites-in-u-s-with-focus-on-california-11664912415?mod=article_inline) in fiscal 2021, according to a supplier list released by Apple in October.

The Arizona plant Cook referred to is likely [the $12 billion facility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-12-billion-chip-factory-in-arizona-2020-05-15?mod=article_inline) north of Phoenix being built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which was announced in 2020. TSMC is the world‚Äôs largest contract manufacturer of silicon chips and is Apple‚Äôs chip-making partner.

Last week, [the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-making-juggernaut-tsmc-eyes-multibillion-dollar-arizona-factory-expansion-11667973859?mod=article_inline) TSMC would expand that facility, which could serve as a second manufacturing plant.

Today we saw yet again another massive sell off. I am trying to decide if markets are truly that over extended that anything will cause a dump or if we are just getting truly rogue new waves causing a dump. The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now‚Ä¶ it sure shows signs it doesn‚Äôt want to stay there. 

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland ‚Äúincident‚Äù is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. 

Now SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is‚Ä¶ did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.

Support- 398.5 (key pivot point) -&gt; 395 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 390.1

Looking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. 

Futures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965. 

Support- 3965 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3900

Tesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation. 

Support- 190.8 -&gt; 185.7 -&gt; 177.4

We did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn‚Äôt take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren‚Äôt that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC. 

There still is a very real scenario where JPOW says 50 bps hike and hints at another 50bps next meeting in January. On top of that there is nothing saying after 5 consecutive decreases on the CPI YoY readings that we don‚Äôt get a rogue spike in CPI YoY that sends the markets tumbling. At this point with the markets now expecting a beat on CPI any miss is going to get bloody‚Ä¶ like historically bloody type of days‚Ä¶

Good day today. I was busy with my daughter and her birthday most of the morning so I wasn‚Äôt around to trade until about 1230‚Ä¶ hit that morning put scalp on SPX before I left. I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don‚Äôt enjoy trading much and I also don‚Äôt trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play.

I am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don‚Äôt know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn‚Äôt even a missile‚Ä¶ we probably will never know the truth. 

I did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. 

That‚Äôs the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of ‚Äúare you going to take profits at open?‚Äù ‚Äúyou going to take your loss at open?‚Äù and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn‚Äôt about to play out.

SPY went on a super impressive breakout back to 400 only to get absolutely smacked down. This was actually a super bearish close today and shows a local top in my opinion. It will take some big strength to push through 400 that is for sure. 

With this black bull channel we actually have a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow. Not sure exactly how low we will go but until we can break through and close over 400 there is not a reason to expect further upside.

Apple ran right into its daily 100ema today, however, found itself running into a brick wall and has now retraced pretty significantly.

Tesla attempted once again to break out over its daily ema and break out of this falling wedge on the daily however was once again unsuccessful. I had said last week that the 196.1 double top was in play and it sure was today. With this doji I do expect some downside tomorrow. IT did however find itself holding key support of 190.9 EOD. I will look for that support to break tomorrow and test the blue support line at 188. If we lose that support I am looking for 177.4 support retest this week. However, if we can hold support and finally take out the daily 8ema and 196.1 then we can look for the gap fill and possibly a bigger push towards 208.8 resistance. 

Support- 185.9 -&gt; 177.4

Resistance- 196.1 -&gt; 201.9 -&gt; 204.9

Lots of movement on the VIX today. Had a nice 6% green open that led to a hard sell off under that key 23.5 range. However, still not exactly sure what caused it but EOD we had a pretty big spike of the VIX that put it back over 23.5 and caused it to close its biggest green day since October 6th.

I obviously I had that crazy 600%/$30k win last week but that was playing a CPI play‚Ä¶ strictly day trading today was the best day I have put in in a very long time both with profits, win rate, and consistency. Felt great for sure and I know a lot of other did just a great today!

Lets start with the FG index which I did talk about earlier this week on Monday we were only at 61 and we have now jumped up to 66. As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. 

I wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. 

January the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  
 April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   
 August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.

That means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at 401.6 and find out rejection point there. This actually is exactly where we rejected in august on the dead cat bounce. 

This COULD give us a trajectory of about 339.4 sometime between December 1st and December 20th. However, my one caveat here is the million dollar question ‚Äúwhat would the catalyst for such a drop be?‚Äù Earnings is over, no cpi/ fomc until December 13th/ 14th and more or less there isn‚Äôt much I can for see that could panic people enough to sell that intensely. 

So if we break the trend and we let the FG index run hotter than usual the next question is ‚Äúwhere are we going? How high are we going to go?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0byl8v7iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6526517148b713a6e8f9d5b1479a461453f70ef4

Looking at the daily chart I see a bull and a bear case. Bull case would be that we push minimally to the 200ema at 401.6. If we can CLOSE a daily candle over that 200ema then I have no doubt next week we could test 405.4 channel resistance and we very well could end up testing that bigger solid green resistance line for the overall 2022 bear channel. This resistance on Friday is 410.8. 

However, if we either reject the 200ema or from here here double top and see downside the first stop is going to be 390. This is the level that bulls need to defend. If they lose 390 then we are looking at a pretty convincing minimally partial gap fill to 381.14. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rkrafse8iez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf2c3a225eaf8f4605823c4dae5e1717f1881da

Now if we flip over to the weekly view things become a little more clear. We dead stopped into the weekly 100ema today and couldn‚Äôt break through that. We have a nice blue bull channel formed here and a pretty mild black rising wedge also. 

Next weeks key resistance comes in at 399.5. This will be our pivot point. Break out over it and hold that as support through the week and we are looking at a test of the WEEKLY bear channel resistance at 412.7 next week. However, if we reject and form a double top here at the weekly 100ema we could be looking for that backtest of 390. Same with the daily if we lose 390 then we will look for a bigger retrace. 

I am pretty indifferent here in the fact that I don‚Äôt see a catalyst to make people want to sell at these levels. Most investors are probs thinking ‚Äúbottoms in‚Äù and they don‚Äôt wanna miss the next bull run. It will take a lot to convince them to sell. However, Spy just put its greenest week in since the week of June 21st. There definitely could be at minimum some profit taking and with the VIX unwinding we could see some people start hedging for next CPI/ FOMC. 

For me I wouldn‚Äôt take a long here but I feel until we touch the 200ema its too early to start a put position.  

Key support- 390 -&gt; 375.8

Key resistance- 399.5 -&gt; 409

Similar case here on the Futures daily we haven‚Äôt quite touched that key 200ema yet which is the gateway for the next big run up or the potential for the next top. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we look at futures weekly chart you can see this is actually a true weekly bullish engulfing candle. This should provide some upside for next week from a technical standpoint. However, we need to take out that weekly 100ema first. We are also well above that 3870 JPM collar call too. 

Support- 3915 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705

Resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4085 -&gt; 4152 (bear market resistance‚Ä¶ 3.8% from close)

Apple put that 135 support in this week and from here this thing has never looked back. I believe it will test that bear channel resistance next week. Apple fell just short of its 100ema and 200ema this week which as I have mentioned before on Apple is always a period of consolidation. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3v0exaraiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31939546e40711ce5d2787140850194ebbc40942

The weekly on Apple actually is still trading within an overall bear channel. That resistance comes in at 151.9 next week. If we see Apple break through that level then it has broken its bear channel and we can look for further upside. Apple did close back over its 8ema but fell just short of its 20/50ema. 

Key support- 147.2 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 150.5 -&gt; 151.9 -&gt; 155.8

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla mostly due to its sporadic movement the last few weeks has quite a few things set up on it. It has the bigger red falling wedge formed on it that has a tighter falling wedge with that black resistance line within it. There is also a potential recovery support line highlighted in blue. 

Tesla did come up today and get near the daily 8ema but failed to close over it today it also came within 14 cents from the November 7th 196.66 gap fill. I am keeping an eye out for a double top Monday at the daily 8ema which also would coincide with the back resistance line at 196.8. As long as we hold under that resistance line there should be downside expected. However, once we break through that resistance then I would expect a test of possibly the daily 20ema (especially if the markets remain bullish). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4bh9pavbiez91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fca84522336e34f5b4b1127819a44f38bf570a2

I actually remain bearish on tesla, however, looking at the weekly it broke under the weekly 200ema as I had said for the first time in 3 years, however, it popped and closed over it. With this huge hanging man candle here there actually is a pretty solid case for upside next week. The weekly bear channel resistance will be 211.1 and will also be the weekly 8ema. 

Key support- 195.8 -&gt; 177.8 -&gt; 167.9

Key resistance- 207.3 -&gt; 228.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hyg1mbzciez91.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f07afd85e27a9d363318b1eff870b95193e5597e

The VIX has now closed below 23.5 support for the first time since the days before the September CPI reading. This also is the lowest reading the VIX has closed at since August 26th which was Jackson Hole. 

This kinda goes even further to prove my point that I don‚Äôt see a bearish catalyst for this market. IF we look at the last two times the VIX was at these levels there was bearish catalysts that pushed it back up. Jackson hole and then CPI. But with no big fed events, no cpi and no FOMC for another month what is going to be the catalyst? What is going to be the reason the VIX wants to spike? 

There might not be one for the next month. If there is no catalyst we might be looking at the VIX going back to that support line from the August low at 19.7. For me this is where we open a longer 30-60dte put position. We are in no mans land right now. Going short is fighting the trend but going long on calls feels like we are buying the absolutely top. 

Remember guys‚Ä¶ CASH is a position! We don‚Äôt always have to be long. We can be cash over night. We can play some short 7-14 dte plays and wait for the next top/ bottom to more clearly present itself.

I will do weekly updates on this but also include it in my daily log. The general idea here is I will be using $5,000 for ONE trade per day.. the goal is 10% profits BUT a hard set -20% stop loss. We will see where this takes us and if we can make one trade a day for about 10% profitable or not. On the right side you can see I broke it down in an equivalent had you used a smaller account instead of my $5,000.

Overall this was a pretty great week. My most profitable week ever I believe and I also secured my biggest win ever this week with that CPI play. However, I recognize while that was a high probability play‚Ä¶ if I was wrong and we opened flat I woulda closed my week out red. 

I also made some mistakes this week. I let a few of my level to level puts run way too long and pass my 25% stop loss. Still a struggle but letting the SPY put from yesterday run to today for -82.32% and taking a bigger -60%+ loss on Tesla earlier in the week really hit me hard. 

This week I absolutely KILLED it on scalps hitting 95% win rate and a nice $4,889. I had mentioned last week and earlier this week whether or not tesla plays were worth it or not. In review you can see that my win rate was much lower on them, however, profitability wise I actually was very successful. Something some fail to remember is that win rate doesn‚Äôt always equal profits. For this week low win rate still netted profits. 

I am always learning and always critiquing my strategy. I will continue to monitor my L2Ls and see how next week shapes up.

A beat on CPI actually makes trading SPY for the next month even harder then a miss. Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI ‚Äúcame down‚Äù we have to deal with yet again the ‚Äúfed pivot/ slowing‚Äù news media cycles hitting the tapes. 

Overall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode.

SPY just made yet again market history‚Ä¶ today was the 3rd largest daily point gain in market history, the 2nd largest intraday points swing, and the largest daily percent change this year (bear or bull). This was the largest green close since march 23rd 2009 which closed up 7.08%. 

What an incredible and unbelievable day. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fxzosz19m7z91.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8de2862429b1ff4b94c9a343156e473c42850fff

We impressively broke through the daily rising wedge support last night at market close (now that makes a new support) and today we just touched and held the resistance of that same rising wedge. That is one hell of a swing and I cant even believe it myself. We also went from close in the bear channel to now closing in the purple channel completely skipping the green channel close. 

If the market is being rational it is going to come down and at least test 390 purple channel support. There could be a case for it to come all the way down to 384 or even 381.1 to gap fill. However, with the extreme volume on VOLD today and just the overall momentum I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised (despite it being illogical) to see tomorrow be yet another big green day. 

Support- 393 -&gt; 390 -&gt; 388 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 381.1

Resistance- 397.9 -&gt; 402 (daily 200ema) 

Something I would like to point out is that this day is very similar to May 4th on SPY. That was a FOMC day that went on a similar insane rip EOD and end up with a flat top daily candle much like SPYS today. That day resulted in a massive drop the next day. Something interesting about this also is that the VIX put its biggest drop of the year in since May 4th today also. Tomorrow will be interesting to say the least.

Weekly chart wise you can see we are still in this bull channel withing the green 2022 bear channel. Resistance of this channel is 397.6 (this is a potential place we could pop to tomorrow before retracing). We also have a rising wedge inside this bull channel to keep an eye on too. Next week 2022 bear channel resistance comes in at 412.7. We break that and effectively bear market is ‚Äúover.‚Äù Technical wise.

Futures weekly setting up very similarly looking at the bull channel within the 2022 green bear channel with a rising wedge within that bull channel. 

4000 is the weekly 100ema and also the bull channel resistance for this week. 

4150 will be the weekly 2022 bear channel resistance for next week.

Apple with an impressive day closing up 8.9%. which is incredible. I don‚Äôt have the same data easily available on apple as I do spy but im sure since covid 2020 this is its and most of techs biggest closure. 

Apple broke through that red bear channel and actually closed over the daily 8, and 20ema falling just short of the daily 50ema. With the blue/ black falling wedge still in play that resistance will be 146.6 tomorrow and from there we can test the overall black bear channel dating back to august which has resistance of 153.4 tomorrow. 

Support- 144.9 -&gt; 141.2 -&gt; 138.5

Tesla is the wild child that no one wants to touch cause its so unpredictable. The biggest thing that happened today is that it failed to make a new daily low for the first time since October 31st. Many (me included) have been waiting for the bounce on telsa that just never came. We just might be looking at that bounce right now. With 190.9 clearly being resistance on Tesla we very well may be looking at our double top rejection. This daily hammer candle very well could result in a double top and further sell off tomorrow. 

Biggest thing to watch for tomorrow is whether Tesla closes below 188.3 or not which is the weekly 200ema. 

Support- 186.7 -&gt; 177.4

Resistance- 194.3 -&gt; 197 -&gt; 201.8

Pretty impressive candle on the daily chart here for the VIX. The biggest drop as I said since May 4th. While the VIX was in much different levels back then something that is VERY intriguing to me is that today we dropped to about 22.84 and recoiled and the VIX closed right at that key 23.5 support level. I am a little surprised to see that on a 5.5% green day for SPY. Actually I am surprised that the VIX didn‚Äôt drop more like 15% especially when you consider that on big red days for CPI or other events we can see a 12-20% green day on the VIX. 

This 23.5 level is a big level. The VIX could be hinting to us that the markets are not as bullish as this rally today wants us to believe. I will be watching for a double bottom pop on the VIX tomorrow. 

**Where am I at right now? Bearish or bullish ?**

To be honest we couldn‚Äôt have had a worse outcome today. A beat on CPI just leads to even more speculation from the markets that the Fed is going to pivot/ slow rate hikes next meeting. However, the thing is that MoM inflation did not come down and while yes these were ‚Äúbeats‚Äù under expectation and under previous its hard to say after one good reading that we beat inflation. With SPY now being over the 75% retracement line of the bear channel the risk to reward to run calls up here is very low. However, this rally could last too long and we may never see an actual drop to pay out on puts now. I don‚Äôt forsee until next CPI/ FOMC any thing big enough to actually put the markets in sell off mode. While I do think we pullback a little just to naturally fill some of this wildness I don‚Äôt think itll be too sustained. But playing calls up here just seems like playing with fire too. We are definitely in a short term play area right now.

However, lets keep this in mind‚Ä¶ 

CPI YoY- 7.7% puts us at the lowest reading since February which was 7.5%.  
 CPI MoM- 0.4% was under forecast but was the same as previous‚Ä¶ that means inflation is still increasing‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get this confused‚Ä¶ we did not DECREASE inflation‚Ä¶ it just didn‚Äôt go up as much‚Ä¶  
 CORE YoY- 6.3% is a decrease but only puts us back at September CORE of 6.3%. that means we saw core go up for one month and then come back down to the previous months numbers.   
 CORE MoM- 0.3% means after two back to back months of 0.6% MoM CORE we did finally decrease‚Ä¶.   
 

Now here is something that I already have on my radar and will be doing a lot of data diving into to figure out the best play for next CPI/ FOMC which is back to back (thinking we can really nail a banger). 

Lets chat really quickly to put it on our radars about the August drop in CPI and the august rally (mind you this is the ONLY other ‚Äúbeat‚Äù on cpi all year). 

In August CPI YoY beat at 8.5% coming down 0.2% form forecast and an impressive 0.6% from previous. The interesting thing about this prediction was that the forecast was so far below the previous with the 0.2% variance it woulda been incredible if we missed. Interestingly enough the following reading for September came in 0.2% over forecast of 8.1% but WAS a beat and decrease. Looking at the numbers for CPI YoY we have now had 5 readings in a row of CPI YoY decreasing‚Ä¶ 

CPI MoM in august was forecasted at 0.2% and came in at 0%. This is the closest we have been to a decrease in inflation all year but we have still NOT gotten an actual negative reading for MoM. After the August 0% reading we had 0.1% -&gt; 0.4% and now we have 0.4% again. So despite a BEAT of forecast CPI MoM has actually not seen a decrease to match CPI YoY. 

Since August CORE YoY of 5.9% which actually wasn‚Äôt even a beat from previous it was unchanged we had a 6.3% and now a 6.6% reading on YoY core. This reading was 0.2% beat from forecast and a 0.3% beat from previous. From the April CORE 6.5% reading until August we did see a decrease/ unchanged on core YoY. I will be closely watching to see if CORE YoY can unwind again or if we are going to go up. 

Core MoM was 0.3% in august which was a pretty impressive beat from the previous 0.7%. Much like CPI Mom we have not had a negative reading yet and we have not by any means tamed inflation but there has been slowing of CORE MoM unlike CPI MoM.

I am seeing a pretty big potential where we COULD get another good reading on inflation in December actually. Again everything comes down to the forecast. As long as the forecast comes in 0.2% below current actual readings so that would be forecast of CPI 7.5, CPI MoM 0.2, CORE 6.1 and CORE MoM 0.1% we actually could see another impressive beat and our first back to back green CPI days of the year. 

Now do I believe in real world that inflation is tamed? Absolutely not‚Ä¶ no way‚Ä¶ shit is so expensive its not funny and yeah used cars have come down (sucks more then It helps) new cars have not come down to match that used car drop. The biggest thing to watch for CPI on December 13th is 1. Will CPI YoY give its 5th consecutive drop, 2. Will CPI MoM and CORE MoM give their first negative readings (showing an actual decrease not just being unchanged) and 3. Will CORE cpi start the trend of coming down again.

The crazy bull case would be that we get back to back good readings on CPI come December 13th and then on December 14th while we still most likely get a 50bps this COULD give JPOW the fuel he needs to finally say the magical words to the market of ‚Äúwe are ready to slow hikes at the next meeting and see the full effect of our rate hikes.‚Äù A hinting at 25bps would be an pretty bullish thing and we could end up seeing December 13th and 14th turn into some impressively green two day rally based on that news. I will keep you guys posted and of course post a full trade plan and analysis/ breakdown for those two days.

Daily log- 

Today for me was an amazing day and for many in the server who played the strangle or amazingly played calls only the payout was phenomenal. After the morning win I did open one lotto put pretty early when things started to look heavy and that we wouldn‚Äôt take out 390 today, however, that quickly got wrecked. It was worth the risk to reward as I wouldn‚Äôt have in my wildest dreams expected a 5.5% green day on spy today. I am shocked we broke through 390 and that we kept pushing EOD even higher.

I played a few level to level plays on SPY but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to scalp today. For me when we are at such an extreme and as much as I want to trust it to continue I struggle to believe in my plays which makes me struggle to believe in myself and I end up cutting early or cutting red when I shouldn‚Äôt have. Days like today are better left untraded for me. 

Tomorrow is going to be interesting to say the least. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past markets to not even look back and just straight push to gap fill 403 tomorrow but I more sensibly expect a 384 to 390 pullback.

SPY

SPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday‚Äôs low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday‚Äôs low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.

QQQ

QQQ held Tuesday‚Äôs low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.

DIA

DIA also held Tuesday‚Äôs low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA‚Äôs weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders‚Äô attitude towards the market. 

XLF

The financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.

XLI

XLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium. 

Most popular tech stocks ended in the red. Apple fell 3.32% on news that the company's first AR glasses have encountered design problems, affecting the 2024 launch.

[Tesla](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-TSLA/) shares fell 7.17%, closing at their lowest level in about two years, after Musk sold at least 19.5 million shares worth $3.95 billion. Unlike the market, Tesla didn‚Äôt experience a large gap down at the open. Although it dropped 1.82% during the first 5 min, TSLA then rally back to $195.85, breaking Tuesday‚Äôs high but failed to fill the breakaway gap on Tuesday. On the daily chart, TSLA made a new low for the last two years and broke the pivot point $179.83, which was the low on 03/05/2021.

Here is my forecast based on historical CPI data and analysis. There is a chance based on Cleveland fed all miss besides CPI Yoy though. It will be a very spicy open. But something interesting to keep in mind is that this is the reddest pre-CPI day we have had since June. And for those of you who remember pretty much before July we used to get an almost standard and expected 2% intraday sell off on SPY the day before CPI‚Ä¶ it appears we just started that trend again. Tomorrow will be interesting to watch. 

Will keep todays TA brief as we will have a massive move either way and the dust will settle and we can decide where we could be headed next.

We did break through that 378 key level support which has held up and we also broke through the rising wedge on the daily that we have been trading within since the last CPI. Based on my calculations bull case puts SPY somewhere between 385.3 to 389.1 tomorrow and bear case puts us near 362.9 to 359.2. 

Key daily supports around this range is 365 -&gt; 360 

Key daily resistance around this range is 384 -&gt; 388.6

Regardless of what reading is we are about to see the next big move and direction for markets. If CPI beats and JPOW truly can say next meeting that ‚Äúinflation has slowed‚Äù and ‚Äúwe see reason finally to slow rate hikes‚Äù then we are going to see a push toward 400-420 by next CPI and FOMC (December 12/13th). However, if CPI misses (especially core and or MoM) then what JPOW said about not having inflation tamed and that it is pre-mature to even consider slowing hikes right now is about to be sang on every new outlet. If we miss I think we head down towards 320-340 before the next CPI/ FOMC in December.

Apple just closed below its last CPI candle body low of 134.9. Today tech as a whole (besides meta) looked probably the worst it has looked In a very long time. This further tells me that a CPI miss is not price in and that tech especially will get absolutely slaughtered. 

Looking at previous CPIs 5-6% movement is possible on Apple that gives us a possible 127.8 to 126.5 tomorrow which would be a new 52 week low for Apple‚Ä¶ actually Apple right here is 4.4% from its 52 week low at close of market today. This is the first close below 138.4 support level since June of this year.

Zoomed out on tesla is beyond ugly and I feel like this thing is just going to get driven down until it closes under $100/ share. Currently 172.2 support is the 2022 bear channel on Tesla if that level breaks then there is just the massive weekly bear channel left as you can see. This also potentially will be the first close under the weekly 200ema since October 2019.

The VIX remains hella underwhelming putting in a mild 2.15% green day on the eve of CPI. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the VIX somewhere between 27 and 28.3 at open tomorrow and we could breach 30 if CPI misses that big. 

Daily log- 

Honestly I struggled today with the technical. A lot of oversold indicators then pushing $1-$2 through that level to then reverse then push further. I got stopped out a few times only for it to go green and I didn‚Äôt close green for it to reverse on me too. Overall ended green thanks to a few scalps but tough day for me. 

See what tomorrow brings with CPI.

Recently, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/)'s company, [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/berkshire-hathaway-holding-stocks/), reported third-quarter earnings with revenue of $76.934 billion, up 9% from $70.583 billion in the same period last year; net loss of $2.688 billion compared with a profit of $10.344 billion in the same period last year, but was sharply narrower than the $43.755 billion loss in the second quarter.

For the full year, revenue for the first three quarters of 2022 was $223.924 billion, up slightly from last year's $204.296 billion. But it lost $40.983 billion in the first three quarters of this year, compared with a profit of $50.149 billion in the same period last year, due to a poor investment environment.

Judging from [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/)'s performance this year, it's not so bad.

As early as the first quarter of this year, in fact, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) is still bucking the trend of growth. He changed his regular strategy for the past 5 years and increased the intensity of investment. In total, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) bought $51.8 billion of shares in the first quarter and sold $10.3 billion, according to his earnings report. His cash pile fell from $143.9 billion to $102.7 billion at the end of the quarter.

After the general direction was set in the first quarter, its position has been small changes, more persistent is to continue to buy western oil.

Specifically, Berkshire lost $13.465 billion on investments and derivatives contracts in the third quarter, bringing its losses to $82.362 billion in the first three quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gi7nprm22wy91...*

In terms of total holdings, Berkshire's market value is $306.167 billion so far, compared with $350,719 billion at the same time last year. That represents a decline of about $50 billion over the course of a year. The changes in the market value of these positions are not from losses caused by active adjustments, but losses caused by passive declines in the stocks they hold.

 

https://preview.redd.it/r0brm5g32wy91.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75cfc448c824b2b23f0f168b8723813984e9d9b3

According to the earnings report, Berkshire's top five holdings were unchanged, as follows:

First, Apple, with a market capitalization of $126.5 billion. According to statistics, so far this year, Apple's stock price has fallen by 21.03%. From the perspective of position contribution, Apple's position has contributed more than half of the loss limit.

Second, Bank of America, with $31.2 billion in market value. Bank of America is down 15.37% for the year;

Third, Chevron, with a market capitalization of $24.4 billion. Although it rose 63.89% in the year, but the overall position is small, the impact on the entire position is not big;

Fourth, Coca-Cola, with an open position of $22.4 billion. This year's increase of 2.95%, it is reported that this has been the fourteen consecutive years of Coca-Cola increase;

Fifth, American Express, with an open position of $20.5 billion. It was down 7.06% for the year.

In terms of overall holdings, Berkshire's major investment losses are from Apple stock, so over time, for [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/), he will focus more on operating profit. Berkshire reported operating income of $7.761 billion in the third quarter, compared with $6.466 billion in the same period last year. Operating income for the first three quarters was $24.084 billion, compared with $20.17 billion in the same period last year. On that measure, [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) still beats the market by a wide margin.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 8.74% this year, while [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/berkshire-hathaway-holding-stocks/) A is down just 1.9%, so Berkshire is also beating the index.

The results also showed that Berkshire still had $109 billion in cash on its books at the end of the third quarter, a slight increase from $105.4 billion in the previous quarter.

Taken together, the big cash flow on Berkshire's books is still a reflection of the market's weakness, and while [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/) has been buying Occidental oil all year, it's not enough to change [Buffett](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/smoke-together-with-warren-buffett-stocks/)'s overall position structure.

Berkshire's earnings are likely to be tied to Apple's stock for a long time to come, until Berkshire breaks its structure and realigns its position.","Earnings Express| With A $40.98 Billion Loss in the First Three Quarters, Apple ‚ÄòTied Up‚Äô Buffett?",1.0,2022-11-09 08:50:23

The last 4 daily candles are completely ugly with all these massive wicks and huge ranges and volatility. But we reconfirmed 378 as support on that huge sell off intraday and I am looking for 388 to 390 tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day before CPI there is a very likely scenario where we trade between 378 and 384 all day in anticipation of CPI. This would be much like October 31st if that happens. However, if we look at September CPI (highlighted by the blue circle) despite the difference in candle structure we are actually seeing a VERY similar set up. We had a bounce off a key support level (September was 390 and now is 370.5) and that was followed by 4 green days (for a total of 5.5%... we are currently at 2.1%). We could see a bigger push tomorrow to that 390 level which would get us about 5.4% rally over 4 days prior to CPI. 

If you remember September the market was pretty bullish back then too and was under the anticipation that CPI would beat pretty bigly. However, it missed huge and back then much like now the market was Not prepared for a huge miss on CPI. 

When I look at the VIX now and IV compared to the last few CPIs the vix is extremely low and IV rank/ IV is very low. For instance today IV was around 30-32 which last CPI was 40-50. The market is not hedged for a huge miss or a huge CPI dump‚Ä¶ I stand by if we get a big miss (read my cpi trade plan posted under pre-market analysis) that we might get our biggest red open and we might see a repeat of September also.

I didn‚Äôt talk about it under SPY but futures much like spy did break that FOMC resistance line today. We are holding that 3805 as support nicely, however, hard rejected at 3865. I am looking for futes to retest 3865 tomorrow and push for next major resistance at 3925. A rejection at 3925 and SPY 390 would actually form a really nice daily double top prior to a bad CPI reading and could be the ‚Äútop‚Äù for a while.

Apple once again managed to hold that 138.3 support line and actually broke its steep red bear channel. With that tomorrow we can look for some upside and that 145 gap fill is still on the table if we get a big enough green day for markets.

And then there was tesla‚Ä¶ once again another massively red sell off on tesla, however, this time it had a nice intraday recovery. Tesla is now down $37.05 in 3 days and $50.65 total over the last 6 days. That is a pretty insane sell off on Tesla. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the weekly ( I don‚Äôt usually talk about the weekly chart intraweek but this one is important to show). On that morning sell off Tesla hit its weekly 200ema. This is the first time Tesla has touched the weekly 200ema since October 2019. Even during the covid crash tesla never touched its 200ema on the weekly. It did touch and bounce aggressively off its 100ema though. 

If Tesla is going to bounce‚Ä¶ this is the best chance it has. In addition unless Tesla opens under 182.4 -3.7% it will break its red dotted aggressive 3 day sell off resistance line and I believe attempt to go for its 197 gap fill tomorrow. 

Key support- 191.3-&gt; 186.6 -&gt; 172.5

The VIX is at a very interesting crossroads here‚Ä¶ it is holding now in a consolidation pattern 24.4 to 25.8 and remains in its downward bear channel. 

The June CPI which from these levels resulted in a 3 day spike of the VIX for 32.1% was at 23.8 the day before CPI. The June 10th CPI resulted in a -1.66% open and closed down -2.9%.

The July CPI was at 25.79 two days before CPI and resulted in a smaller 11.3% spike over 3 today. The July CPI opened down -1.52% but closed only down -0.52%. 

The September CPI was at 22.64 two days before CPI and resulted in a 3 day spike of 19.6%. The September CPI opened down -2.2% (the reddest CPI open) and closed down -4.35%. 

We COULD expect a 21% spike on the VIX starting today through Thursday EOD. This means Thursday the VIX should hit 29.3. But realistically could end up somewhere between 26.9 and 31.9 on Thursday. We also COULD be looking for about a -1.79% red open (or somewhere between -1.5% to -2.2% Thursday morning) if CPI misses. 

The thing to keep in mind at least for me is that this market much like September is not in any shape or form position for a big miss. I also do not think if we do miss we see a repeat of October or July because back then we were at the 52week low and people were HEAVILY hedged with puts. But now that people are not positioned that way it will be much harder for us to rally intraday especially with the VIX so low.

I don‚Äôt study the P/C ratio as I feel its never helped and is just a data point but currently the P/C is 2.34% and the IV is 41.3% which is relatively low IV wise compared to the last CPI where were near 50. The call volume actually greatly outweighs the put volume (maybe someone can explain this better then me) but the actual put OI is much higher then the Call OI.

Today was a pretty good day‚Ä¶ not going to lie not being greedy saved me about 4 different times from getting wrecked‚Ä¶ I luckily opened that tesla call at a lotto size and was able to average down and get out with a smaller loss but still not great. 

Interestingly enough data wise for me today I went 100% with SPX scalps (weeks win rate is 90.9%), and my level to level plays intraday on spy were also 100% win rate (with the weekly win rate being 85.7% for just spy level to levels). However, I am 0 for 2 this week on tesla L2L plays and last week I hit 71.5% win rate‚Ä¶ for the last two weeks for just Tesla L2Ls I am averaging 55.5% win rate‚Ä¶. For the last two weeks my P/L $ on Tesla L2Ls alone is -$389 and last week with my 71.5% win rate I had a P/L$ of $1279.

I had that 60% loss yesterday on Tesla (shoulda been cut at -30%) that if it was not for that I would be profitable on my L2Ls. But I like to anlayze my trades to see if what im doing is working or not. I will be keeping a close eye on this the rest of week and next week to see if there is a case to stop my Tesla L2Ls and stick to strictly SPY.

Despite the struggle almost all day for SPY to break through 370 resistance we finally saw spy break through before power hour and end the day extremely bullish. The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. 

However, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday. 

Support- 378 -&gt; 376.2 -&gt; 374.7 -&gt; 371.4

Futures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It‚Äôs a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. 

If 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s.

Apple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill.

And then there was Tesla‚Ä¶. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. 

Highlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom.

The VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn‚Äôt hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days‚Ä¶ the VIX has either closed red OR closed &lt;1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart.

Looking at the fear and greed index‚Ä¶ we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot‚Ä¶ from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. 

The current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  

Januarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  
 Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  
 Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  
   
 

That would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days‚Ä¶ that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th‚Ä¶. 

Now hear me out on this one which is even more WILD‚Ä¶ December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)‚Ä¶. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible‚Ä¶ 

Something to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week. 

Daily log- 

Today was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn‚Äôt miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it‚Ä¶ though I wouldn‚Äôt have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o3mcji9mrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28b6552ea94c4714d5fce056b25a70f6405f6f37

Something important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. 

The best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week‚Ä¶ every trade is a new chance‚Ä¶ If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. 

Something I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play. I don‚Äôt want to get in a habit of that with these level to levels even though I know sometimes they need time to mature‚Ä¶ this COULD result in a lower win rate as I may stop out more BUT for instance today had I stopped out on my Tesla and SPY level to levels that closed very red I would have ended up very green today. 

Actually had a capped my L2L plays at -25% today for the two losers I would have only closed down -$50 for my L2L plays and with my $1249 from scalps today woulda ended the day up $1199 instead im ending it down about $103.

Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a solid gain in operating profits during the third quarter despite rising recession fears, while Warren Buffett kept buying back his stock at a modest pace.

The Omaha-based conglomerate‚Äôs operating earnings ‚Äî which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities ‚Äî totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.

Insurance-investment income came in at $1.408 billion, up from $1.161 billion a year earlier. Earnings from the company‚Äôs utilities and energy businesses came in at $1.585 billion, up from $1.496 billion year over year. Insurance underwriting suffered a loss of 962 million, however, while railroad earnings dipped to $1.442 billion from $1.538 billion in 2021.

Berkshire spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion. The pace of buyback was in line with the $1 billion purchased in the second quarter. Repurchases were well below CFRA‚Äôs expectation as its analyst estimated it would be similar to the $3.2 billion total in the first quarter.

However, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire‚Äôs equity investments amid the market‚Äôs rollercoaster ride.

Berkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is ‚Äúusually meaningless.‚Äù

Apple said in a statement on Sunday that it has temporarily reduced iPhone 14 production because of Covid-19 restrictions at its primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly plant in Zhengzhou, China.

The factory, operated by Foxconn, is operating at ‚Äúsignificantly reduced capacity,‚Äù Apple said. It warned that it would ship fewer units and that customers would experience longer wait times when ordering devices.

Apple‚Äôs warning brings up the possibility that it may sell fewer iPhones in the December quarter because it is having trouble making enough to meet demand. It previously signaled slowing growth in the December quarter last month.

It said that it continues to see strong demand for the affected models, which are higher-priced than other iPhone models and start at $999 and $1099.

In the past week, China has ordered lockdowns in Zhengzhou, where Apple does the majority of its iPhone production. The factory in China has grappled with employees fleeing the facility because of its Covid policies and outbreaks, according to Reuters.

China continues to pursue a ‚Äúzero-Covid‚Äù policy that requires facilities like the iPhone facility in Zhengzhou to operate as ‚Äúclosed loops,‚Äù where workers isolate in dorms and work in factories separated from the outside world.

It currently takes 31 days to receive an iPhone 14 Pro if ordered from Apple‚Äôs website, longer than the average 2-day lead time for less-expensive iPhone models, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a note on Sunday.

This new post is v2 of his original response.

Before we dive in... For those that don't know Netlist and what they do, read the following. Otherwise, feel free to skip ahead if you do know them already.

# About Netlist (NLST)

[**Netlist**](https://netlist.com/), which was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Irvine, California, is a leading provider of high-performance modular memory subsystems to the world‚Äôs premier OEMs. The company specializes in hybrid memory, combining DRAM and NAND flash raw materials to create memory solutions. Their patented memory technologies provide superior performance and high density at a cost-efficient price, with use spanning a broad variety of markets and functions ‚Äì a market that only expands as technology use grows.

Netlist has a long history of being the first to market with disruptive new products. For example, they were the first to develop the load-reduced DIMM, HyperCloud¬Æ, which was based on Netlist‚Äôs distributed buffer architecture. This architecture was later adopted by the industry for DDR4 LRDIMM. Netlist was also the first to bring NAND flash to the memory channel with their NVvault¬Æ NVDIMM. These innovative products were built on Netlist‚Äôs early pioneering work in areas such as embedding passives into printed circuit boards to free up board real estate; doubling densities via quad-rank double data rate (DDR) technology, and other off-chip technology advances that result in improved performance and lower costs compared to conventional memory.

Netlist is continuing this tradition with the introduction of HybriDIMM, the industry‚Äôs first Storage Class Memory product built on commodity DRAM and flash. HybriDIMM is the first SCM product to operate in current Intel¬Æ x86 servers without BIOS and hardware changes, and the first unified DRAM-NAND solution that scales memory to terabyte storage capacities and accelerates storage to nanosecond memory speeds.

Netlist has a broad portfolio of patents, many of which are seminal, in the areas of hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication, and load reduction, among others. The size of Netlist‚Äôs patent portfolio reflects its extensive research and development over the years, as well as its history of bringing innovative new products to market.

Netlist‚Äôs strategy is to combine its unique board-level intellectual property with a thorough understanding of semiconductor building blocks and system-level applications to deliver performance, cost, and time-to-market advantages to OEMs. This strategy is made capable with state-of-the-art, wholly owned, ISO- and OSHAS-certified manufacturing and testing facilities in Suzhou, China.

# A Forerunner To What Could Be America‚Äôs Largest Patent Infringement In History

Google was presented with Netlist technology in the mid-2000s under an NDA. Google test-drove the product, and they liked it a lot. What they did not like and fought against was the cost Netlist wanted (per Google‚Äôs argument). Netlist alleges that they decided to steal the product by making it themselves or coercing other manufacturers to create copycat versions of the technology to bypass any royalties to Netlist. In 2009 Netlist officially brought forth a lawsuit. The judge in the 2009 case ordered a random cross-section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. In that time frame (the mid-2000s to now), Google went from being one of several competing search engine/email providers (AOL, Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, Bing, etc.) to have a practical monopoly on the entire market due to the broader storage and retrieval capabilities. This leads Netlist to assume that their intellectual property is one of the direct reasons why.

Netlist has 130+ patents, and with all ongoing litigation, there are roughly a dozen patents in question across Micron, Samsung, and Google. The biggest of which is the 912 patent.

Google's priority was to invalidate Netlist‚Äôs patents since they had no argument for innocence (already caught red-handed with the technology described in the 912 patent specifically). With this and other patent disputes arising, certain authority figures in law and patent litigation (many of whom overlap with the same legal council that has represented Google and others in the past) arranged to create the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) as a way to capitalize on the complex and growing field of intellectual property law. This board was formally founded in 2012. The PTAB is supposed to represent an objective third-party resource to review patent validity and make the legal landscape much cleaner to navigate for district courts handling disputes. In reality, it seems to be an entity fueled by big tech to invalidate patents to get out of paying appropriate royalties for fair use. The PTAB is paid case by case, so they are unfairly incentivized to take on cases. Moreover, the judges have been discovered to regularly get kickbacks or bonuses on patents they can invalidate. These IPRs take a year on average. When a big tech company steals a smaller company‚Äôs intellectual property, it will use the PTAB to request a stay on the case pending the review. It is easy and understandable for a district judge, who is paid a salary no matter how many cases they see, to accept the stay as it simply cleans their docket for the moment. Then post-review, a district judge will often adopt the PTAB‚Äôs decision as their own without question. For reasons you may speculate, district judges have the authority to question or disregard PTAB at their discretion but often do not. Big tech has deep pockets and is happy to pay for this service as it is often much cheaper in the long run than paying fair royalties.

The PTAB grants reviews on over 70% of all requests, knowing that conservatively 50% of these reviews stand no chance of invalidation in whole or even part. Also, the PTAB allows multiple companies to request and have practically identical IPRs granted when reviewing similar patents - most of the time only enabling more time to be wasted at the detriment of the patent holder. In several instances, these little companies go out of business, allowing big tech companies to absorb their patents whether invalidated or not.

Netlist is a rare example of a company that has only improved over time despite the odds and has more cash on hand, better sales, stronger hiring numbers, and increased r&amp;d in the meantime. So they are more than able to go the distance and see justice served.

# The ‚Äò912 Patent

A description of the '912 patent is [**found here**](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/08/04/netlist-progresses-in-samsung-dimm-patent-case-with-google-in-its-sights/)**.**  


&gt;The ‚Äò912 patent refers to the use of rank multiplication in an LRDIMM (Long Range DIMM) memory module. Such DIMMs can have four ranks or blocks of memory, and the patent describes IP to present the LRDIMM logically as only having two ranks, thus getting over system memory controller limits on the maximum rank count.  
Agni Research explained ‚ÄúNetlist asserts that the ‚Äò912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning-fast search results. The ‚Äò912 patent played a large part in Google‚Äôs dominance in search.‚Äù

Spanning a decade (which is unprecedented), Netlist and Google have fought over the 912 patent. It went through several reviews, appeals, etc. until being validated at the federal circuit in 2020 unanimously as SEMINAL and valid. The status of seminal indicates that it is a patented product that gives users a tremendous advantage and thus, explaining why Google went from one of many to the monopoly of the industry making trillions since. This is unwavering. Google withdrew its right to appeal further to the Supreme Court as this historic rule 36 style verdict (where the federal circuit affirmed lower court's rulings without any input or amendment) has never been overturned at the Supreme Court level. Google then tried to invalidate all 78 claims of the 912 patent for past infringement (accepting the claims and 912 validity from the time it was recognized in court and post-any ‚Äúamendments‚Äù done by Netlist to update/rewrite the claims as they are relevant today). So 2021 to the present, as well as future royalties Google acknowledges and will pay for. They are simply playing damage control on how much money this is going to cost them - and a guilty verdict on past infringement spanning over a decade can be worth billions.

The next battle was with ‚Äúclaim 16 intervening rights‚Äù, as it was the only claim out of 78 to survive back to inception/infringement and is worth a substantial amount. As momentum built towards the claim 16 hearing in November 2021, the night before the hearing Judge Armstrong in the Northern District of California stayed the case for no clear reason for 3 months (it was assumed personal undetermined reasons). 3 months later she did a second consecutive stay. At that time she was offloading several cases and not hearing any, so it was likely for personal reasons and unrelated to the case itself.

This delay was unacceptable, so we switched judges successfully to Judge Seeborg. Seeborg went through with the claim 16 intervening rights hearing and ruled in favor of Netlist that Google is on the hook for 4-rank DDR4 DIMMs (a product that was used by Google between 2014-2020).

Google was successful in limiting its exposure by avoiding 8-rank and 16-rank DDR4 DIMMs. A settlement would likely not come close to the actual cost of all infringed products multiplied over years, but this claim 16 ddr4 rank 4 victory alone could manifest in the largest patent infringement in US history (the current record is $2.54 Billion).

# Google Is Not The Only One In Trouble

In related cases within the same timeframe, Netlist sued SK Hynix, Inphi, Micron, and Samsung (amongst others like Diablo and Sandisk). Samsung, in particular, had a contract with Netlist from 2015-2020 ish, but early on there was compelling evidence that Samsung was in breach of the contract and not fulfilling its obligations to Netlist. So Netlist unilaterally withdrew their contract and Samsung fought it in a breach of contract suit, ultimately losing as they were proven to be in breach in December 2021. It was tricky because Netlist was only allowed to give limited info to a jury at that trial and the jury saw the contract was breached and should be voided but awarded no damages. The jury deliberated quickly on a Friday evening and it was seen as a miscarriage of justice as you cannot have a breach without there being clear damages. The judge came back and granted Netlist nominal damages so that the breach would be legal and binding in February 2022. Samsung is currently in appeals with this suit but it‚Äôs not a strong case for them at all.

To throw another variable in the mix, SK Hynix in spring 2021 got to the Markman Claim Construction trial (despite requesting stays for ongoing IPRs) and they were forced to decide between the discovery of their records or settling outside of court. An overwhelming majority (90%+) of these cases settle outside of court around this event. When companies run out of time-wasting ammo, they don‚Äôt want their dirty laundry seen in the litigation public domain (because it's either a losing battle or possibly because it could further incriminate them with a plethora of other less-than-ethical business practices). Four weeks after the Markman hearing SK Hynix settled. $40 million in damages (pretty nominal) and a $640 million product sharing agreement so Netlist could have access to SK Hynix manufacturing at a discount to sell and pursue other smaller markets. This has already proven to be worth more than the initial agreement and has been very advantageous for both Netlist and SK Hynix.

Google was on the verge of either showing its cards or settling. Samsung had no solid contract to stand on, SK Hynix already settled, and Inphi's trial was withdrawn without prejudice. Perhaps Inphi agreed to share incriminating information about Google/others on behalf of Netlist. Their infringement was limited in scope and they were since bought out by Marvell. Begs the question that maybe they wanted to avoid carrying over legal issues to the new firm. This is yet to be determined, but it was done without prejudice, meaning Netlist can always reinstate the lawsuit if they wish. Additionally, Netlist's verbiage has changed on motions filed from ‚Äúon belief‚Äù to ‚Äúon information and belief‚Äù - it leads us to speculate that Inphi could be providing information. The micron trial was also gaining momentum for several patents and was recently added to those that infringe on the 912 as well. Half the patents are in the West District of Texas (where there is a stay on the case currently) and the other half is being tried in the East District of Texas with judges who are not as prone to stay - more on that to come.

The 6 months of stagnation really hurt Netlist's momentum but morale was still high. Then Samsung blindsides us with a Delaware suit against Netlist where they requested a 912 inter partes review (a NEW trial proceeding to review 912's patentability) with the PTAB - something that was already reviewed 5 times and went to the highest court in the land and deemed SEMINAL meaning transformative to the industry. This particular product cut energy costs by 50-95% and significantly increased search/retrieval speed. No wonder Google became the monopoly they are today. So this was very puzzling because why would Samsung request this 912 review considering that Netlist wasn‚Äôt even suing Samsung over that patent?

...Moreover, since the patent is already valid, it CAN NOT be overturned, but Seeborg's ruling on claim 16 potentially can. The Google case was stayed for 90 days until there could be clarification as to what exactly is going on with this tactic.

# Recent &amp; Developing Events - Fall 2022

The PTAB in October 2022 disappointingly granted an IPR (not surprising given their unobjective big tech bias) on the basis that the claim 16 definition of ‚Äúrank‚Äù multiplication differs ever so slightly from a definition of rank used in one of Netlist's older patents. So it‚Äôs a simple wording technicality. It‚Äôs difficult because rank wasn‚Äôt introduced until the DDR4 DIMMs so that‚Äôs what‚Äôs being fought over. Same technology and method, just some use more material. By definition the core requirement of rank is to have at least 2 or more memory devices in order to wire them to achieve high memory capacity with lower DIMMs‚Ä¶but never only 1 DIMM because that doesn‚Äôt help to achieve low-cost high memory capacity - which is the entire aim of the patent 912. Samsung argues the definition should mean ‚Äúone or more‚Äù whereas Netlist argues ‚Äútwo or more‚Äù as the use of rank implies that there is a row (or more than one). According to Wikipedia, ‚Äúa memory rank is a set of DRAM chips connected to the same chip select, which are therefore accessed simultaneously‚Äù. Even the internet uses the word SET! A set can never imply a single unit. A single-rank DIMM has one SET of memory chips that is accessed while writing or reading from the memory. A dual-rank DIMM is similar to having 2 single-rank DIMMs on the same module, with only one rank accessible at the time. A quad-rank DIMM is, effectively, 2 dual-rank DIMMs on the same module. Samsung is trying to change the definition or sneakily imply that Netlist is only entitled to single-chip servers potentially, instead of stacked servers which is what Google primarily uses.

It is more disappointing by how obviously it appears that Samsung and Google are parties of interest. This has been overlooked by PTAB since Samsung skirted around any direct answer to there being an indemnification agreement between the two. To explain PTABs blind eye to this sort of thing, in 2019 in an unrelated case against SEVEN Networks, LLC, Google was able to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù the PTAB that its parent company Alphabet, which oversees and controls Google, was not a real party of interest- so go figure. This is one of many examples of all that is wrong with the PTAB as an institution, and why the tribunal is hopelessly broken and in need of a complete teardown and rebuild.

On 11/3/22, Irell and Manella attorney Philip Warrick requested that the PTAB convene a Precedential Opinion Panel in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 2 (revision10) to rehear the panel decision, asses the basis of Google‚Äôs real-party-of-interest (RPI) status as well as the ‚Äúsecond bite at the apple‚Äù standard prohibiting consecutive wasteful IPRs on the same patent, and REVERSE the panel‚Äôs institution decision. The facts presented are clear that the PTAB committed a blatant injustice in allowing the IPR on the merits of the claim alone and the fact that Samsung admitted in the declaratory judgment action complaint to requesting the IPR in order to indemnify Google upon Google‚Äôs request. Clear party of interest. PTAB failed to have Samsung defend that Google is NOT a party of interest - as it was not Netlist‚Äôs burden of proof in a typical procedure. Mr. Warrick presented 6 case study references to show evidence that PTAB acted unorthodoxly and antagonistically to establish a precedent. Even if the odds are down to a coin flip, it is very promising!

It is important to know that Google and Samsung have worked together often in the past decade to muddy IP litigations, double dip on time-wasting opportunities, and even fund each other's lawsuit defenses. There is no limit to the deceptive practices they are comfortable using. This includes incorrect annotations on word-limited motions to unfairly use more words to argue their case, manipulatively using the PTAB while being clear parties of interest together, lobbying legislation and political/judicial individuals, etc. If we simple retail investors can see this from publicly available information, then so can the ethical honorable legal representatives working to see justice prevail. Needless to say, reform is absolutely needed. With this news, Google and Netlist agreed to stay the Google case until the Samsung case wraps up as this is the final straw Google has to stand on. The consolation prize to all this is that Samsung was cornered into the Eastern District of Texas with judge Gilstrap.

Judge Gilstrap has seen over 25% of the nation's entire patent litigation cases! He does not slow down for unnecessary time wasters and has a history of denying PTAB IPR-based requests for stay. Samsung and Micron are caught up in Gilstrap's web, unable to escape despite their many requests to stay or transfer to another district. Judge Gilstrap is adamant that the similar patents across Micron and Samsung be tried together for efficiency even though a few of Micron's patents are tied in the Western District of Texas and currently ‚Äústayed‚Äù.

As of today, Gilstrap is moving forward with the trials and Samsung just had their Markman Trial with Magistrate Payne (a pretrial hearing in the U.S. District Court during which a judge examines evidence from all parties on the appropriate meanings of relevant keywords used in a patent claim) on November 4th, 2022 for a basket of patents not involving the 912. On 11/17 there‚Äôs a case management conference scheduled to set up a Markman Trial date for the 912 and other patents with Gilstrap.

A wild card in all this is that Gilstrap's daughter sadly passed away recently. I am unsure of how much time he will take away to grieve. Family comes first.

If Gilstrap can push through and get one or both Samsung and Micron to be compelled into discovery, the chances are strong that they will offer a settlement instead of showing their dirty laundry just as SK Hynix did. The hope is Gilstrap will not be entertaining any more stays despite ongoing IPRs on some patents. Gilstrap is the authority, not the PTAB so ultimately nothing they do matters if Gilstrap is adamant about keeping the case moving, which outside of his family tragedy, he has shown no desire to waste time.

Judge Gilstrap often utilizes the expertise of Magistrate Payne in the same ED of Texas to oversee a majority of Markman claim construction hearings. Judge Payne has construed a significantly HIGH number of patent claim terms (over 8,200 terms as of 2022) - the highest claim construction record of all time compared to other judges in past polls or rankings. Moreover, in terms of actual Markman trials conducted, Judge Payne ranks among the top five federal judges, magistrates, or districts, who have conducted the most hearings of all time. Gilstrap is also in that rank.

Payne and Gilstrap have already had cases against Netlist‚Äôs infringers (Google, Samsung, etc) before, and they are NOT friendly to them. As one example, back in 2014 in SimpleAir, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., et al, 2:13-cv-416-JRG, an east Texas jury entered a damages verdict against Google for $85 million for patent infringement. In this lawsuit, most of the defendants, including Microsoft, chose to settle. Google, however, proceeded to trial. On Jan 18th of that year, the East Texas jury entered a verdict against Google finding that it infringed on the ‚Äò914 and ‚Äò433 patents which were deemed valid. The jury struggled at first to reach a determination on the issue of damages of which Google moved for a new trial on all issues. The Honorable Judge Gilstrap DENIED Google‚Äôs motion and set dates for jury selection and trial on just the issue of damages on March 17th and by the 19th the jury entered its official verdict for $85 million!

In two separate recent cases involving Samsung (Uniloc 2017 LLC v. Samsung Elecs. America, Inc in 2020 and Staton Techiya, LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co 2022), Judge Payne repeatedly denied Samsungs request for stay due to ongoing appeals or third-party IPRs, respectively.

On 11/4 the Markman Claim Construction hearing took place over the 054, 506, 339, 918, 060, and 160 patents. Payne asked several questions to Samsung throughout the trial every time Samsung presented arguments and he was mildly arguing with them. The only patent that Payne seemed to question for clarification on the netlist side was the 339 patent. Netlist attorney answered very matter of fact. Samsung's attorney was very long-winded. For perspective, the more the judge needs to ask questions, the worse it is. Claim construction needs to be simple and concise. Not a complicated word salad consisting of several paragraphs. It appears Samsung tried really hard to finagle things to their advantage and it seems Payne was not entertaining it. We look to hearing in the near future about Payne‚Äôs final decisions on claims and move forward from there.

**In the meantime, all court Jury trials have been proposed and go as follows:**  


* May 2023 - Samsung Texas Jury Trial over non-912 patents
* May 2023 - Germany Jury trial (Samsung, Google, and Micron)
* January 2024 - Micron Texas Jury trial
* February 2025 - Samsung/Google Delaware Jury Trial

Often these disputes settle outside of court before Jury trial. Netlist does not have the resources to continue paying legal fees and support a weak market demand (as seen in q3 2022 results and hinted that will continue for one or two more quarters) if nothing were to be resolved until the latest trial date established without having to dilute shares or dip into their line of credit available. That is something to be aware of but not frightened by. Many opportunities for settlement before that time. It is safe to assume a strong stock price recovery within 7-8 months from now with the hopes of the Samsung Texas case going to a jury trial or settling outside of court.

The first company to settle will lose the least. All other companies will likely fold shortly afterward. Once Samsung folds, Google will too. In my opinion, it is not a question of guilt or innocence at this point, but of who won and how much the winner will be compensated. Since they have been fighting so hard for so long, it leads many to believe the damages and future licensing could be substantial across all companies.

# Future Stock Price Speculation

To emphasize a similar legal battle against Googe we must understand the Vringo case 2012-2014. Vringo owned 2 patents on AdWords and AdSense (software that increases search engine optimization for advertisements on search engines) and the judge ruled in favor of Vringo and it went to a jury trial. The jury awarded damages (30 million) and a percentage of royalties moving forward. This was re-examined by the USPTO (now PTABs job) and both patents were able to survive the IPR intact (but not seminal). It was then taken through the first round of appeals on the merits of the whole case. They agreed with the district judges ruling and jury ruling and even doubled the original royalty percentage!

Then in the federal circuit of appeals, one judge out of 3 showed reasonable doubt to the patent validity (basically saying the patents weren‚Äôt special and they were so easy a caveman could do it) and everything fell apart and all winnings reversed. The company still exists but went private and rebranded. It was a major rug pull after everything was won and verified many times.

Our 912 patent has survived where Vringo‚Äôs patents failed at the federal circuit of appeals. However, this is a tactic that worries me with all other patents not already seminally verified by the federal circuit of appeals if there is not a settlement outside of court.

It is worth noting that the single judge to discredit Vringo‚Äôs patent was Judge Raymond Chen. He was appointed to the Federal Circuit of Appeals in 2013 by President Obama. Obama‚Äôs biggest political donor: Google.

Even if this isn‚Äôt the biggest settlement in history, it‚Äôs still substantial and the future licensing is worth more. With settlements in place, Netlist should be deep in the black and placed back on the NASDAQ instead of staying OTC as soon as they reinstate a Board of Directors. Plus, Netlist has an ace in the hole with future Hybridimm technology of which the CEO, Chuck Hong, says is worth more than $10B annually and already patent-protected. Netlist has all the makings of being the industry leader in memory storage technology. Search engines, streaming services, email, social media, cars, etc all need this technology and many are already using Netlist's tech without properly paying. They will all pay especially with the legitimacy of these litigations behind us.

As stated previously 90%+ of these cases settle before jury trial and before discovery into the infringer's records. So that‚Äôs the rough timeline to anticipate prior to jury trials listed above.

For perspective, in 1999 Qualcomm sued/won against Ericsson and Motorola in a seminal patent victory and within 12 months post-settlement the stock went from $3-$90 (settling longer term around the $60 range). This was during the dot com bubble when the rest of the market crashed. I anticipate similar results with Netlist given enough timeline post settlements.

I compare Netlist's technology similarly to how revolutionary NVDA tech was back in 2016. In 5 years NVDA went from roughly $20 to $700. If Netlist can garner the right licensing and their future tech is as magnificent as Hong states, then that‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility.

In desperation, Google had an agreement with the government and the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in Sept 2022 to pay for microchips to be built by SkyWater to use as open-source research and development for future microchip technology. Why would Google be so generous? Perhaps it‚Äôs their Hail Mary attempt to design around Netlist patents so they don‚Äôt hemorrhage money paying for fair use. My thoughts are if they haven‚Äôt designed around the tech already in the last 15 years, they won‚Äôt be able to now. And you better believe they‚Äôve tried.

Netlist is a true David and Goliath story where big tech has fought harder than ever to not have to pay for Netlist tech. Why fight so hard if it‚Äôs worthless? Why settle with other companies often and not Netlist? Most litigation + appeals take 2 to 4 years. This has lasted more than 3 times longer than that and still counting.

The risk of Netlist losing and getting paid nothing is not even relevant as Google accepts the terms of the 912 patent and their infringement from 2021 to the present. Netlist is not a patent troll and they have an underlying business that is flourishing despite the litigations. The risk is more so to the time and patience of retail investors. On OTC there‚Äôs also the element of broker/dealer price discretions as well as more manipulation from market makers who like to trade round lots consecutively throughout the day to walk the price down.

The way I see it, this is a powder keg waiting to explode and these prices are very enticing. If there‚Äôs a worst-case scenario event and things drag out as long as possible, the underlying company itself in a bad economic environment is still worth $0.80 - $1.20. So it‚Äôs not likely to go to 0 and go bankrupt.

The stock hit $10 on the Sk Hynix settlement and the exuberance of the noose closing in on google + others next. Progress has been made on all cases since that time only reinforcing the merits Netlist has on all fronts. The SK Hynix settlement was anticipated to be the weakest settlement of all current ongoing cases. The stays to the case for specific periods made the stock ripe for manipulation and impatience which is why the stock price has walked down most of the year (9 months of the last 12-month period have been in a stay). Many who are bullish long-term took the chance to trade the stock around the catalyst dates in the meantime, adding to short-term volatility. Longs will probably add more without selling the closer we get to finalized court decisions.

For me, it‚Äôs a no-brainer, easy to hold and I have time. For others, they must weigh the pros and cons of the entry price and duration of holding. I argue it‚Äôs a long-term hold with lots of tailwinds in the future. With positive earnings post settlement and relisting to NASDAQ, this could be astronomical as THEN institutional investors and FOMO retail will likely buy like crazy. Combine that with the short float outstanding and there‚Äôs truly no telling where the SP (stock price) goes.

Safe to assume $10 to $30 as a soft initial SP target POST settlements‚Ä¶which WILL most likely happen in time. Could be sooner rather than later and happen outside of court if these companies are cornered into discovery.

# A Final Message From [u/DaveySauce](https://www.reddit.com/u/DaveySauce/)

I‚Äôm happy to open up to any feedback or input on the matter as I didn‚Äôt discuss all the other relevant patents and progress made on that front.

Best of luck to all investors‚Ä¶but know that truly good investors are not as lucky as they are patient - relying on their wisdom and research and then simply succeeding on purpose. Warren Buffett said the stock market is a device that takes money from the impatient and gives it to the patient. Never invest more than you are willing to lose. Many investors bought in for pennies and are already in the black. For newer investors, they may be temporarily holding a bag but if they can manage their short-term emotions I have no doubt it will pay off 2-40x with enough time.

Just my opinion. This is not advice‚Ä¶ as it is merely stating the facts as I see them and why I remain happily invested and follow closely.",The Netlist (NLST) Saga: How One Company Is Taking On Big Tech Giants Like Google In A Case That Can Change History,1.0,2022-11-07 00:06:18

Friday (11/4) was a day of Epic reversal for a  lot of Tech stocks and Nasdaq. Apple $137 Strike Calls were trading for  $0.08 around 3 PM. By the time it was 3:45 PM they were trading above a  $1.

Starting with a measly $100, if you can hit 4 10X Home runs, you can reach $1M. I know this is an  insanely difficult task, but the plan is to keep watching the markets  and never putting a Buy order unless you see an epic reversal after days  of beat down like this. There are no called Strikes until you press that Buy button. It may take weeks or months to get those perfect shots but it  is not impossible.

150,1667754845,ynw6kd,1,"**How to Trade Level to Level**

This is a question I must get at least 10 times a day. So I am going to indepth do my best to explain to you guys what a Level to Level or L2L play is for me. 

The whole reason I started including more of these is that despite this being a scalpers market I realize its nearly impossible for someone to mirror a scalp. While it can be done the reward generally will never be as great as mine for the mirror. These plays are more of a set it and forget it sort of play and a play that due to the longer DTE and longer time held everyone can play them while still having a great risk to reward play. 

**Picking a DTE**

First off this is NOT a scalp this is a play that will usually take a while to develop and very well could develop overnight too. With that in mind that immediately means we need a slightly longer DTE to utilize. For SPY I prefer a 3-5dte, however, this also greatly varies on the actual way premiums and theta are hitting. When I play a Tesla or Apple L2L I prefer at least 3dte or longer. Since general stocks only expire on Fridays that means pretty much after Tuesday I will refer to the next weeks DTE. The issue especially with a stock like Tesla is that it moves like Wildfire so if you are wrong or the play does move against you then you will need to your way you will get wrecked before its ever worth it. 

You have to weigh a short enough DTE that the move nets you profits quickly but not so short that if the play takes time to develop as it usually does that you don‚Äôt end up missing out hugely. 

**Choosing the correct position size** 

This is the one tricky thing about the L2L plays. We have to chose a size big enough that the risk to reward is there and that we get a nice pay out. However, we can not immediately open such a large position size that we end up with a big loss if it goes against us. 

The way I enter my position sizes is of a normal scalp size (which is about $2000-$2500 for me). I like to open at least 50-75% immediately depending on how strongly I feel about the play. If I feel its going to be a pretty aggressive move and that im timing pretty much right before the bounce then I will open closer to 75% if not more and end up near $2000 for the trade. However, if like Friday I expect it to consolidate first possibly then I will usually start with about $1000-$1500 initially opened. This allows me to average down if I feel the play is valid and it holds my stop loss. 

But wait! DD you say averaging down a loser is just making a loser a bigger loser!? Correct! I did say that‚Ä¶ however, that applies mostly for a scalp. I NEVER add to my scalps because those are 0dte‚Ä¶ And those are pretty much hit or miss. I either immediately hit profits and close or im pretty much immediately wrong too. So averaging that down is not smart. However, this play factors in an average down on purpose and also uses clear support/ resistance levels to average down. 

**When to stop loss out**

The thing about these level to level plays that I enjoy is that they have a built in stop. So let me post an example of that from Friday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyxlirrs5dy91.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c334066f4339df0ea6f1b3621210da0c8aed6c2a

So here you can see I already KNEW that my stop loss was going to be if a candle closes below 370.6. Now you gotta be forgiving with this too. So within reason because we did have a candle close near 370.5. So if we had closed under 370 I would have closed this play. The important thing I factor into this also is that I want my stop loss to be somewhere around 20% still. That‚Äôs just how my risk to reward and win rate works. I don‚Äôt want one L2L loss to wipe out numerous L2L wins. 

**When to average down?** 

Lets take a look at a Tesla L2L I took on Friday also and this will be a great example of a time where averaging down works. Friday when tesla on the daily had appeared to be holding 210 support and forming a nice double bottom I entered a 7dte ATM Call. My take profit target was near 215 to 219.3. Looking back at the daily and weekly charts I know that Tesla for the last 2 weeks has broken through 205.6 support numerous times but everytime it has popped back up and refused to close below it. So what I did was purposefully make my stop loss closing UNDER 205.6 EOD. This gave me enough room where at the LOD I still only saw about -30% 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke1qvu9t5dy91.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2afd0346939b4b734eba1c269086788d3729de0

Okay above you can see my call out on the play. Now lets look at how it actually played out intraday. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ud60poqt5dy91.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37d77f12eb18e0ec03fda6482dfa1f8baa974a58

So with this Tesla L2L you REALLY had to trust the levels. You had to trust that even though we broke key support that we were going to see a recovery by EOD which has historically happened time and time again. This was a great Risk to reward play as this is probably one of the strongest levels tesla has. 

Now looking back I could have absolutely waited for 205.6 support test before initially entering the play, but on Friday you can see we had that massive sell off after a strong morning and we had bounced off that key 210 support are intraday and was appearing to recover. The one thing looking back that I DID misplay on this was not waiting for the candle to break back over the 5ema before entering this play. However, leaving room to average down and knowing the key levels we can be a little aggressive and sometimes snag a more reward in doing so if we recognize the risk. 

So here once EOD we broke back over that 205.6 level and closed back over the 5ema I was able to average down on my call. I did end up hitting exactly break even at one point EOD before the choppiness hit. With this support level being so strong I felt comfortable swinging this over the weekend. Knowing that we could retest 205.6 but most likely would bounce but after that EOD recovery I expect to see a bigger push up at open Monday to look for an exit. 

**How I choose the play**

The way I choose my level to level plays is based off daily price action along with current intraday price action. What I am looking for is when we find a key support area on the daily chart that the intraday 15min chart is then finding support at. 

Lets take a look at another example from Friday 11/4/22 on SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0l8hhl9u5dy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=989b59106a6c151a892065b2d55b64a1066306cd

Taking a look at Friday here is a L2L play that I made on Friday. So you can see I clearly have highlighted in purpose 370.6 as a key support. This is one of my levels established from my TA on the SPY daily chart. What I saw here is that after the massive morning sell off we bounced hard off 370.6 and continued to hold all candles closing over this level. We had about 10 candles bounce off this level total. When I saw this extremely strong support establishing around this level I knew it was time to enter a LEVEL TO LEVEL play. 

The first thing and most important thing is we have to chose a DTE. For me I chose a 5DTE. Why did I choose a 5DTE? When we first bounced and double bottomed off the 370.6 level at noon I Did expect a big bounce back up near that 374.9 resistance, however, I knew it could consolidate there first (which is exactly what ended up happening). Had I taken a 0dte play here by time EOD that move up finally happened I would have been. 

Now that I chose the correct DTE we have to set our TP target and our Stop loss target. 

Take profit will for a call play be the next resistance which in this case is 374.9. 

Stop loss target as I mentioned was a FULL candle closed below 370.6. As breaking that key support would signal a bigger downside to come on SPY. On the daily 370.6 is actually a huge level support that separates periods of price action. 

Once we enter the play do we diamond hand it or do we take profits when we can? Well this is where things get tricky. In the end PROFITS are KING.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4f2i8xru5dy91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c11ab6d8601a1e50a9822ba71a35e2b76169eb16

Here is what it looks like for me at least on a few different L2L plays from earlier Friday morning. As you can see for these I actually entered a 3dte and 5dte on SPY (I actually usually do this to show you guys the difference in pay out not so much because I wanna play it both ways) but for tesla I did enter the 0dte because in the morning that‚Äôs how strongly I felt about the play and knew it would hit quick but would let the 7dte tesla play out longer.

Usually I look for at least 10% but if I recognize that things have turned against me then I will exit for a much smaller gain. There is no reason to let a play go red‚Ä¶ 3% green is better then -20% red. 

Generally I will just add some stop limit orders as you can see and I will continue to increase that level as price moves in my direction. And if it stops me out green well it‚Äôs a win either way! Now the issue here is that many many times I stop out way before the actual L2L ever fully plays out. Which means I miss out on a HUGE win, however, if you look at the first stop limits here I was playing the 374.9 support to 378 breakout and got a nice win. I really thought we were going to see a huge green day and very well could have let those run think we see 380-385. However, had I done that on Friday I would have taken a massive loss on that sell off. 

I would say the biggest risk on these L2L plays is that we can not use a hard fast and set stop loss. If we do at say -20% like we usually do then we may stop out before key support actually holds and the play develops. However, when the key support or resistance against us breaks we have to exit and be okay accepting the loss. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img vvzvvgcv5dy91...*

Here is an example of when I actually followed my own stop loss and had I actually diamond handed it this play the very next candle would have been back to profits. However, we HAVE to be mechanical in trading. We cant be smarter then the candles or the charts. IF the play fails it fails. If it comes back to life after we close it‚Ä¶ then that‚Äôs something we can consider and something to take into play about perhaps using a looser stop loss next time but in my opinion for every play that came back from the dead there are 10 that never came back. My losers that I have held that never come back GREATLY outweigh those that come back to life.

Lets take a little more of a zoomed out look on the daily this time. What do we see? We see that we are still well within that green bear channel of 2022 and are holding right around that red dotted 50% retracement line. We have also formed over the last 2 months now a very sizeable black rising wedge that support was actually reconfirmed on today. We also held the red channel support of 370.6 extremely well today and rejected the 378 channel resistance all in one single day (which is impressive). Effectively we are stuck in this train and rising wedge until otherwise proven. 

Bull case for next week- bulls want to see a midterm election week rally and see a rally into CPI. First step is taking out that 378 resistance and establishing that as support. From there its time to take the red resistance line out from FOMC and look to retest the daily 100ema resistance around 388-390. 

Bear case for next week- with a looming CPI ahead and the FOMC pivot on the pivot this week bears will look to continue to reject 378 channel resistance and eventually break through and close under the 370.5 support and break the support of the black rising wedge. Once that is broken bears have opened the downside to re-test the 350 to 360 support area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bfkkd5a30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e512c7c006be622548dd43c6fd3a4df6d5346c99

On the weekly timeframe you can see we actually did break the rising wedge that is present from last week. However, we did come down and retest the weekly 200ema and confirmed that as support this week. With this candle body closing inside of last weeks bears and bulls both have an opportunity to break out next week and this could be the start of a bull flag if the bulls can defend 375.9 next week. 

Key support- 375.9 -&gt; 363.6 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 390.2 -&gt; 408.6

Futures has a similar rising wedge formed with the downside resistance from FOMC. Overall a really nice double bottom and bullishly engulfing candle on futes daily that should provide some upside for Monday next week. Bulls need to retake that 3805 resistance next week early and bears will look to take out 3710 support early next week. Both of these remain key pivot points for futures. 

&amp;#x200B;

Futures (SPY too really) has a overall macro falling wedge with a blue bull channel that has a blue/ red rising wedge inside of it‚Ä¶ yay TA! Overall this was a double top on the weekly at 3910, however, this could easily form into a 3775 double bottom come Sunday night at open and easily lead to an upside push next week. With the weekly 200ema being held once again we should look at upside not downside.

Apple had one of the most interesting intradays I have seen on a non major catalysts day in a long time. Apple went all the day down to the October CPI LOD within one penny and someone still managed to rally back and close over 138.2. I actually REALLY would have liked to take apple calls with this closure back over key 138.2 support but it was EOD and too late plus I already had TESLA calls im swinging and SPY I opened instead. 

Apple will look to attempt to gap fill that 145 gap for the bulls and bears are going to attempt to close under 138.2 and put in a new 52 week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9ifx6bc30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb54a497a1a26685abc6a65cae03b3bf8c0f2b6

The weekly show just how strong this 138.2 support is for Apple and why I was so ready to pull the trigger on calls but was too slow. You can also see that Apple did close back under its weekly 100ema and put In its biggest red week since March 2020 during the COVID crash. 

Key support ‚Äì 138.2 -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 129.1

Tesla as I had mentioned continues to range in that 205.6 to 234 red channel. I had played some overnight calls on tesla for a huge 47.8% win at open on a 7dte and thankfully closed at open because wow did it get absolutely smacked down. Tesla put in a $20.72 drop from HOD to LOD which was 156% of its average 10day range. A pretty impressive range for Tesla that‚Äôs for sure. The biggest thing we have forming here on Tesla is that huge blue/ black diamond and we bounced hard one again off the 205.6 support range. I will be looking for an upside move next week on Tesla and remain bullish especially as long as we continue to hold 205.6 support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iztfevdd30y91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3775a029fe4ebe54c829bb59a9c5508c917f74b1

AS you can see on Tesla weekly chart we are still within that downward bear channel and did reject an attempt to breakout over the weekly 8ema. There is also a breakout triangle forming with key level of 224.2 and 207.8 for next week. 

Key supports- 204.4 -&gt; 192.1

Key resistance- 228.3 -&gt; 245

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/157xkwhe30y91.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad41f6767f0490a95c28e16704e60fc6bbd4cee0

We finally saw some volatility with the VIX today with a pretty large rebound spike when we had that huge 1115am dump. However, the vix remains in the downward channel and realistically until we see that resistance broken and see a major major bearish catalyst (cough CPI cough) I wouldn‚Äôt be shorting just yet. You COULD start adding slow longer DTE puts like 30-60 dte but I feel you are still early and are just wasting money. WE are also approaching that key 23.6 VIX support area and funny enough before the September CPI we actually were right at the 23.6 support area too. Perhaps we see a pretty bullish three days next week on the markets much like September leading into CPI and then CPI starts the next leg down headed into December. 

Overall I lean for a bullish Monday at least with a possible choppy Tuesday/ Wednesday as markets prepare for CPI but there is a very good chance we could see a pretty impressive green week next week and end up all the back up near 390 before CPI hits. The higher we are the bigger drop I believe CPI could potentially bring for us. 

Daily log- 

This was another amazing week for me. The week really did suck Monday and Tuesday and then after taking that bigger L on Wednesday I was able to recover today and end up finishing the week off going 11 for 11 today with 4 for 4 on scalps and 7 for 7 on level to level plays. Note- a lot of people are inquiring more about my level to level plays so this is something I will once again try to cover and I will make a post this weekend about it I hope.

Interestingly enough‚Ä¶ this is now the 2nd week in a row where my level to level plays have netted a greater profit then my actual scalps. This is something I will continue to monitor as time goes forward and I will continue to adjust as time goes on. This week was also extremely tough to scalp as Monday and Tuesday were very untradeable and then Wednesday with the IV spiking was tougher to trade too for big gains. However, with this being the 2nd week in a row with these results I will continue to monitor and see going forward if this trend holds. But for anyone following me who struggles to get in on the scalps while obviously the win rate is no perfect on the L2L plays and never will be with the built in price target stop loss and take profit target (tho I regrettably always take profits early) the profits should greatly outweigh the losses. Definitely something to keep in mind going forward for me. 

Youtube will be up later!

I‚Äôm new to wsb, I discussed my stocks more with friends but they all gave up on trading lol. I made big profits in the last years with Tesla and other tech stuff (about 500%). I was basically a buy and hold investor but started with options some months ago to leverage my portfolio. It did well but I‚Äôm less optimistic now. I think the next years will be though and shorting the Nasdaq 100 is still a good move now. But I‚Äôll still hold Tesla and Apple. Maybe some other large caps too - It‚Äôs hard to let them go after all those years of profits.

The only thing I‚Äôm really optimistic right now is Porsche. It startet only about one month ago and the Porsche family is happily buying back as much stocks as possible. They set a very low price on the stock to buy it back very cheap. I think they secretly want to buy back everything to own it again like in the early 2000s. I‚Äôm not sure if they are genius or crazy‚Ä¶ Anyway I also calculated a target price of 154‚Ç¨ per share in the short term and expect it much higher if they really want to buy it back. The fundamentals and future are amazing and I bought lots of lots of calls. Maybe some of you have also looked at P911 and wants to discuss it.

* Apple's market value is now higher than that of Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined.
* The iPhone maker's worth stands at $2.307 trillion, while its tech peers add up to $2.306 trillion.
* Tech stocks have suffered after posting poor quarterly earnings, but Apple dodged a wipeout.

Apple is now worth more than fellow tech giants Alphabet, Amazon and Meta combined, after it ended trading Wednesday with a market value of $2.307 trillion.

At the same time, the market caps of its three tech giant peers added up to $2.306 trillion at the close of trading Wednesday. Google parent Alphabet's market cap stood at $1.126 trillion, Amazon's at $939.78 billion and Facebook parent Meta's at $240.07 billion, Yahoo Finance data showed.

Overall, Big Tech stocks suffered a brutal selloff last week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings. But Apple's stock has outperformed its peers after it beat Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts for its fourth quarter.

The iPhone maker's shares soared 8% in the wake of its results. After their earnings reports, Meta plunged more than 20%, Amazon fell about 10%, while Alphabet saw a single-digit decline.

Alphabet, Amazon and Meta's lackluster earnings signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging. The poorly-received results have helped wipe billions off their market values as their shares fell, and pushed Amazon out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.

Over the past five sessions, Apple's stock has risen 0.16%, while Alphabet has fallen 5.7%, Amazon is down 17.0% and Meta has lost 7.6% over that period.

Despite Apple's achievement, its market cap has fallen back from its $2.193 trillion value at the end of 2021. A series of headwinds ‚Äî high inflation, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the Ukraine war among them ‚Äî have meant tech stocks have struggled in 2022 as investors lost appetite for higher risk assets.

After a pretty exciting pre market with how red we opened (bless up for my over night puts) we after the first 45 minutes of the day held the same about $3 range all day long. With a love volume red day it seems there is a lot of sidelines money right now and we could end up seeing buyers step back in. I am cautiously optimistic for tomorrow bull wise though.

The biggest thing that I mentioned bear wise that happened yesterday was that we broke through key 378 support (green channel). I had mentioned that 370.5 was another big area. I highlighted it here to make it a little more clear. You can see that there is a clear resistance/ support line right there. With SPY breaking through and then holding over it all day and closing over it today I am actually looking for an upside resistance test. 

SPY has put in 4 red days in a row now so it could be expected we get a green day. The other oddity to say the least is that SPY closed down -1.02% and the VIX also closed down -2.28%. Usually I would say that doesn‚Äôt happen but in 2022 and lately its happening more and more. Despite everything the JPOW said yesterday the fear isn‚Äôt rising in the markets. This is either  sign by the VIX that we should continue to be bullish and expect upside or this is a really ‚Äúcheap‚Äù opportunity to buy some longer DTE puts. 

Bulls will want to defend 370.5 tomorrow again and more or less leave it in the dust and completely gap fill 374.76 tomorrow. From there they need to retest the 378 resistance line and attempt to break back into that zone. 

Bears will want to finally take out 370.5 and close below it with hopes of testing 365 to 359.9 tomorrow and into next week. This is the first time we have had a full candle close below the daily 8ema since before CPI. 

Key support- 370.5 -&gt; 365 -&gt; 359.9

Key resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 378

Looking at futures we nicely held resistance at 3770 and were not quite able to break through support at 3705. Bulls will look to retake 3770 and possibly key 3805 tomorrow. 

Bears will look to continue the sell off and seek out 3705 and most importantly 3675 support.

Apple looked incredibly heavy compared to the rest of the market and actually was the worst top 10 ticker of the day just barely beating out Google. Interestingly enough Apple is only $3 away from its after hours low of 136 on earnings day. 

Now that Apple is back at the 138.2 support area this is where we can look for it to bounce if it is going to bounce. However, something to keep in mind is that unlike tesla and other stocks Apple has NOT put in its 2nd 52week low‚Ä¶ this very well could be its attempt at doing so. 

We have a nice black downward channel inside of a falling wedge that also have a falling wedge inside of the black channel‚Ä¶ lol yes I know right?

Tesla continues to be all over the place. We did see it break through that ‚Äúmid‚Äù point of 215 today however it was able to find support nicely at 210. However, it did break through the 2 day drop resistance line it was not able to break through and take out the daily 8ema this morning and had a pretty strong rejection there. I will be looking to see if Tesla finds support here with this doji on a downrend which can lead to an upside recovery or if it will indeed retest 205.6 support tomorrow.

The VIX just absolutely continues to unwind here and doesn‚Äôt seem to be phased by anything at all anymore. What will cause the VIX to spike and revery back to the 28-30+ range? Honestly im not sure at this point. The really only big bear event ahead is CPI next Thursday but besides that we have nothing till December. December actually is doing to be a Doozy with CPI on a Tuesday immediately followed the next day by FOMC. 

This CPI still does not have a consensus out‚Ä¶ which gives me the same type of vibes from last September CPI which could result in a bigger sell off again. I wouldnt be surprised to see a short rally tomorrow till next week. Markets are looking for that ‚Äúoh wow yeah lets sell‚Äù reason again and I don‚Äôt forsee one till CPI. CPI most likely will miss and that‚Äôs where it gets complicated. On one hand we know jpow said he isn‚Äôt ready to slow or pause‚Ä¶ he said inflation aint fixed‚Ä¶ so another bad CPI maybe he rockets a 100bps at us? Definitely another 75bps at us‚Ä¶ how will markets react? Will we react like September or will we react like October.

&amp;#x200B;

All apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.

Yes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling

&amp;#x200B;

Apple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter and I personally think this can only be explained by ""People paying for apple products again and again."" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.

It's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. They don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still growing. A LOT

The interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. 

The other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didn‚Äôt spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. 

What does that mean ? well im not quite sure but those months of FOMC were more bullish.

We also have quite a few articles released today saying that Biden supports a pivot of the fed (this was later slightly walked back though). 

My initial thoughts on what to expect tomorrow is that JPOW drops a 75bps (I would be SHOCKED to see a 50bps) but then he should hint at a ‚Äúwe will remain data dependent but there is a case to slow hikes if we continue to see optimism and to fully evaluate the effects of rate hikes.‚Äù

This TA is going to be pretty brief as markets gonna move however the algos want it to with FOMC. 

But overall we did attempt to breakout over 390.1 resistance of the green channel. With that pretty stout rejection we are not finding support which we did find almost all day at 385. This could if we get a green day tomorrow also be seen as a nice daily 8ema/ 50ema support test. In addition I am seeing that the 8ema is crossing back over the 50ema (bullishly) for the first time in two months. 

The rejection at 390.1 also was a rejection of the daily 100ema which im not super surprised by as this level is usually a bigger fight. Markets will need the push from good FOMC news tomorrow to break through these key levels and breakout until CPI. 

Key support- 380.1 -&gt; 377.8 -&gt; 374.1

Looking at futures we have actually had this pattern play out just last week where we found support and managed to push up for an extreme green day. 

With a rejection of that 200ema today and that 3925 level that will remain key resistance and we will look for that level to be closed over tomorrow to continue to be bullish.

Apple has nearly retraced all the way back to where it was Friday before that massive rip on earnings. I wish I woulda been smart enough to short it Friday at market close. Apple was able to back test and hold the daily 8/50ema support lines today, however fell and closed under the 100/200ema.

Tesla actually had a pretty nice pop today and broke through (but failed to close over) a key level. I was mentioning as you can see that 205 to 230 red channel on tesla. With this break through I am actually looking at an upside move on tesla (despite FOMC). 

This is its first time its broken through key 230 resistance since October 7th. We still have not closed over 230 though but as long as tesla holds over its daily 8ema and continues to hold this red bull channel I will remain bullish on it.

I think that anything super hawkish for the FOMC tomorrow especially if he says 75bps in December the VIX is going to spike like no other and we could very well end up with a huge red day. However, I remain bullish and I think JPOW wont say anything to tip the markets down tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall today was yet again another untradeable day after the first big move. Was able to get some nice scalps in today. And with an average down on my SPY and Tesla puts this morning at open I was able to close the SPY level to level puts for green and close the Tesla level to level puts for a smaller loss (they were very red at open). I don‚Äôt like DCAing to win a play like that but I didn‚Äôt expect that massive pre-market and with SPY holding under and beginning to dump off the key 390.1 resistance at open I felt confident in the DCA.

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today‚Ä¶ as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons.

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear ‚Äúbreakout/ down‚Äù levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Not much of a surprise after that‚Äôs unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema.

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support.

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day‚Ä¶ one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside‚Ä¶ only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn‚Äôt for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that‚Äôs something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal‚Ä¶ today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness.

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn‚Äôt so much about getting random massive winners‚Ä¶ though I had some nice wins in there too‚Ä¶ it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn‚Äôt mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It‚Äôs a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

Launched in 2016, IIP is the first publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange to provide real estate capital to the regulated cannabis industry. The company's sale-leaseback program includes cultivation, processing and retail properties with carefully chosen tenants that are licensed operators under long-term, triple-net leases.

Over the last five years, IIP's stock has outperformed some of the most popular stocks in the world, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). That's not all, the company has been paying consecutive quarterly dividends to its common stockholders since the second quarter of 2017.

The San Diego, California-headquartered marijuana REIT is focused on well-capitalized and state-licensed cannabis businesses across all product types, targeting deals in the amounts of $5 million to $30+ million. Its standard lease terms last from 10 to 20 years, with initial base rents of 10% to 16% on total investment.

(OTCQX: CURLF), Trulieve Cannabis (OTCQX: TCNNF), PharmaCann, Cresco Labs (OTCQX: CRLBF), Columbia Care (OTCQX: CCHWF), Green Thumb Industries (OTCQX: GTBIF), Goodness Growth Holdings (OTCQX: GDNSF), 4Front Ventures (OTCQX: FFNTF), Holistic Industries, Ayr Wellness (OTCQX: AYRWF), Parallel, and Ascend Wellness Holdings (OTCQX: AAWH).

As of September 1, 2022, IIP owns 111 properties comprising an aggregate of around 8.7 million rentable square feet (including approximately 2.1 million rentable square feet under development or redevelopment) in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

In its latest earnings report, the company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.9 million for the second quarter of 2022, or $1.42 per diluted share, and AFFO of approximately $60.1 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. It also paid a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per common share on July 15, 2022, to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2022, representing a 25% increase over the prior year's second quarter 2021 dividend, equal to an annualized dividend of $7.00 per share.

how is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.

The share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. 

OCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?

Lets flash back to last Friday‚Ä¶ The beginning of of the week had a nice green two days followed by a doji Wednesday and a hammer candle on Thursday. This hammer candle showed downside potential and after hours did too. Then Friday came and out of no where ripped a 2.45% green day‚Ä¶ Flash forward to this week its nearly an identical movement. I mean 100% identical. Scary at best. 

Today I am not too proud to admit I misplayed 100% and I unknowingly was far to bearish and bet against the markets. The worst part is‚Ä¶ I even called this weekly rally last week in my weekly TA.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a3a56ccw7mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f85daeb5ea4b1cf9f4dac4f908e24f3738ffc38

Guess I should trust myself a little more huh? I definitely got blinded by the big tech earning misses, GDP coming in hot af, PCE/ PMI, job claims, etc etc etc. all of that was bearish af for the week. But what happened? Market didn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ why? Because the markets still believe JPOW is going to say on Wednesday at 230pm for FOMC (stay tuned this weekend I will release the FOMC trading plan to the server) that ‚Äúwe have inflation under control or we don‚Äôt wanna over shoot on rate hikes so we will look to slow down our hikes in December.‚Äù

This is why we are rallying in my opinion. 

So where does this leave us next week‚Ä¶ well this is the scenarios I forsee. 

Monday and Tuesday I have pinned for a bullish because we really don‚Äôt have anything on the books negative wise. I don‚Äôt forsee anything economic or macro wise to really bring us down and its pretty clear by this weeks movements and recovery that bulls are in control and the markets is not going to sell off (I misplayed that today). 

Wednesday is FOMC day‚Ä¶ I expect a green day. Now the question will be does JPOW rightfully say ‚Äúwe have not controlled inflation and while we do not want to overshoot rate hikes we need to slow inflation first‚Äù if he says this then we should look for a dump into CPI. However, if he says ‚ÄúI believe inflation is tamed and we will see the effects of that on the next CPI and going forward and that should allow us to slow our rate hikes‚Ä¶ slow not pause‚Ä¶‚Äù we are going to rally. 

From there I honestly don‚Äôt forsee CPI coming in as a beat at all.. it actually is going to probably be a huge miss‚Ä¶ if you remember back in August when CPI came in hot they held off on releasing the consensus (just like now) until we got very close to CPI‚Ä¶ I have a feeling after or the day of FOMC we will see the consensus finally released. Which will allow me to accurately predict next CPI‚Ä¶   
 

Regardless of whether we rally or dump after FOMC I expect us to get a bad CPI reading and I will be looking for a repeat of August. What I think is happening is a tactful unwinding of the VIX prior to FOMC and CPI to avoid the crash once again. It seems like this is the general strategy that has happened time and time again. We get these rallies through bad news, and every dip is a buying opportunity where the technical make zero sense (such as this morning where VOLD was extreme bearish and nearly extreme bearish however we saw markets continue to rip). 

In short im bullish till Wednesday then we will take it from there‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

In short SPY has maintained this red bull channel for 2 weeks now and until I see this bull channel broken I will remain bullish. I am seeing today we made a really nice double bottom off 379.8 which also was a daily 8ema support test and hold (this is the big play I over looked today with my bearish bias). In addition we put in a 2 day (almost 3) bullish engulfing daily candle. With maintaining and holding within this green channel and failing to retrace through it I am seeing that a 390.1 resistance test will be coming on Monday. The question is do we level up and push for the 400s before FOMC or do we reject that 390 level Monday and actually spend some time consolidating before FOMC. 

Fun note- this week is now the only the 2nd time this year that markets have put in a green week the week before FOMC the other time was July. 

If and when we break through 390 then I will be looking as the 50% retracement line of the bear channel and start eyeing 405.1 as next level resistance. I am not quite convinced that we will have the steam to get there but I do think we could take 395-400 before FOMC or on FOMC day (if jpow is bullish). 

However, if Monday we reject 390.1 channel resistance I would look for this red bull channel support to be tested and see if that 380 support holds. The one thing to note is that this is the first time a candle has closed over 388.6 since September 22nd.

Funny enough about this weekly candle is that this candle last night was showing a 100% different story. However, todays candle is our 2nd green week in a row and our first back to back green weeks since August. With this candle I look for continuation, however, we did fall just short of breaking through the weekly 20ema. We will need to take that level out then we can start looking at that next major level resistance of 408.9. 

If we double top of the weekly 20ema we could see a retracement back to that 375.6 weekly level. 

Key support- 385.2 -&gt; 375.6 -&gt; 363.7

Key resistance- 390 -&gt; 399.8 -&gt; 409.9

Futures put in a massive green day today and dead ended right at that 3925 level which just so happens to be its daily 100ema. On the bullish side of things you can see we held the daily 8ema as support today, reconfirmed 3800 as support and broke through the bear channel from August. There is no longer (besides the 2022 bear channel resistance) downward resistance to watch for. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fscdh1z28mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e808dce0070bfd9ff8ae8db162339380956d5f3

Futures actually was able to close over the weekly 20ema. However, as you can see it fell just short of breaking through the orange channel level resistance of 3925. Next week we will look for futures to turn 3925 into support which should open up an opportunity for futes to test next level resistance around 4085. 

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 4005 -&gt; 4085

Apple put in one hell of an impressive day today making a total intraday movement of $9.68 which was 179% of its 10day average range. It also put in 175% of its 30day average volume today. People poured into Apple today. I think people found their ‚Äúsafe haven.‚Äù

Apple actually broke through its bull channels resistance and topped out right at 157.5 resistance today. With that being where apple hit and retraced we will look for that as key resistance to break over next week. 

This is the first time Apple has closed over the 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema since September 12th. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w10vo4448mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bedfeababdc8a92d237b080c4c7d3c42cb2bb432

Apple weekly played perfectly off the levels‚Ä¶ for those who say TA don‚Äôt work or that you cant TA stuff when its parabolic‚Ä¶ today even on a ridiculously big move Apple still respected levels. These chart levels were untouched and it closed right under that key 157.5 weekly level. 

With apple bounced off that red support line, holding 147.2 as support and closing over all the EMAs we should naturally look for some upside next week. 

Key support- 150.6 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 141.2

Key resistance- 155.8 -&gt; 161.2

My love and hate relationship with Tesla is unmatched by anything else. Tesla provided me with 3 huge wins 3 days in a row, however, today I became too bearish and burnt myself playing some level to level plays. Now that I am being more objective I actually see a pretty bullish case for tesla next week. 

We came back down and tested the daily 8ema and managed to close back over that. However, we did fall just short of 230 resistance and the daily 20ema resistance. Tesla looked like it had no sense of direction today and that could have possibly been related to the twitter deal being completed today. 

With this hanging man candle on the daily I am looking for a repeat of 10/24/22 and will look to see a bigger push up on Tesla Monday/ next week. We are right at key resistance for the blue bear channel which lies at 228 for Monday. 

There is a case to be made as I mentioned earlier this week that tesla is establishing a consolidation channel from 205 to 230 and honestly until we close over 230 we haven‚Äôt officially broken that trend yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xko3nh458mw91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f20046ac91fcc7fe9e9798bbbaff7caa08d2f411

Tesla still has a daily and weekly gap at 262.47 to fill. I don‚Äôt forsee that filling next week but with a bullish enough sentiment and bullish enough FOMC its not out of the realm of possibilities. Bulls are not trading back over the weekly 50% bear channel retracement mark and will look to turn 2330 turn into support next week. 

Support -204.5 -&gt; 191.7

Resistance- 245 -&gt; 254.7

As I had mentioned I do believe we are seeing the VIX being unwound before FOMC and next CPI. Its generally bad juju to have it over 30 before such events happen. With us clearly trading under the key 28.4 and now under 27 I will look for a the VIX to be near 23.6 to 24.7 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

10% challenge- 

Overall despite finishing green today (bless up tesla) today was not a great day for me. I was too biased bearish and I couldn‚Äôt get a read on the technical today. VOLD (difference of buy/ sell on NYSE) is one of my biggest indicators and biggest check boxes for entering a trade. Today until about 1145am VOLD was not supporting any sort of rallying. IT actually was showing that a huge sell off should have occurred. This also put me overly bearish, however, the charge was led by SPY and tech today and by mid day NYSE jumped on board finally. From there I still took every rejection (consolidation) at key levels as a short opportunity and ended up missing out on some good bull plays. 

Cant win them all and no ones perfect but I look forward to a good weekend to reset my head and trade better next week. This has been a pretty tough 3 days to trade in my opinion. Monday and Tuesday were great though thankfully. 

My Apple put was toasted at open but took a nice win on that Amazon earnings play at open to recoup most of the loss‚Ä¶ apparently I shoulda gone even more OTM as one of the 80s puts on Amazon paid 1k%+ at open.

I have gotten a lot of questions of ‚Äúhow did you go from 6 out of 8 weeks being red to 8 green weeks in a row? ‚ÄúHow is it even possible to go from losing that much to winning like this now?‚Äù 

The answer sadly was right in front of me the whole time‚Ä¶ risk management. I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. 

Lets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. 

Note- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. 

Now what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn‚Äôt recover. 

For the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate‚Ä¶ but completely different result‚Ä¶ So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses‚Ä¶ and not increased my win rate or anything else‚Ä¶ I would have been profitable on every single week.). 

So when people ask me ‚Äúwhat did you change?‚Äù ‚Äúits impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!‚Äù ‚Äúits impossible for someone to recover like that!‚Äù

I say no its not‚Ä¶ I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhere was your stop loss?‚Äù   
 

Risk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. 

There is a rule called the 10/20 rules‚Ä¶ the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover.

206,1666983564,yfxijy,1,"I see some real shit opinions all over Reddit on META, as this place has somehow become a cynical cesspool of anti-intellectual teenagers that think they know better. 

Listen to me instead. An elder millennial that gets triggered by misinformation all day long and also thinks I know better. (sometimes it's even true) Also, may or may not be regarded. You tell me. 

Here's what I see:

\&gt;""it looks worse than roblox / vr chat"" 

\&gt;""Facebook is dying""

\&gt;""bring back myspace""

First of all, shut the fuck up. Just stop. Please. It hurts my head. If it was true, that would be fine. But like I said I my autism gets triggered by dumbness. 

WHY has Facebook/META thrown nearly 100 billion at this? (with a revenue of 27 billion per quarter, they have the money)

Facebook is the ONLY multi-modal social media company in the USA. It has a marketplace, local community groups, videos (50% of all facebook traffic is watching videos) not to mention Insta, whatsapp. You can do almost anything on it. Run a business. Chat with your mom. See what your friends are doing. Rent a boat. Harass women with pics of your extremely small penis. Whatever you want! (don't do the last one bro. Just don't.)

So WHY? 

It's a hardware platform, that you cannot access on a normal PC. Only on a META VR headset (potentially) 

You think the graphics look bad? That's like blaming youtube for 480p video. Don't blame youtube. Blame the creator for having a shitty camera. Metaverse is the platform. Not the video. It's a new platform that has tools to do whatever you want. AR or VR both in one.

Now just imagine this, if you can. Tell your wife to hop off her boyfriend's dick, pull both of them over, and try to imagine with me. 

Your favorite youtube/twitch livestreamer? Don't watch them anymore. VR with them. Walk in their room as they talk to you. Sit at their desk. You're not behind a screen anymore. You're in the room. Even a prerecorded youtube video can work this way. Or do it live.

You want to see that Ye redemption concert tour but the tickets are $5,000? Attend in VR. Walk around, live. The performer doesn't need a headset. Just you. Interact with other VR people at the concert (or not). See their facial expressions. Dance with them. Switch your headset over to AR, go to the fridge, get a drink, check your texts, reply to an email, and then head back into the concert. All using the headset. Buy merch at the shop, which has an AR eshop overlay. Easy. This can be done with 3d camera arrays. Even a basic iphone can LIDAR scan a bedroom in 5 minutes. Apple ahead of the game as always. A highly accurate (to the 1/16"" accuracy) venue model can be recreated in a single day using current technology, like the Leica BLK360 scanner. That's your metaverse. It's whatever you want. 

You can't attend your best friends wedding? Attend in VR metaverse platform. The normal attendees will just see you on a screen (or not at all), they don't need headsets. But you can walk around, see the moment, while not being too invasive. To them, you're just on an ipad somewhere. Maybe there's a few 360 cameras around. Some LIDAR scanners to record the venue (or the venue provides this). You're not intrusive, but you can experience it. 

Want to buy a puppy on FB marketplace? See it in VR. Live. Confirm it's not a scam. Send the money through Facebook even, with buyer protection.

Onlyfans - see your favorite porn model from every angle. Walk around. Jack off in the privacy of your home. Squirt some e-jizz all over his/her face. or not. I'm not the boss of you.

The possibilities here are endless. This hasn't even mentioned the work from home benefits yet. This is still 5-10 years down the road. But it is coming. Reality and the digital world WILL mix together more and more over time. Unless the apocalypse gets us first ofc. And META has a huge head start in technology hardware and software tools (not software environment))

So. That's why you're all dumb for comparing it to VR chat. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

That they haven‚Äôt innovated since Jobs.

I still think the stock is a great buy and they will continue to dominate.

Anyone who compares Apple to Nokia or Blackberry are foolish. 

It was extremely simple to go from Blackberry to Apple. It‚Äôs not easy for someone to exit Apple‚Äôs ecosystem.

Apple has a ‚Äúwalled garden‚Äù approach to their ecosystem. Easy and fun to enter ‚Ä¶ hard and impractical to exit.

Blackberry and Nokia didn‚Äôt have the same reasons to hook people onto their phones and platform for life. 

They made only phones. Apple surrounds your life with as many products as possible all seemingly working with each other.

If you want to switch it‚Äôd be time consuming and annoying. 

You‚Äôd have to figure out how to take all your years of photos from one device to another.

It‚Äôs got over ten years of my health info.
Tons of apps I‚Äôve paid for and use daily that I‚Äôd have to rebuy and resetup on a new platform. Some of those apps don‚Äôt have a real alternative I like on android.

If I bought movies or tv shows on iTunes I‚Äôd lose access to them on any new platform. Or I have Apple services like Apple Card and Apple Wallet that wouldn‚Äôt transfer. 

I‚Äôve got airpods that work solely with my apple products. Not to mention my Mac, Apple TV, Watch and iPad. They all work together. It‚Äôd be huge investment switching. Who can afford it.

No other platform is as seamlessly integrated and ‚Äúwalled off‚Äù. It was a risky idea for a
Apple to attempt it. Probably why no one else had tried it. After all it in some ways prevents people from adopting your product when you don‚Äôt play nice with other platforms. But, now that they pulled it off it‚Äôs perfect.

Is it possible for me to change? ‚Ä¶ sure but it‚Äôd be a pain (time wise) and costlier than just upgrading my iPhone.

If a revolutionary product comes out‚Ä¶ iPhone users are patient enough for Apple to come out with their on spin on it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened so far. Android gets a great new feature and sometimes it takes awhile but iPhone gets something similar.

People have sunken too much investment in terms of time(learning the ins and outs of it) and money into Apple products and services. They probably don‚Äôt want to start from scratch in a different ecosystem.

Apple has been milking that for years.

There‚Äôs always the chance I guess that some company tries to automate the process of switching by giving out free products and services‚Ä¶ automating everything in terms of switching. Giving a customer something amazing to switch.

But, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs feasible. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have tried and failed to crack the nut of competing with the iPhone. It‚Äôd be way too costly.

If anyone could‚Ä¶ maybe Tesla. But, no one is displacing Apple like they did to Blackberry.

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Friday smashed expectations as soaring energy prices fuelled a record-breaking quarterly profit, nearly matching that of tech giant Apple.

Its $19.66 billion third-quarter net profit far exceeded recently raised Wall Street forecasts as sky-rocketing natural gas and high oil prices put its earnings within reach of Apple's $20.7 billion net for the same period.

As recently as 2013, Exxon ranked as the largest publicly traded U.S. company by market value - a position now held by Apple.

Oil company profits have soared this year as rising demand and an under-supplied energy market collided with Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. U.S. exports of gas and oil to Europe have jumped and promise to set all-time profit records for the industry.

The top U.S. oil producer reported a per share profit of $4.68, exceeding Wall Street's $3.89 consensus view, on a huge jump in natural gas earnings, continued high oil prices and strong fuel sales.

Exxon, which led record gains by the five producers known as oil majors in the prior quarter, pulled far ahead of peers Shell and TotalEnergies with third-quarter profits almost twice as big. Its gains were aided by its highly criticized decision to double down on fossil fuels as European competitors shifted to renewables.

""Our investments over the past five years, including through the lows of the pandemic, are really driving our results today,"" Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells told Reuters.

Exxon banked $43 billion in the first nine months of this year, 19% more than in the same period of 2008, when oil prices traded at a record level of $140 per barrel.

The company spent $5.73 billion on new oil and gas projects last quarter, up 24% from a year ago, and remains on track to hit an investment target of $21 billion to $24 billion this year, she said.

Rising profits have renewed calls by U.S. President Joe Biden for companies to invest the windfall profits from this year's energy price runup in production rather than buy back their own shares.

Exxon will maintain its $30 billion share buyback program through 2023 while increasing dividends, Mikells said. On Friday, it declared a fourth-quarter per share dividend of 91 cents, up 3 cents, and will pay $15 billion to shareholders this year.

Investors this week pushed up Exxon shares to a record intraday high of $109.58 as oil prices traded above $96 per barrel.

In the third quarter, U.S. natural gas prices averaged $7.95 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up 10% from the second quarter. Brent prices eased to $98 per barrel in the same period, from an average of $109 between April and June.

Exxon said its oil and gas production from the Permian Basin is near 560,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), a record. That is up 11% or 50,000 barrels per day from a year ago.

Results were helped by an almost 100,000 boed increase over the previous quarter in Guyana, where Exxon leads a consortium responsible for all output in the South American nation.

But output was hit by its withdrawal from Russia, where it abandoned more than $4 billion in assets and a 220,000 boed project following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Exxon said its assets were expropriated.

As a result, the company reduced its production forecast for the year by about 100,000 barrels per day.

""We are going to end up at about 3.7 million barrels a day for the full year,"" Mikells said, down from a 3.8 million goal set in February.",Exxon's record-smashing Q3 profit nearly matches Apple's,1.0,2022-10-28 12:48:15

Highlighted this yesterday on futures but im highlighting it today on SPY to make it even more clear. The blue arrows show what looks like a possible top on SPY which should lead to a sell off. I will be looking for an interaction with SPY at 378 support (now resistance after hours). This is the key level that separates the green and grey channels. A breakdown under this support and back into the green channel would signal to me a retest of 360s is coming before we reach 390 resistance. 

This will be the key pivot level to watch tomorrow. If we reject there in the morning or close back below that support of 378 (at this point we do have a gap to fill) then I will be looking for a further sell off next week leading into FOMC and with FOMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will touch on this more tomorrow in the weekly TA but overall SPY, Futures and Apple weekly charts are setting up for a massive failed breakout gravestone doji which should lead to a pretty nice sell off next week. The one caveat with this is that FOMC is next week and that can be a wild card for sure. If it wasn‚Äôt for FOMC id play puts for sure but I will sit cash most likely unless something looks really good. 

Key support- 378.8 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3 -&gt; 370.5

Key resistance- 380 -&gt; 383.1

If you read last nights TA I said that futes most likely would go up and touch 3870 before it rejected just like happened back first week of October. That would then lead to a sell off and we would see a further sell off intraday. Well with this drop after hours its setting up perfectly to see the next leg down leading into FOMC next week. 

With that 3870 rejection and now sitting back under key 3805 support I would look for the 3600s before I look for 3900 again. 

Key support -3770 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3675

Key resistance- 3805 -&gt; 3840

Well there it is‚Ä¶ Apple missed on pretty much everything but china rev lol. So that‚Äôs not very good.. currently only down 4% after hours though. The golden boy lives! The call will be interesting for sure especially since they never give guidance anyways.

To be honest though earnings is a whole none issue for me. Apple today broke through key red bull channel support. This is the same channel that SPY and Futures are holding so far. I will look regardless of what happens for further downside next week. This could be the fuel that markets need to see Apple retest its 52week low finally. If and when that happens I will believe that the temporary bottom is in. 

Key support- 144.7 -&gt; 142.8 -&gt; 141.1

Key resistance- 148

And then there was tesla! So this is one that I am actually most excited about tomorrow at open. I think Tesla is poised for a really nice sell off tomorrow and next week. Tesla went on pretty much a 4 day bounce rally this week and established a super impressive rising wedge and bull channel. However, we say today that we broke out at open touching and rejecting key 234 resistance and then it dumped from there. If you caught that move it was one heck of nice win (granted not as nice as the call win yesterday). With this rising wedge broken I am looking to short tesla at open tomorrow most likely. I think if market remains are red as it is right now and Apple drops tomorrow and the rest of tech including SPY finally then we will see Tesla test that bull channel support. 

Tesla has established a really nice 230 to 205 consolidation channel. I am using the 230 area as a nice opportunity for puts and the 205 area for a nice opportunity for calls. 

Support- 219.2 -&gt; 215.6

Resistance- 225 -&gt; 230 -&gt; 234

Besides the VIX being detached from reality the one thing I am looking at is that we bounced off that previous support of 27 today and closed with a dragonfly doji. This should result in a nice retracement tomorrow which should also result in a nice dump of SPY tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

**Character**: With all that being said, he is kind of an annoying human. If he wasn't rich, wasn't good at engineering, wasn't changing the world, no one would like him personally. Mother of his children and x wife is all the character reference you need. 

**Interest Rates:** With the interest rate environment drastically different, and the TSLA bros starting to get underwater, his magic touch is wearing off. Just look at the TSLA chart YTD and try to feel positive about that. You can't. 

**Comps**: Kanye was the greatest rapper of all time. Trump was the greatest president of all time (not saying I agree, but some do). Elon is the greatest engineer of all time. No one really cares about their accomplishments if they don't comply with the social fabric of the new woke left America. It really doesn't matter about facts, only about feels. Not sure Elon gives people the good vibes he used to. Trump, Kanye, Elon are the three free speech musketeers - two out of these three are officially cancelled already. 

**Annoying**: Sink into twitter is a bitch move. It mocks the establishment, mocks the left. He threatens to fire 75% of the staff - even if they deserve it, this is a very ""non left"" thing to do. 

**Women**: He keeps impregnating women and then leaving them. Lefties don't like that. He impregnates his employees as well. I am sure there are some settlements out there he has made, or an abortion he paid for, just a matter of time until someone attacks him. 

**Anti-Vax Narative:** He is anti vax in some regard. He believes in science for sure, but isn't afraid to criticize WHO, Fauci, Biden, The Government, Big Pharma or other players on the left. 

**Capitalism is Bad Now:** He is anti worker, pro capitalist. Expects people to sleep in the factory, return to work, do his bidding or be unemployed. 

**Big Tech is Bad Now:** Both left and right hate ‚Äúbig tech‚Äù - this is one of the only things that politicians agree on. Social media is bad, consumer privacy should be protected, tech companies shouldn't have more power than politicians. 

**Disrespects the Government:** He smokes weed on Joe Rohan with privileged defense contracts. This is just another disrespectful move to bite the hand that feeds him. He shits on Biden, Biden shits on him. Elon drops memes like he is 14 years old mocking the establishment, and he has a very large following - that makes him a target. 

**Indian Giver:** He demands the Gov pay for his starlink service for ukraine when the gov, nor ukraine, never asked him to save the day like that. You don't invite your friend to dinner, then complain and ask them to pay for it after the fact. Indian giving is a bitch move. 

**Conspiracy Theorist:** He promotes Russel Brands youtube channel. Sure MSM is total bullshit, but that doesn't make RB a source of truth. If you promote stuff like that, you are playing for the wrong team. The team that gets cancelled.  

**\[Redacted\]:** His is king of ""that which can't be named here"" the bros are and their coins are not doing so hot right now. Powell actively wants them gone. The social media influencers who promoted these pump and dump coins are facing their time in court, Elon is the main dude pumping.

**Not Green Enough:** The ""green"" left is starting to be alienated by Elon specifically. He is too rich, too successful, to capitalist. Lets not forget the cars themselves are not exactly ""green"" to produce and the whole idea of EVs being ""more green"" than ICE cars is a u argument that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. 

**Lack of Immunity:** He doesn't have ""founder control"" of TSLA. He actually can be removed, not saying he will or that he should, just stating it is possible. 

**False Promises:** He has a pending FSD lawsuit because - well, FSD is a complete lie. Its not even close and yet it is marketed AND SOLD as available. Many hundreds of thousands of people paid 10k for FSD, and it simply doesn't exist.  Where is the cyber truck? What is the deal with a robot 10 years behind Boston Dynamics and Honda? Bullet proof glass? Semi truck deliveries? Bigger than Apple and Aramco? 

**Free Speech:** The Twitter purchase removes the ""town square"" from the free speech arena. It is now private speech, controlled by one individual. It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the ""real"" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.  

I had another post on [TSLA as a stock losing its growth trajectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and I recommended [everyone sell calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) which everyone criticized but turned into gains for me. 

I have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of ""person"" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today. 

What do you guys think the chances are of Elon being socially ""cancelled"" - or there at least being an attempt - in the next 12 months? Is his popularity and influence fading along with his market cap? Can Elon be cancelled?",Elon Will Get Cancelled Soon,1.0,2022-10-27 20:30:10

Let's talk about the elephant in the room first. Taiwan and China relations are not the best at the moment. This is generating a substantion geopolitical risk for Gogoro. The ones who suspect that China will invade Taiwan anytime soon should stop reading at this point and skip to the next thread. However, the ones who think that China is far too busy with other topics at the moment than trying to invade Taiwan and risking their already poor economical performance with sanctions are free to check this opportunity out.

As a typical SPAC company Gogoro's journey in Nasdaq has been a bumpy ride down (with very low volume). In addition to overall SPAC sentiment, geopolitical risks, covid restrictions and challenges in first overseas expansion efforts in China the financial performance is relatively good. The company has a solid revenue stream, finance muscles for expansion and increasing userbase (sticky users who pay monthly subscriptions). There is room to grow in Taiwan (population 25 million) but main opportunity lies in countries like India, Indonesia and other south east asian countires with high scooter usage.

Gogoro's product is second to none in the market. In industry reviews Gogoro is in top position in battery swapping for two wheelers. I've been checking out multiple competitor products and my honest subjective opinion is that Gogoro simply seems to be the best. Marketing material etc. is top notch like Apple or Tesla for example. Other competitor's products looks like some garage engineering start ups :) As a clarification the main idea for Gogoro is to build battery swapping network so that other manufacturers could use the Powered By Gogoro Network (a bit like Android). They already have 10+ manufactures onboard.

Maybe the most serious competitor is Gachaco (I always need to Google the name as I can't remember it). It's based on Honda's technology and looks pretty decent. There are also plenty of companies planning to build a scooter based on that product. However, just by checking the product and marketing material I'm not fully convinced. Compared to Gogoro there are additional steps when switching the batteries and the overall marketing material isn't so good and appealing to public (my personal opinion). They have launced small pilots in Japan and India but there obviously seems to be a very long road ahead of them to improve their product and there surely is lot to catch up with Gogoro which has around 10 years experience of finetuning the product and services (AI etc.). Also even if the Gachaco would grow their market share then there still is a room for couple of players. It is also nice to know that scooters can have multiple battery variations as for example Yamaha has scooters in Taiwan which are based on Gogoro technology.

CEO Horace Luke who has background in innovating Xbox and succesfully launcing HMD phones in the past is very capable guy. He has a passion to sustainability and no suprise he was the one who initiated battery swapping for two wheelers in the first place by inventing the products. Btw, his name is in many of the patents so really this guy knows what he is doing and is really hands in the sand guy with can do attitude.

No doubt Gogoro is a risky bet but the potential is also enormous. In a long run two wheeler's sustainability topic in big cities has to be addressed in a one way or another and battery swapping sounds much more practical than hundreds of millions of individual users charging with wires. Gogoro might or might not be the rainmaker in the industry in the next decade but it has a good chance. Successful India expansion would surely ensure a payday for all $GGR investors (especially for the ones who have loaded up shares with $3 prices). For the ones who prefer less risk then it might be good idea to follow up the financial performance for some time as you can always jump on board a bit later.

I own plenty of Gogoro shares and I'm willing to take the risk at this point. However, I'm not a financial advisor so make your own dd :)",Gogoro $GGR is revealing its plans for India on Nov 3,1.0,2022-10-27 11:32:10

[Foxconn](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/2317-TW/) said Tuesday that its factory in Zhengzhou, China ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest assembly plant for [Apple‚Äôs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) iPhones ‚Äî was hit with a small Covid outbreak.

A spokesperson for the Taiwanese firm, officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group, told CNBC that operation and production at its Zhengzhou facility is ‚Äúrelatively stable with health and safety measures for employees being maintained.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the small number of employees affected by the pandemic, Foxconn, in compliance with local epidemic prevention policies, is providing the necessary guarantees for livelihoods, including material supplies, psychological comfort and responsive feedback,‚Äù the spokesperson added.

Foxconn said that the impact on the group is ‚Äúcontrollable‚Äù and the operating outlook for this quarter remains unchanged.

Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Zhengzhou, in central China‚Äôs Henan province, has been battling a new wave of Covid this month. The city has locked down some districts as China pushes ahead with its zero-Covid policy, using testing and lockdowns to try and tackle the virus.

 

Earlier this month, Foxconn implemented virus prevention measures such as requiring employees to have a Covid test within 24 hours of them entering the Zhengzhou premises and urged them to get vaccinated.

Foxconn‚Äôs position highlights the balancing act required by manufacturing facilities to meet customer demand under Beijing‚Äôs strict Covid policy.

Apple still relies heavily on China for the majority of its iPhone production, but the Cupertino giant has looked to diversify its supply chain.

Last month, Apple said that it has begun assembling its flagship [iPhone 14 in India](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/apple-starts-manufacturing-the-iphone-14-in-india.html).

255,1666822917,yeasba,1,"Well today was one wild day that‚Äôs for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a ‚Äúlevel to level‚Äù play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren‚Äôt stopping out too soon (this is why I didn‚Äôt chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key resistance- 385 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple‚Ä¶. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough.

You know those little maps that say ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak‚Ä¶ apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover‚Ä¶ its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3770

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn‚Äôt very bullish‚Ä¶ 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing‚Ä¶ technically Tesla beat but missed revenue‚Ä¶ its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before‚Ä¶ But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don‚Äôt know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 145.5

Key resistance- 150.9 -&gt; 152.4

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today‚Ä¶ So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -&gt; 214.4 -&gt; 209.9 -&gt; 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234

As if the VIX couldn‚Äôt become anymore detached from reality‚Ä¶ we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers‚Ä¶ however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That‚Äôs really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn‚Äôt planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it‚Äôs a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

The issue we have now is that MSFT and Google earnings apparently did not go very well and that is causing a pretty significant red after hours. As I am writing this SPY is down about -0.9%. 

We were able today to push pretty green and we broke through the last resistance of the bear channel level from the August sell off. That is pretty bullish. With this earnings miss we could look for a healthy pull back to reconfirm support after a pretty large 3 day green move up. Or this could end up being the next peak of the bear market rally and we start our descent downward to the 350s/ 360s. For me until we break that red bull channel support I will remain bullish. I will also be watching closely for what we do at that 378.2 support level. Tomorrow could actually have a really impressive red day and still maintain the red bull channel.

Looks like futures was able to cover no mans land as I called it yesterday which ranged from 3805 to 3875.

Apple continues to look quite stout and strong despite the rest of the Market. Apple was able to make a move all the way up to its 100ema today falling just short of closing above it.

I dare say I was impressed with tesla today! It perfectly hit my first target of 223 (unfortunately I closed my calls way too early). However, today we saw tesla once again hold support and actually had one of the most bullish days I have seen in a very long time. However, in the end it fell just short of 222.5 resistance. We have a nice diamond pattern formed here where you can see Tesla rejected on its upside move today. Tesla still could see a retracement but it is showing some signs of bullishness after it established 206 as support. 

Tomorrow or later this week I will need to see Tesla break through that blue bear channel in order to believe in a bigger move up to 230s. If we continue to see the trend of sell off followed by a rogue green day that only brings further downside and we close back under 205 at any point I will be looking at puts.

Terrible timing‚Ä¶ but the VIX finally sold off. We finally broke the bull channel and we even retested that key 28.4 level, however, we ended up bouncing pretty hard off of it. With these earnings coming in and this hugely red after hours it will be interesting to see what the VIX does tomorrow. 

10% challenge- 

Overall a great day that was heavily support by some level to level plays I made.

Granted especially Tesla which went on to almost triple the profits from where I closed them I had some pretty stout wins this morning on my level to level wins. With earnings coming out tonight and being gone at the EOD I decided it was best to sit cash gang overnight. I will be looking to see where thing settle tomorrow by EOD and will look for some level to level plays there.

I was able to play a few level to level plays intraday today for some smaller profits. I got greedy on them but didn‚Äôt let them go red. I suspect tomorrow to be able to have a few of these level to level plays to play again. SPY lately really has been respecting key pivot support/ resistance levels.

April 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB and all the hype of a potential MSFT buyout, we all know how that went, but fuck you that's not the point. Fast forward 18 months and it‚Äôs clear that the price action in April 2021 was just an amuse bouch√©e for what will happen next.

Developments since April 2021 include:
Mavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It‚Äôs getting worse by the week as daily we are seeing trading largely Algo driven as with a lot of the market, liquidity is drying up and shorts are passing blocks between themselves to drive the price down. Some wrinkle brains with actual knowledge of how the market works have counts in the range of 100million shares short total on MVIS, a big difference from the 24% currently reported. Average short volume for the past 30 days is a whopping 70.36% with off exchange volume for the past 30 days touching 34.08%. Given many stocks are highly shorted right now I don't want to hear any slabbering, I know this shit man, but with a product as delicious as MAVIN Dr just being trademarked, and the fact they provided the light engine which made the Hololens 2 possible, and lets face it, if MSFT are using MVIS for the Hololens 2 they sure as hell are using it for the IVAS which secured MSFT that ball tingling $22bili contract with the US military. This is a ticking time bomb ready to fuck any short brave enough to touch it. Hiya Kenny.
 
MVIS have a cash runway for 2 years. They have negligible debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. Which given the state of the world right now is a golden arrow in their quiver, many of these competitors aren't likely to make it to production without seriously diluting their shareholders... I'm looking at you Omer(INVZ CEO for those unaware) who on the 29th of September announced Mixed shelf registration for up to $200million... CEO claims they don't need it but have done so for ""good business practices"".... Check his twitter comments stating such. I call bullshit, enough said.

MVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. 
MVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an ‚ÄúOEM friendly‚Äù white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor. Which the company has filed trademark registration for on 10/11/2022 https://uspto.report/TM/97628161 notice the smaller form factor compared to the original postings on linkedIn 
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/microvision_autosens-automotivelidar-activity-6975685318729490432-Hy3B?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop

Now the company has stated the form factor will get smaller when ASIC is completed... Is this the final smaller form or will we see another size decrease... We can only speculate for now..

Mavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. This has been tested and demonstrated to Some OEM (it hasn't been declared who) in Germany where the company has Offices set up as of last year... Someone wants MVIS in Germany...

Mavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. 

Mavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.

Mavin is available to OEMs via the NVDA platform.
MVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&amp;A. Feeling like Pac-Man munching up these dots.. Nom, Nom, Nom. 

MVIS currently has 3 vacancies for ASIC design engineers https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/
To which the CEO Sumit Sharma stated last year that it is not cost effective to design an ASIC unless they have secured orders for 1.2-1.5 million units... What does that tell you???

Sumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! Listen. Some clampets out there are stating that such a certification is capable of being self-certed.. to which I respond... Why the delay then bitch??? Because just like everything in this shitshow of a world since Covid, THERE ARE DELAYS.

MVIS said in the Jan 2022 investor slides that they would be ready for partnerships this year. Now that Class 1 certification has been achieved, MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! To which Sample sales have already started and are being shipped off to the big knobs with fat ass check books as we speak...

Single Unit - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/3.jpg
5 Unit case - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/4.jpg
Talk about classy..

MVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July‚Äôs earnings call. Now they have the class 1 certification, those orders have been shipped. They quoted one OEM as saying ‚ÄúMavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen‚Äù. Sumit‚Äôs character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. Now, when I say Sumit is a humble man I certainly believe that to be the case, he is an engineer, so he gets rightfully excited when talking about the product and what the company has achieved with such, and in my opinion has no need to be a boisterous character like we see in some of the competitors, *cough* Austin Russell *cough* which tells me a lot about the company and the product they are offering...
 
The MVIS executive bonus scheme was launched this summer and it rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36. Todays opening price was $3.49. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! The tiered executive bonus scheme is organised as such that management doesn't get awarded shares unless the share price reaches the thresholds and stays there for 20 days. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. This is the real deal, and will make you enough money to finally move your way up from sleeping at the bottom of your wife and her many boyfriends bed.   

Their investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market. 

They have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  

In January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That‚Äôs a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple deals are expected to be signed over the next 9-10 months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. 

In addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which as previously mentioned only exists because of MVIS tech! 

https://youtu.be/OmiQvjQuFqQ

Done so by a very fine Redditor who took it upon himself after countless hours or research following patents etc to prove once and for all that MVIS are the dogs balls and have the tech so well patented and perfected that the biggest, baddest tech companies in the world cannot make this tech as good as this for themselves. Hiya Meta and APPL. Now MSFT had MVIS by the balls when this deal was struck as the company could well have been facing bankruptcy if it wasn't for the savage group of investors who put so much into this company, they staved off the relentless shorting and helped bring about the savage short squeeze we seen in April 2021.... This company has made so many people life changing amounts of money... But guess what, they ain't fucking done yet. People still buying shares when its right for them as they know the life changing money they have already made will be made again...   

Many AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. 
Then factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, and no one is selling. We all know what we own. 
It‚Äôs going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price.  There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  it‚Äôs inevitable.

Oh yeah EC is this Thursday.. Not expecting any mind blowing or even significant revenue changes, anyone expecting such will be sorely disappointed, but that is not the point. The business updates and hearing the confidence in managements statements is enough to get you harder than a couple little blue boys and your Mrs standing with a big red dildo to fuck you harder than the market has this year.

Listen, I could post DD for days on this company but you degenerate fucks are probably only going to read the TLDR and tell me to ""short squeeze these nuts"" (Fuck you Automod) buy shares, LEAPs if you must, but do not play into the MMs hand by buying weeklies or I'm going to come fuck you myself.

TLDR; this is in my opinion the most highly researched company on the market, the DD is phenomenal, and the company has the meat to follow. They cannot make a move without retail hot on their tail... And management KNOW THIS... Fuck the shorts, lasers are the future and MVIS knows lasers better than anyone.  PEW PEW

P.s THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY, although, the fact it is so highly shorted is just some extra fuel for when a deal is announced i'm telling you now so you have a chance to get in not far off what has so far been the bottom... What happens between now and a deal being announced is anyone's guess, but this is a damn good place to join the roller-coaster.

Apple will report its fourth-quarter earnings for the quarter ending in September after the bell on Thursday.

The most important new information in the results will be any details on how the iPhone 14 series is selling.

Many investors will be watching to see if Apple‚Äôs newest iPhones, which went on sale late in the quarter, are on pace for a growth cycle or if global macroeconomic conditions have finally started to weigh on the high-end electronics market.

Apple hasn‚Äôt offered official guidance since 2020, initially citing uncertainty driven by the pandemic. But Apple management has offered individual data points each quarter that allows analysts to back into the ability to forecast Apple‚Äôs sales.

Here‚Äôs what Wall Street is expecting, according to FactSet estimates:

Revenue: $88.79 billion

EPS: $1.27

Wall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market‚Äôs most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy‚Äôs health.

On the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) ‚Äì which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index ‚Äì will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.

A bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

 

Earnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.

For this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.

Earnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn‚Äôt leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla‚Äôs revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

 

On Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.

Strength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback‚Äôs 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.

That headwind is expected to show up in Amazon‚Äôs results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate‚Äôs revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that ‚Äúforeign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs"" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.

  

For Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted ‚Äúdemand has held up better than expected in recent months.‚Äù

Meta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech‚Äôs 72-hour earnings rollout.

Other notable financial results on tap include the Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), General Electric ([GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE)), General Motors ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)), Ford Motor ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), Comcast ([CMCSA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)), Visa ([V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V)), Mastercard ([MA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA)), and Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM)), among others.

In economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings ‚Äì which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER‚Äôs panel of economists must officially declare a recession.

Economic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

 

According to Pantheon Economics‚Äô Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.

‚ÄúBut the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,‚Äù Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",Yahoo Finance Big Tech earnings and GDP data,1.0,2022-10-24 02:46:56

Economic Data

Tuesday:

The Commerce Department releases its report on August sales of new homes in the U.S. New-home sales fell 12.6% in July compared with June.

The Conference Board publishes its September consumer-confidence index, which measures U.S. attitudes toward jobs and the economy. Consumer confidence improved in August after falling for three consecutive months.

Wednesday

The National Association of Realtors reports the number of home sales based on contract signings in August. Pending home sales declined in July for the second consecutive month as high mortgage rates and elevated home prices diminished demand.

Thursday

The Commerce Department publishes a third estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product‚Äîa broad measure of the goods and services produced in an economy‚Äîafter its second estimate showed that the decline in U.S. economic output during that time was less severe than initially estimated. The second estimate showed that the economy contracted at a 0.6% annual rate in the April-through-June period, a slower pace than the 0.9% decline initially estimated, driven in part by an upward revision of consumer spending.

China‚Äôs National Bureau of Statistics and S&amp;P Global release September surveys of purchasing managers about economic activity in China‚Äôs manufacturing sector. China‚Äôs agency also releases a separate survey measuring the country‚Äôs nonmanufacturing sector.

Friday

The European Union‚Äôs statistics agency releases September inflation figures for the 19-nation eurozone. The bloc‚Äôs consumer prices were 9.1% higher in August than the same month a year earlier, the fastest pace since records began in early 1997.

The University of Michigan publishes its final reading of consumer sentiment for September. Its initial estimate earlier in the month showed it had ticked up from August‚Äôs final reading.

# TL;DR

I'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:  

1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.
2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**  
3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble. 
4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone. 
5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.  
6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do. 
7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)

You see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.

# 3. Chips

Not sure what computers have to do with potatoes, but we are dealing with a bag of Lays right now.  You know how you buy a bag in line at the store, and then you open it and there is like 6 chips and air?  We are in a chip shortage and it is affecting everything.  I'll leave most of this discussion to the comments because the severity of what is going on needs to be mulled over. I can't help but think this is catastrophic.  Someone correct me. Please.

The remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.

They‚Äôre in the process of creating technology to produce/capture heavy oil and make it economically viable. 

They have contracts all over the world with government and large scale oil/gas producers in the upstream/midstream/downstream oil and gas sector. The create software for drilling rigs and oil refineries. They have pumping technology that uses pressure to pull oil out of newly fracked wells. They hold many patents and have intellectual property rights all over the world. They create equipment to optimize the amount of oil you can get out of a well and have successfully created technology to extend the life of wells previously thought to be worthless. They also have revolutionized the industry through horizontal drilling tech. When the first round of fracking technology in the US caused some major companies to loose a lot of money when the wells ended up not producing as much as conventional wells. This company had a big role in changing that. It‚Äôs the second shale oil revolution and these guys are leading the charge.

I was 100% not expecting a green day and let me tell you if someone woulda told me that we would go from a -1% pre market to closing at 2.43% green today I woulda laughed in their faces. From the lowest point to the highest point SPY moved $12.3 up. 

So where does that leave us? 

Well lets take a look at a few MACRO things first here. Next week is the week before FOMC (November 2nd). Now generally if we look at the previous FOMCS 5 out of the 6 last pre-FOMC weeks finished green averaging about a -4.41% drop. However, if we look at July you can see it was the only week where SPY finished green all year. What was the difference? Well that was back when they started the fed pivot/ inflation is getting better narrative. So I ask myself‚Ä¶ are we in a inflation sucks, feds never going to stop hiking environment OR are we in an inflation is peaking and feds going to slow the big hikes soon? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don‚Äôt like to include so many tweets in my TA but I find these to be VERY important. So lets break this down here‚Ä¶ Next week is the week before FOMC. November 2nd will be FOMC. Followed by the next CPI reading the following week on November 10th. 

So what does that mean. Today Bullard and Daly pretty much said without saying it and the WSJ article said that the fed is most likely going to do a 75bps hike on November 2nd. Once that hike is done in order to not over due it with rate hikes and cause a market crash/ collapse the economy they are most likely going to ‚Äúpullback‚Äù to a 25 or 50bps hike. While this is NOT a pause what this is‚Ä¶ is a clear slowing of rate hikes from the mouths of the fed themselves. This is one of the first times we have actually heard them discuss slowing or a lesser rate hike. 

Why is this all important and how does it effect next week? Well the fed is now in a quiet period. What does that mean? That means no fed member can speak publicly to the press or say anything else until FOMC happens. They just left us with some extreme bullish news (even more bullish then when we rallied back in July-August). 

My thoughts are this‚Ä¶ next week we rally on this news and expectations of a 75bps hike followed by a 25-50bps hike in December. The week of FOMC we rally when JPOW confirms this news. Then this is when it gets tricky (and I don‚Äôt have the CPI consensus numbers yet to give an accurate probability of what CPI will be) but there is a chance that CPI will miss again and even if it does miss there is a chance that we will see markets rally instead of dropping just like the Septembers. Why? Because markets know that even if the CPI is bad the FED is going to slow its rate hikes. So unless JPOW says something different on November 2nd I would be bullish for the new two weeks minimum. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the SPY daily chart we actually have a really nice W pattern forming. What I am seeing is that today should have been our chance to retest the lower lows of the 350s however we rallied instead. With this daily candle being a two day (almost 3 day) bullishly engulfing candle with a double bottom off 365.1 from here I would expect upside. We have been trading in this grey channel for a full month now. The key resistance for this channel lies at 378.2 and the overall bear channel (blue dotted line) resistance from the August top lies at 378.8 from Monday. If we break through and close over those levels then in the next week or two we should look for a retest of the 390 level. However, if we reject that 378.2 level then I would be looking for us to maintain this grey channel and puts would be the most probable play. 

Daily supports- 370.5 -&gt; 365.2 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.5

Daily resistance- 374.3 -&gt; 378.2 -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.3

On the SPY weekly we have a very V double bottom forming and we closed back over the weekly 200ema for the first time in a month. However we did fall just short of breaking through and closing over the daily 8ema. While we are still in this black bear channel right now that dates back to August. If SPY breaks through 374.3 at any point Monday or next week we will be through the bear channel resistance and that will open up the upside with a target of 382 to 385. 

Weekly support- 363.7 -&gt; 357 -&gt; 348

Weekly resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 385.4

As you can see I am long on calls for SPY next week.

Looking at the futures daily chart I feel like the overall V bottom is even more clear. This was a fairly bullish close as the futures daily candle not only backtested and held support at 3675 to form a double bottom it also fully bull engulfed the previous 3 trading days and closed over key resistance of 3760. 

Futures will look to target 3880 next week as the next major daily resistance level. 

Daily support- 3708 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3586

Daily resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3875

Futures weekly also has a nice V bottom but more notable had a major support area now at 3590 that has been held for 4 weeks in a row now. Futures weekly too closed over the weekly 200ema ofr the first time in a month but did fall short of breaking through its bear channel resistance and daily 8ema. However, unless we see futures Monday open down below 3690 (-2%+ red open) and hold that level all week we will see the futures weekly pattern broken through. This will open up the upside to retest the next resistance level at 3900 which notably is just over the JPM collar of 3870. 

Weekly support- 3705 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3500

Weekly resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3890

On Apples daily I had called out earlier in the week that Apple was through its August bear channel resistance. However, as soon as it poked through it sold off. I was bearish based on that sell off, however, Apple has found some heavy support on its daily 8ema and at this point has broken through 145.4 resistance and wicked over the next major resistance of 147.5. With a close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September (SPY also closed over its daily 20ema) this is a pretty bullish sign moving forward. 

I will be watching that key red v bottom support very closely next week. The next major resistance level to break on the daily is 149.3.

Daily support- 145.5 -&gt; 142.9 -&gt; 141 -&gt; 138.2

Daily resistance- 147.6 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.7

The Apple weekly bear channel has also not been broken yet. However, with 3 week strong support put in at that key 138.2 support level and a nice v bottom support bounce‚Ä¶ Apple was able to close over its weekly 8ema for the first time since the week of August 22nd. I will be looking for apple to test that bear channel resistance and break through it next week. Much like SPY unless Apple opens and holds red below 147.3 all week it will take out that bear channel resistance and open the upside. 

Apple posts earnings on October 27th also to keep in mind. 

Weekly support- 141.2 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 133.4

Weekly resistance- 147.3 -&gt; 150.5 -&gt; 155.9

Now Tesla is the wild child of the bunch. I actually had even mentioned in my TA yesterday that I almost was convinced of buying longer DTE calls on tesla because of how hard it bounced and how well it held that 205 support area. Well today reconfirmed my bullish suspicions. I am looking for Tesla to break through that bear channel Monday and see a bigger push up. After putting its 52week low in this week and being absolutely beaten down for the last month straight‚Ä¶ Tesla is poised for a big bounce if the markets bounce. 

Daily support- 206.3 -&gt; 196

Daily resistance- 215 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 233.6

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla weekly finally for the first time in 5 weeks broke its resistance line. With a nice bounce off 205 I am looking for a bigger push up. While this is not a true double bottom I am looking for that 205 support level to hold. There is always a chance we could retest it early next week but I believe Tesla will seek upside from here as long as the rest of the market is doing the same. 

Tesla has a pretty big no mans land from 223 to 255 area. After the May/ June low it spent a lot of time consolidating there before it finally pushed for the 300s. I would expect tesla to attempt to close somewhere inside that range next week. 

Weekly support- 205 -&gt; 191.9 -&gt; 167.8 

Weekly resistance- 223 -&gt; 254.7 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see with SPY, Apple and Tesla I am attempting to add some Level to Level plays (as I call them) into my trading. I have been absolutely killing it with scalps lately but I see an opportunity as of late to enter some longer DTE plays and play these key level breakouts and break downs. I look forward to incorporating them as time goes on, but also recognizing that not every day or week will have level to level play. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utnevgarx8v91.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a23b9e30200aa2d37b14423cc4ab7d006ba8f3

And then there was the VIX. Now you would think with SPY moving $12+ from pre market to HOD and having a nearly 2.5% green day that we would see the VIX massively unwind right? Well you would be wrong. The craziest thing is that as SPY rose the 2nd half of the day the VIX actually rose with it. Now I have said this numerous times but I really just don‚Äôt believe the VIX anymore. However, the key takeaway is we close below the daily 8ema and below the daily 20ema for the first time since middle of September. However, we did not lose the bull channel support just yet. This is the last piece to the bullish puzzle. 

10% challenge-

Overall a pretty good day for me today and a pretty great week overall. Not my best win rate by far but overall $$ and % gains was great this week. 

As I was saying below is an example of some of the LEVEL to LEVEL plays I am going to start incorporating into my own trading that I hope allows me outside of my scalps to capture more gains and more moves.

The disappearing stock price for Snap continues after another challenging quarter.

Shares of the social media platform crashed 25% in pre-market trading on Friday as third quarter sales marked the fifth straight quarterly deceleration. Profits were also lackluster as Snap continued to blame an advertising slowdown and Apple privacy changes for the execution missteps.

Here's a snapshot of Snap's dismal numbers:

* **Net Sales:** $1.13 billion vs. $1.14 billion estimate
* **Daily Active Users:** 363 million vs. 358 million estimate
* **Average Revenue Per User:** $3.11 vs. $3.17 estimate
* **Adjusted EPS:** $0.08 vs. estimated loss of $0.02
* **Guidance:** ""Flat"" revenue growth seen in the fourth quarter

The company warned sales trends in the fourth quarter would get worse.

Snap shares were tops on the Yahoo Finance '[Trending Ticker](https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers)' page through early morning.

EvercoreISI analyst [Mark Mahaney](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-is-a-broken-growth-story-top-tech-analyst-174325345.html) said Snap's Q3 results negatively surprised them. ""We had assumed that the August improvement Snap disclosed in early September would hold for the quarter. Instead, Snap's revenue trends were a very volatile 0% year over year in July, mid-teens % growth year over year in August, and low single-digit % growth year over year in September‚Ä¶even with comps easing from the Platform Policy Changes, which began in early Q3:21,"" he said.

""And we think it likely that the recent major personnel changes at SNAP ‚Äì the loss of key ad execs to Netflix ‚Äì has exacerbated the headwinds,"" Mahaney added.

 Analyst spotlight

Jefferies analyst [Brent Thill](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/facebook-move-metaverse-optical-illusion-143959906.html) sees three problems with the stock. He's sticking with a Buy rating on Snap in the wake of the disastrous third quarter. But the long-time tech analyst sees three problems ahead that may still not be priced into Snap's deeply discounted stock price:

* *""Q4 rev guidance implies significant growth deceleration. While Snap has seen its revenue growth accelerate to +9% year over year quarter to date, management is still only forecasting flat year over year growth for Q4. Weakness in brand advertising appears to be the main source of the steep deceleration, but we think there could also be conservatism embedded. In our view, Q1'23 may be the bottom for revenue growth, with gradual acceleration through 2023 on easing comparisons.*
* *It's difficult to parse out how many of Snap's issues are transitory. The weakening macro backdrop is partially to blame for soft results, but we question how much is due to the iOS privacy issues and competitive threats. We view the competitive threats as most concerning given the potential long-term implications for the platform.*
* *20% headcount reductions and executive departures could cause further disruptions. We worry that Snap's reorganization could lead advertisers to slow or even pause their spending. Given Snap had been growing headcount over 30% year over year for 4 straight quarters, we wonder if the company can execute on its lofty growth objectives with a 20% smaller employee base.""*

Taking a look at SPY daily we got a really nice head and shoulders pattern forming. I mentioned that big run up we just had looked a lot like October 3rd and 4th. If that is true (which I do believe) then today was October 6th and we should push down from here. 

I am looking for a retest by next week of 356-360 support. If that support breaks then we could be looking for a new 52 week low. 

Keep in mind that next week is the week before FOMC meeting and generally speaking 5 out of the last 6 weeks before FOMC have been red averaging a -3% to -5% drop.

Futures lost that key 3680 support I was talking about and looks to be closing back under it and under the daily 8ema just like SPY did today. With the loss of 3680 I suspect a retest of that key 3590 support area.

I am bearish on apple, however, I would like to see it lose and close under its daily 8ema, however it did hard reject the daily 20ema today again. Apple put in a really massive gravestone doji today just like Spy did. This candle should be a reversal candle and should lead to a downside test. I do expect a test of at least 138.2 by end of next week.

Tesla has been on an absolute wild sell off for the last month with no end in sight. We found support at that 205 range today bouncing off of it twice today. I was actually a little impressed to see Tesla bounce how it did this morning as I really thought we might just breach through 200 today. However it looks like after putting a new 52 week low in today that we will have to wait and see where it goes. Overall I am bearish on Tesla and I am looking for 170-180 by end of next week also.

Honestly the VIX is telling a mixed story here. It doesn‚Äôt quite want to sell off, however it doesn‚Äôt quite want to rip up either. Today we saw spy close almost -1% and yet the VIX actually unwound slightly. 

I am still holding bearish until that key 28.4 level is broken. 

10% challenge-

Today was a great day for me. Played a few tesla plays too and closed a few swings I had been holding and averaged down. 

I am bearish for the next week leading into FOMC November 2nd.

## Aapl is entirely fucked.

This is not in my usual wheelhouse of plays (tiny companies, under-priced relative to their potential), so hey everything you read from here-on out could be wrong in a thousand ways. Anyway‚Ä¶ 

Let‚Äôs imagine you find $2.3T in your jacket pocket this morning. Fuck that is a lot of money. Guess you better invest it well. You decide you‚Äôre going to buy AAPL. **At $2.3T you could buy all of it and take it private** (well, not realistically as the more you bought the higher the price would go, etc). 

Regardless, you are now out $2.3T in cash upfront but you bought Apple, all of it. You control the entire company, and **you get to keep all the profits as your personal income forever.** 

Cool, that must be a lot of money, right? Let‚Äôs see. Over the last year that‚Äôs - oh wow -[ **$100B of net income**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/net-income) **you get to keep every year! Amazing!!**

Except wait. $100B divided by your investment of $2.3T‚Ä¶ is **only a 4.3% yield on your investment**‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs **only IF apple continues making $100B**

1. ‚Ä¶ into a coming global recession‚Ä¶ 
2. ‚Ä¶while the drop in international currencies relative to the dollar is already going to reduce its revenues and net profits in dollar denominated terms ‚Ä¶ (At least most of their revenue comes through in USD right? **Nope.** [Non-US revenue makes up over 60% of Apple's revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263435/non-us-share-of-apples-revenue/)) (At least they‚Äôre hedged right? **Nope** [‚ÄúUS tech giants slashed FX hedges before EM currencies plunged‚Äù](https://www.eurofinance.com/news/us-tech-giants-slashed-fx-hedges-before-em-currencies-plunged/#:~:text=Consider%20computer%20giant%20Apple%2C%20which,net%20investments%20in%20foreign%20subsidiaries) **Oops)**
3. ‚Ä¶and don‚Äôt forget that $100B reflects an uncharacteristic bump probably driven by one-time massive phenomena (stimulus iphones and work-from-home macbook pros).

&amp;#x200B;

[Aapl saw a revenue bump due during the pandemic](https://preview.redd.it/xmz39v4ge0v91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b61da64cbd1a7046fb1d93a8732aff4bd6651e)

 

So for buying aapl, you get a 4.3% return on your capital every year, with some risk that apple‚Äôs profits don‚Äôt sustain. And **you have to run the world‚Äôs largest, most complicated, business with a massively global tight-ass supply chain**.. Just to earn 4.3% on your fucking money.

**Or‚Ä¶**

You could just buy this

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v0xaddpke0v91.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b820153591074b7a01da344b92b99282bba292c0

 

You could buy the **least riskiest financial asset on the planet** and get 4.22% for the next 10 years, guaranteed. 

So 

**Option 1:** Use $2.3T to buy Apple to hope and get the 4.3% a year assuming Apple makes $100B in net income

**Option 2:** Put $2.3T into 10y treasuries and get 3.827% guaranteed

What would you do?

Oh, and if you happen to be insane enough to **still** choose Apple, guess what? The Fed has just told you that they‚Äôre going to keep raising rates another 125 bps, which means that the 10Y yield may not even have topped out yet.

So at some point the situation might look like this:

Option 1: Buy and Manage Apple to hope **and get the 4.3%** a year every year

Option 2: Buy 10y treasuries **and get 5.0%.**

There may be some smooth-brained trillionaires that choose option 1 in the first scenario above, but there is 0 rational reason to choose to buy Apple if rates are going above 5.0%. 

**Oh yeah, and that 4.3% rate? That‚Äôs basically what P/E tells you. Apple‚Äôs P/E is 1 / 0.043 = 23** (this is not the exact value as I rounded the 4.3 above).

Anyway, so you‚Äôre earning a 4.3% yield now, i.e. you‚Äôre paying a P/E of 23 now, which is **less than a .1% premium on treasuries.** 

**‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been‚Äù you say in your one-nut voice.** 

**No, that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs always been, you sidewalk-pooper.** 

Here‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs P/E history. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y1naqzdoe0v91.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f431a97c453d968df6d472b7efb5dde3d998a590

 

**Apple‚Äôs P/E is historically high**, and **therefore your yield for owning Apple is historically low.** 

A risk asset that is at lows for yield in terms of recent history when yields on the risk-free asset are high in terms of recent history is a bad combination. 

You could argue Apple‚Äôs P/E is not that high, since it was close to 23 in December of 2019. **But then 10y treasury yields were less than 2% and on their way down**, so you were getting more than 2% extra on your money vs buying treasuries (which I would argue is too little as well).

**The only way Apple‚Äôs valuation lasts here is if a) the 10y treasury yield drops or b) apple significantly grows its earnings.**  

And if it misses earnings? Not only will the ‚ÄúE‚Äù come down but the P/E ratio will drop as well, **until investors get back to at least a 2% premium over 10y treasuries.**

That‚Äôs a yield of 5.8% against today‚Äôs 3.8% paid on the risk-free side, which means a P/E ratio of **16,** corresponding to a **31% drop in Apple‚Äôs share price just if P/E contracts to where it should be given 10y yields**, and more than that if Apple‚Äôs forward revenue is anything less than $100B. 

A 31% share drop puts it at $100. 

So, I‚Äôm buying puts. Apple is scheduled to release earnings on the 27th, so I‚Äôve got some puts for after earnings and then some 2023 puts as well. 

One could also short aapl on its own, short it relative to the S&amp;P / 10yr treasuries, or short leap calls. I‚Äôve got a mix of positions with the nearest-dated being 145p 10/28. I‚Äôm also saving some capital to short after earnings, particularly if earnings are weak. 

## Counterpoints

* Apple is still buying back stock. Fewer shares available + same passive net inflows = Apple gets bid up by passive. However, unclear whether it fits fiduciary duty for Apple to continue to buy back shares given yields currently. 
* Apple‚Äôs revenues and earnings could increase with the release of the new gen iphone models &amp; other hardware (macbooks, etc.); or their market share could grow for any other reason
* They could release a car, a new AR/VR headset, or some other product that lifts revenue meaningfully
* For some reason, people spend more on in-app purchases than they did during the pandemic when they were stuck at home
* Apple grows revenue from its ever-increasing portfolio of connected products (airpods, etc.)
* Apple is at its core a pretty good company (but the stock is high), so people could divert money to Apple in a flight to safety.

* Apple and Aramco are the world's top two companies by market capitalization.
* The combined market cap of Aramco and Apple is six times that of Tesla, at today's stock price.¬†

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, said on Wednesday his electric vehicle company could become more valuable than the world's two largest companies ‚Äî Apple and Saudi Aramco.

The combined market capitalization of tech giant Apple and Saudi Arabian state energy giant Aramco is around $4.4 trillion today. In comparison, Tesla's market cap is about $690 billion. This means Tesla would have to grow roughly six times its current size to catch up.

""I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,"" said Musk, according to a transcript of Tesla's earnings call on October 19. He acknowledged it'll be tough, but it can be achieved with ""a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.""

Musk made the ambitious statement on Wednesday after Tesla reported record revenues of $21.45 billion in the third quarter of 2022 ‚Äî although it fell short of the $21.96 billion analysts were estimating, per IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also posted a profit of $3.29 billion in the quarter running from July to September ‚Äî just under a record profit of $3.3 billion reported in the first quarter of this year.

Tesla Q3 '22 EPS - $1.05

Tesla Q3 '21 EPS - $.48

Tesla TTM eps $3.33. At the current SP of $208 (after hours), that puts PE ratio at 62. Down almost 20 points from it's current PE due to earnings growth. 

Meta - Between Q3 '21 and Q2 '22, EPS have declined by 23%, with an even bigger decline YOY once their Q3 earnings come out.

Amazon - Q3 '21 eps were $0.31 and Q2 '22 eps were negative (-0.20). Maybe they'll get some support from Rivian SP going up around 30% between beginning Q3 and end of Q3, but their operating margins are still lousy in this inflationary environment. They're up against a tough comparison for Q3 '21 so their TTM EPS will likely further decrease, pushing up their PE ratio and putting pressure on share price.

Google - EPS have decreased from $1.40 in Q3 '21 to $1.20 for Q2 '22. We'll have to see what Q3 brings, but likely it'll be less than the $1.4 eps they made in Q3 '21.

Even apple is seeing eps decline. 

My only point is that we've been in an earnings recession within big tech (and tech in general) for the past several quarters. Tesla has been one of the few outliers. Their eps growth has been explosive, where everyone else has been declining.

However, as I suspected futures called it with that gravestone doji yesterday and SPY with the hard rejection at 375 that we would see a retracement. Now the question is where do we go from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e64oqbpxvuu91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150998e587a305bb672e5f55a753b682d0ddd8fd

We still have our phantom print down at 357 that needs to be filled at some point and until something bigger or better than that shows up I have no reason to suspect that we don‚Äôt fill that this week or next. 

We did break that v bottom recovery line and now are forming a nice falling wedge that gives support down at the 340s for this/ next week. 

The biggest bullish case here is that SPY did hard bounce off its daily 8ema and hold that support well. We once again saw a massive fight happening at 368.7 today and we did end up barely closing below it. As I was saying above 368 and until 378 is broken I would be looking for downside to retest that 356 to 360 area. 360 remains my next target and with Tesla missing earnings we should see that happen tomorrow or the next day.

Taking a look at futures here we can see a break through of the V bottom support and as of now we are rejecting that daily 20ema level. Overall I am seeing continued evidence of downside. The one thing I do want to see in order to believe in a retest of that 3585 level is that we break through and close below 3680 support tomorrow. That was a key bounce area today and a key previous resistance level.

Apple overall doesn‚Äôt look terrible, but we saw once again a rejection of that key 143.8 level today and we saw a retest and rejection of the daily 20ema which should lead to more downside. 

With Tesla missing on earnings due to a beat of expectations but revenue short fall (I wish I could listened to the call to see what he had to say) I do wonder with Apples report of Iphone 14 production cut and now this tesla earnings if we see that trickle down to the rest of tech who reports next week.

I had been saying pretty much all week that I expected tesla COULD beat earnings but give poor guidance which would result in a sell off and well that‚Äôs pretty much exactly what happened today. I was actually even more bearish on earnings today seeing yesterdays massive rejection followed by the daily 8ema rejection‚Ä¶ its funny how the markets ‚Äúknow‚Äù when to not go too bullish ahead of time‚Ä¶

I will be watching key 205 support the most tomorrow and the rest of this week. If and when that support is broke/  closed below that is when I suspect tesla could start its descent to the 180s.

The VIX once again gave us zero direction and zero guidance of what to expect. The biggest thing I am noting is that the fear in the markets is not unwinding. To me that means we are not quite read for the next wave up. 

I zoomed out a little bit so we could look back at the June bottom. If you see there is quite the difference between the two times. Once that June 16th 52 week low was in the VIX had already ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù and already was on its descent down. The touch of the VIX on June 16th had a huge wick and after that it was a straight sell off. 

The biggest difference is that on the current VIX trend is that we put a new low in on October 13th and about 1 or 2 days before that we ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù however we are not seeing the same level of sell off now that we did then. And the overall downward resistance line from that peak was broken today. 

The VIX is still holding that 20ema support and we are still in that danger zone of 28.4 to 33. I struggle to be truly bullish that the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù is in and that we are going on a big rally until I see the vix break through that 28.4 support range.

Overall actually kind of a tough day to trade today. The biggest issue of the day was the IV and IV rank was so high from the previous day that the movements yesterday that were paying out an east 10-25% gains were barely paying 5% before it turned against you. It actually was very interesting to see how the premiums were moving today. 

A few times I noted in one specific Call play I was in that the price of SPY had fallen and fallen a decent amount where I definitely should have had my 20% stop loss hit, however, with the drop in SPY my call actually rose in value. Then once SPY did bounce my actual premium barely increased in value. It was almost like the actual movement of premiums was happening before the actual movement of SPY happened. I definitely caught a few plays where the technical setup of them looked perfect, however, caught a rogue bounce that stopped me out before I was able to capitalize. Overall a green day so no complaints but definitely a tough day to trade today.

Well we have officially filled the October 7th phantom range of 373.29. Now the question is do we fill the phantom range of 357.28 from yesterday? 

Currently we are through most of the bear channels on spy and tech, however we are NOT through SPYs august peak resistance line. We still need to see closer to 380 to test that. The biggest thing I am seeing right now is that SPY is holding 356.5 to 378.3 range for the last 19 trading days. We are in consolidation mode. The closer we get to 378.3 the more we should be eyeing a retest of 356. However, if we can truly breakout over 378.3 and retake 380 (50% retracement of bear channel) we can start thinking about a more significant dead cat bounce like July. 

368.7 is currently holding as a major support line. If and when that is broken that should signal more downside. Current daily candle is closing as a hanging man candle. I do like downside for tomorrow (look at October 4th for comparison).

Key support- 371 -&gt; 368.6 -&gt; 364 -&gt; 357

Key resistance- 375.1 -&gt; 378.3 -&gt; 382.2

Futures was able to break out yesterday over that key 3680 resistance line however todays candle closing as a huge bodied gravestone doji after this run up is bearish omen for tomorrow and rest of the week. Will be keeping a close eye on how this closes out tomorrow for a hint of the rest of the week. 

Futures is inside the same channel that SPY is form 3590 to 3805. With key support at 3680. 

Key support- 3680 -&gt; 3590

Key resistance- 3747 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3882

Apple is a hard one to get a good read on today. On one hand we had a nice breakout over that black resistance line. Which effectively means Apple broke its 2 month long bear channel today. On the other hand with that iphone news apple went on a massive sell off and closed back under the daily 20ema after wicking through the daily 8ema. The v bottom recovery support is broken now also. Apple could go either way but with this iphone sales issue I do wonder if we see a sell off on tech tomorrow for tesla earnings and Apple earnings next week. We could be seeing a bigger miss set up and bad guidance on Apple. 

Apple also failed to breakout of its key 146.5 resistance today. Which means its still trading in that 146.5 to 138.2 channel. Favor to downside based off that rejection. If Apple retakes 149.3 at any time that would change my bias to bullish on them. 

Key support- 143.7 -&gt; 142.4 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 146.5 -&gt; 147.6 -&gt; 149.3

Similar movement on Tesla. It broke that month long bear channel finally, however, put in a pretty red candle today after rejecting 230. Interestingly enough it didn‚Äôt even have the strength to retest the true resistance at 233. I am bearish on tesla personally and even with a potential earnings beat I do have a feeling guidance will not be received well and that could lead to quite the sell off. 

Tesla v bottom is still in tact though so we will look at that key 220 support level tomorrow. 

Key support- 220 -&gt; 215 -&gt; 205

Key resistance- 224.3 -&gt; 233.6

The VIX continues to show that this current two day rally doesn‚Äôt really have full market support behind it. In order to be in belief that markets truly are going to see a bigger rally this week and next I would like to see the VIX minimally under 30 but more realistically under 28.3. however, the bull channel that takes back to August bottom has been officially broken. We do have one more support to keep an eye on though. If and when that level is taken out (Red line) then I will be more bullish biased. 

This VIX candle is setting up pretty similarly to the October 5th candle also. I do still personally believe a VIX bounce is coming and that SPY will leg back down to the 350s. 

I am keeping in mind that FOMC is on November 2nd and with this media craze of fed pivot in December (which im 100% sure JPOW will remind us is NOT going to happen‚Ä¶) I could see a case where we are bullish/ range bounce until FOMC. FOMC besides earnings next week (when most big companies present) there really isn‚Äôt anything major news wise to push markets one way or another right now. 

10% challenge-

Unfortunately had to miss the opening 45 minutes cause of the dentist today but was able to have a pretty nice day. Took a few Ls on some bad bounces today and closes some plays to only watch my potential profits double if not triple‚Ä¶ but overall a great day. 

Even though it sucks to watch my 20% win go to 60% a few minutes later and sucks even more watching my -20% stop loss hit only for in 5 minutes that play to go back green‚Ä¶ I have found that I HAVE to be mechanical in this market. Too many times in the past I have said no that‚Äôs a bad bounce let me hold. It will come back for sure‚Ä¶ only to watch my $2k position which at 20% stop loss is about $400 turn into a -$2000 loss because I thought I was smarter then the charts and smarter than SPY. 

A $400 loss (-20% stop loss) is only two 10% wins to recover. That‚Äôs pretty easy to accomplish in this market especially when im paying 8-10 plays/ day lately and averaging a 80%+ win rate. 

However, a -$2000 loss is ten 10% wins (assuming I can manage ten perfect wins in a row). Now that takes a little bit more effort to accomplish. And not only that it takes me 10 wins to get back to break even vs. the other that takes me 2 wins.. that means in the same 10 wins I could have made $1600 profits if I just used a stop loss. 

Stop losses are so important and are overlooked by so many people. Profits are great and so is a high win rate‚Ä¶ but if your losses over come all those wins and profits it doesn‚Äôt even matter‚Ä¶

307,1666122427,y7gtpk,1,"I am a video editor that finished 190 episodes of television and 2,000+ commercials. I have used Avid, Premire, Final Touch (which evenyually became Apple Color and was incorporated into Final Cut X) and DaVinci Resolve.

What if we were to buy Avid (like a [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) leveraged buyout) and we could make it open sourced and move it into the future?

Here is the idea...

We set up a DAO similar to [r/BanklessDAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/BanklessDAO/) the purpose of which is to buy a controling stake in Avid. [Avid](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVID?p=AVID&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) is a public company worth about $1.06 billion by market capitalization. The money could be used to buy stock in Avid that would be owned by the DAO. A [similar organization](https://www.constitutiondao.com/) was put together [to buy a copy of the US constitution](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/what-is-a-dao-cryptocurrency-group/).

After buying 51% of the stock the DOA could vote on what technology changes Avid had to make on an organizational level by exercising voting rights as shareholders. The most important change to Avid would be to make it open source so code writers accross the world could work to make it better. The other change I would probably make is to vote to take Avid private so that Wall Street cannot take away what we collectively have created.

I know lots of editors in the Los Angeles area. We could get support by working with user groups in major cities.

Anyone interested?",What if we could collectively buy Avid and over time make it open source?,1.0,2022-10-18 19:47:07

We also just EOD had another phantom range hit the books. I have never ever seen this many phantom ranges hit the books like this before. I really don‚Äôt know how to take these. At first it was a guaranteed hit but now we are seeing that not really the case. We still have the untouched/ fill phantom print from October 7th at 373.29.

Spy currently is trading within that grey sideways channel which is 356.5 to 378.2 with the main price action happening between 356.5 and 368.7. I believe which ever one of these breaks first will be the way we push. Todays price action actually looked extremely similar to October 3rd and 4th. 

What we saw today was VOLD green pretty much 98% of the day (a handful of red candles) and in extreme bull momentum all day but SPY didn‚Äôt push up with it. Spy held the same about $2 range from 1145am till EOD.

We have two different downward channels a red one and a black one. We also are forming a falling wedge with the red bear channel support and black bear channel resistance. 

Overall im bearish under 368.6 with VIX over 31. If those conditions change tomorrow I may start looking for some upside. We are hitting earnings right now with a few decent names this week but most next week. That will be interesting to see how those play out in the market. 

Key support- 364 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.4

Futes is in an overall downward channel that‚Äôs black and blue. Currently that black and blue channels also form a falling wedge which we are holding beneath and it also lines up with the key daily 20ema resistance line. 

The biggest bullish thing for today depending on where futes close is that they are holding over and will close over 3680 resistance. Key resistance is that black resistance at 3695 for tomorrow.

Apple has a nice blue falling wedge forming and actually is holding its sideways channel of 138 to 142.4. I will be looking at the falling wedge and key levels of that channel before I decide which way markets going to go. For a lot of today it seemed like once again Apple looked weak while the general markets were propping everything up. 

Looking at the last 3 days of price action on Apple it actually does appear to be forming a daily bear flag.

Tesla is one that I struggle with. So looking at its chart Friday we had a massive full on bearishly engulfing candle. That SHOULD have led to further downside on Tesla today. However, it put in a pretty massive green inside day. The thoughts would be this was a relief bounce that did reject the daily 8ema and still is holding under black bear channel resistance. With earnings this week we could see Tesla move outside of the technical.

Despite all these media narrative or fed pausing and bullish rally to SPX 4000‚Ä¶ until the VIX breaks through this bull channel its in which is bounced off support of today I will not be playing calls. Will be watching the VIX closely this week for a break down in order to flip long. 

Key level tomorrow is 31.1. we are still trading in the orange 28.4 to 33 channel which also is a bigger indication of where we could be headed next.

313,1665988459,y63m6h,1,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/19/recession-economy-markets/

The U.S. economy could be heading for a recession in the next year, according to growing warnings from banks and economists, as a sudden bout of pessimism hammers financial markets, which on Thursday spiraled further from recent highs.

Although major swaths of the economy ‚Äî including the job market and consumer spending ‚Äî remain robust, there are mounting worries that rising borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, after years of near-zero interest rates, could cause a sudden retrenchment. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points so far this year, while officials are signaling more aggressive increases could be necessary to cool the economy. Continued uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine are adding to the uneasiness.

Financial markets fell again on Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst drop of the year. The S&amp;P 500 inched further into bear market territory ‚Äî defined as a 20 percent drop from the most recent peak ‚Äî after Wednesday‚Äôs sell-off wiped out more than 4 percent of its value.

‚ÄúRecession risks are high ‚Äî uncomfortably high ‚Äî and rising,‚Äù said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics. ‚ÄúFor the economy to navigate through without suffering a downturn, we need some very deft policymaking from the Fed and a bit of luck.‚Äù

Nations move to tackle inflation, increasing risk to global economy

This week alone, former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein warned of a ‚Äúvery, very high risk‚Äù of recession; Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said there was ‚Äúno question‚Äù that the U.S. economy is heading toward a downturn; and former Fed chair Ben Bernanke cautioned that the country could be poised for ‚Äústagflation‚Äù ‚Äî a slowing economy combined with high inflation.

Those concerns come amid a smattering of data that points to economic cooling, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors that are already feeling the brunt of the Fed‚Äôs promise to keep tightening monetary conditions. New home construction slowed in April. Mortgage demand continues to decline.

Some of the country‚Äôs largest and most influential retailers reported disappointing sales and profits this week because of higher costs and overstocked inventory issues, engineered to avoid supply chain disruptions, setting off a stock market meltdown. Walmart stock plunged more than 11 percent on Tuesday, its worst one-day loss in 35 years. On Wednesday, Target shares tumbled 26 percent, following a stunning 52 percent drop in quarterly profits, which executives attributed in part to cooling demand for big-ticket items such as TVs, kitchen appliances and outdoor furniture.

Fed hikes rates by half a percentage point in fight against inflation

‚ÄúWhile we anticipated a post-stimulus slowdown in these categories ‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt anticipate the magnitude of that shift,‚Äù Brian Cornell, Target‚Äôs chief executive, said in a Wednesday earnings call. ‚ÄúWhen we talk to our guests, they often express their concerns about a host of rapidly changing conditions, ranging from geopolitics to the high and persistent inflation they‚Äôve been experiencing.‚Äù

Goldman Sachs this week revised down its forecast for second-quarter U.S. economic growth, to an annualized rate of 2.5 percent, citing higher prices and continued supply chain disruptions. That follows an unexpected contraction in the first three months of 2022, when the economy shrank at a 1.4 percent pace, mostly because of a trade imbalance and a drop in inventory purchases.

Economy shrinks 1.4% in first 3 months of year, raising recession fear

International turmoil, including a risk of recession in Europe and China, is dimming the outlook for the U.S. economy. And a strengthening U.S. dollar ‚Äî as rate increases make dollar investments more attractive ‚Äî could dampen exports, raising the chances of a technical recession in which the economy contracts for two quarters in a row.

That fear of a souring economy as well as shifts in consumer pandemic spending habits have led some highflying tech darlings including Netflix and Peloton to announce layoffs in recent weeks. Twitter and Meta have paused hiring plans, while Amazon executives recently said the company was ‚Äúoverstaffed‚Äù after months of brisk hiring. National claims for unemployment insurance inched up to 218,000 last week, a four-month high although still near historic lows.

Meanwhile, inflation, which remains near 40-year highs, has become a central challenge for both the economy and the Biden administration. Higher prices for basics like food, energy and housing are straining Americans‚Äô budgets and clouding their view of the economy. Gas prices soared to yet another all-time high this week, with average prices hitting $4.57 per gallon nationwide. A closely watched consumer sentiment index by the University of Michigan shows that Americans‚Äô views of their current finances and future expectations have fallen sharply in the past year.

Despite that gloomy outlook, Americans continue to spend heartily. Sales of clothing, cars and furniture all ticked up in April, contributing to a 0.9 percent increase in overall retail sales from a month earlier, according to Commerce Department data released this week.

‚ÄúNear term, the U.S. economy is holding up rather well despite the trouble abroad and the high prices at the checkout stand,‚Äù said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist for S&amp;P Global, who says there‚Äôs a 35 percent risk of recession in the next year. ‚ÄúPeople are spending, businesses are still trying to hire. But there are certainly challenges ahead. The Fed‚Äôs actions will slow the economy, but the question is whether they could also topple the apple cart.‚Äù

A day after warning that slower growth and inflation are ‚Äúhaving stagflationary effects,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said Thursday she is optimistic the central bank could contain inflation without causing a recession. But she acknowledged that the ability to do so was far from clear.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs conceivable there could be a soft landing. It requires both skill and luck ‚Ä¶ I hope that‚Äôs the case, but this is a very difficult economic situation,‚Äù Yellen told reporters in Germany, citing economic shocks from the war and sanctions on Russia. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot going on. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not a straightforward matter.‚Äù

Even if the United States staves off a recession in the short term, some economists say the sheer pace of inflation, with prices up 8.3 percent in the past year, and the persistent supply-and-demand imbalances caused by the pandemic, and the policy responses to it, could snowball into an even more severe crisis down the line.

‚ÄúConsumers are spending like crazy, businesses are going to need to rebuild their inventories, and a lot of workers are still flowing back into the labor market,‚Äù said Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University who served as an adviser during the Obama administration. ‚ÄúBut all of this makes me worry about one or two or three years from now ‚Äî because it might mean the Fed needs to raise rates even more, and it might mean you create an even bigger recession later.‚Äù

Zandi, of Moody‚Äôs, said rising gas and commodity prices from pandemic-related supply chain snarls and the conflict in Ukraine have added to the specter of an economic downturn. He now puts the odds of a U.S. recession in the next 24 months at about 50 percent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre traveling very close to the edge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe housing market is the next thing that‚Äôs going to roll over; the question is just how hard.‚Äù

New home construction fell in April, led by a slowdown in single-family homes. Building permits, which offer a glimpse into future construction, also declined, according to data released this week by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

‚ÄúHome builder sentiment fell to the lowest level in two years in May,‚Äù Yelena Maleyev, an economist for Grant Thornton, said in an analyst note. ‚ÄúBuilders are seeing less foot traffic and expect sales to be softer as we enter the busy home-buying season.‚Äù

Mortgage rates are rising, but the hot housing market is slow to cool

That softening is already rippling through the economy. Major mortgage lenders across the country, including Wells Fargo and Better.com, have laid off thousands in recent weeks as a result of dwindling demand for home loans and refinancing.

In Alexandria, Va., mortgage lender Kevin Retcher said there is a discernible skittishness among potential home buyers. Refinances began tumbling late last year, around the time the Fed began signaling upcoming rate increases. In the months since, a combination of rising mortgage rates ‚Äî now at 5.3 percent for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage, nearly double early 2021 levels ‚Äî and sky-high home prices have begun deterring buyers, he said. At least three clients have gotten ‚Äúcold feet‚Äù and pulled out of ratified contracts in the past two weeks, he added.

‚ÄúThere is an extreme sense of nervousness out there,‚Äù said Retcher, president of First Meridian Mortgage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rare to have people win contracts and then back out, but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening.‚Äù

Other types of small businesses say they‚Äôre seeing a pullback in consumer demand, too, as customers grapple with rising costs. Aaron Mulherin, who owns a glass repair company in Marion, Iowa, said that while homeowners are continuing to pay for necessities such as fixing broken windows, they‚Äôre starting to think twice about spending on luxuries such as custom showers.

‚ÄúAverage, middle-class consumers are starting to hesitate,‚Äù Mulherin said. ‚ÄúEverything is getting more expensive, so they‚Äôre getting an estimate, then putting it off.‚Äù","U.S. may be barreling toward recession in next year, more experts say ‚ÄòRecession risks are high ‚Äî uncomfortably high ‚Äî and rising,‚Äô a leading economist says",1.0,2022-10-17 06:34:19

Key Excerpt:

AMONG THE JOURNAL‚ÄôS FINDINGS:   

* While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon. com Inc. 
* More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.
* More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.
* At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies. 
* About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.  
* When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency‚Äôs work.",WSJ: Government Officials Invest in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,1.0,2022-10-11 15:15:18

I had mentioned two important things last week that I wanted to watch. The red sideways channel from 362.8 to 378.2 and the red diamond support line at 362.8 Well we officially broke through both of those and now have a full candle closed below the daily 8ema. I think its fairly safe to say that markets are starting to realize once again the fed is not going to pivot and CPI is about to be a huge miss. 

361 looked like up until the last minute or so that it was going to hold. However with a failure to break a new LOY and that pretty impressive rally out of the 357s I am seeing some upside potential for tomorrow at least. With a hanging man candle closure on the daily we should look for a reversal up. I am looking for 362.8 resistance to be retested tomorrow. If bulls can retake that we should be looking for 366.7 to 370.7 as a closure. 

Historically FOMC minutes opens red and closes relatively fall (Wednesday) so from there we should see a fairly flat week going into CPI somewhere around that 366 to 373 range. 

Key support- 357.1 -&gt; 352.4

Key resistance- 361 -&gt; 362.8 -&gt; 366.7 -&gt; 370.5

Futures showing the same breakdown as SPY today. Overall that doji candle closure after bouncing off key 3600 support should provide some upside relief tomorrow and possibly Wednesday before CPI. 

Key support- 3600 -&gt; 3545

Key resistance- 3650 -&gt; 3705 -&gt; 3745

Apple held its red sideways channel today and actually managed to close out a green day. With the same doji formed on apple along with holding key 140 support I expect a push for the gap fill of 147.54 before CPI on Thursday. 

If we lose 138.2 at any point I would be pretty comfortable in some puts for a bigger breakdown and a test of Apples 52week low. 

Today for most of the day Apple looked very strong but was constantly being held down by SPY. 

Key support- 140 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 141.3 -&gt; 142.5-&gt; 144

Despite Tesla closing its 4th red day in a row, and 7th out of the last 8 trading days red‚Ä¶ I actually see a lot of strength in Tesla. I am seeing a nice 223 double bottom form on both the daily and weekly charts. Tesla with the doji I will be looking for that 8 day long red resistance line to be broken finally. That resistance lies at 221.3 tomorrow. Failure to break through that resistance would lead to downside and a bigger support test near 212.9.

I am bullish for tomorrow based on Apple and Tesla. I think we see a small relief bounce before CPI prints on Thursday. Key resistance of a break of the red channel lies at 240 on Wednesday. 

I also believe IF CPI does print badly that Tesla puts are going to be a great play. I believe looking at the weekly that tesla could see as low as 178 before next weeks earnings hit and likely boosts it back up. Of course a miss on tesla earnings and its gonna be really scary.

The VIX is very interesting to watch right now. Seemingly there was no major news that should have caused the vix to reach 34 today. However, once it did reach 34 we saw a pretty massive unwind of it there which saved SPY from a new 52week low. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sden689bg1t91.png?width=455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=809e47bbb6eca1d44efbb3458e830a8c38e2e7ce

I am curious if we are going to see the VIX sitting closer to 33 to 34 this time. The one thing that helps the VIX is that the FOMC minutes release the day before CPI and that should cause a nice unwinding of the VIX historically. 

However, I am seeing the ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù setup happening before our eyes‚Ä¶ As long as the VIX holds near 32-35 before market closes on Wednesday AND cpi is a huge miss we should see the VIX break 40+ on Thursday. 

Septembers CPI saw the VIX spike 15%... usually we see a 15-20% spike on the VIX, however, it often unwinds by EOD‚Ä¶ if we want to see the VIX break 40 we need to be at atleast 33-35 at market close on Wednesday night. 

Why is the VIX over 40 important? Well once we see that that is usually the sign of capitulation. Most people say VIX 40-60 is true capitulation signs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I wont be here EOW to post any TA on this I wanted to add my weekly chart and what I am looking at. I am looking at SPY to most likely hold somewhere from 360-370 by Wednesday at market close. Assuming that CPI is a miss (which if you read my CPI post you see I am expecting this) and we are going to see VIX 40+ by EOW and I believe SPY could see 338 EOW. That‚Äôs about a 9% drop from 370‚Ä¶ If we get a CPI miss and don‚Äôt see 338 this week I believe we bounce near 328 to 335 the following week. 

10% challenge- 

Today was a pretty great day‚Ä¶ most of the gains came form the opening hour. Again price action is horrible to trade and we are seeing positions go green and then immediately rip red. This still remains a scalpers paradise and remains a quick and frequent profit market. This is not the market to be greedy in.

328,1665405911,y0dw35,1," Why does volatility increase if liquidity decreases? 

As you know by now, the Fed is reducing liquidity on the market by raising interest rates and reducing the balance sheet and denying many people and businesses access to credit. An important component of volatility is the market cap. For example, if a company has a market cap of 100M, the movement of 50M is sufficient to significantly increase or decrease the stock. If, on the other hand, we want to move the price of a company with 1000 billion market caps, 500 billion will be needed to generate the same movement.

 You can therefore pump companies like [$GME (GameStop Corp.)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/gme) but not like [$AAPL (Apple)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/aapl) 

The companies' market caps have shrunk dramatically this year. 

This means that far less money is needed to move the major indices both down and up. 

In fact, it is much more frequent to see collapses and rises of more than 3% in a single day.

 In the chart below ([$SPX500](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/spx500) daily) you can see the difference between 2021 and 2022. Look at the size of the candles and the fluctuations of 2022 compared to those of 2021.

TSM Earnings
Earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor are due Thursday before open. TSM stock is down sharply, more than 50% off its high as of Friday's close, after a breakout attempt from a shallow cup base in January quickly failed.

TSM stock slumped 6% Friday despite reporting better-than-expected September sales.

Sellers have hit the stock hard despite several quarters in a row of robust earnings and revenue growth.

For the third quarter, profit is seen surging 56% to $1.69 share, with revenue up 40% to $20.83 billion.

The company has some high-profile customers, including Apple (AAPL), which accounted for about 25% of revenue in 2021. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) are also big customers.

333,1665242200,xyva3q,1,"Well I took the day off today and missed an absolutely banger of a day it looks like. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7n3vm2r8mls91.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f3168133d679793971b83d9f5b4953b9e9408ec

Lets start with the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù SPY fell 2.79% Friday and then lets talk about it a little bit more. Last week well really Monday we saw a massive media pivot (punny haha) where all of a sudden they went from the doom and gloom to ‚Äúmost likely the fed will pause rate hikes after this November meeting.‚Äù It was kind of a really odd change of pace for the media as anyone with more then 2 brain cells pretty much understands that the fed is already way behind on these rate hikes and that the biggest mistake the fed could make right now is decreasing their rate hikes too fast or too soon. Que the Volker era mistakes. JPOW himself has been pretty clear that he is not going to stop rate hikes until 2024 most likely. 

So lets talk about Friday‚Ä¶ we finally had a data drop that was ‚Äúbig‚Äù enough to effect the markets. We have been having jobless claims like usually and the last one actually showed a slight increase in jobless claims but unemployment decreased. Good for America right? Well no the FED is going to continue to be aggressive and increase rate hikes until inflation is down and pretty much till the economy takes a big hit. Without saying it the ideal unemployment rates near 8-10% for them. With a STRONG work force and STRONG economy Feds have a lot more room to be hawkish. 

This explains to me why we had a red open, however, it seems liked a bit of a over reaction in my opinion. But that brings me to my next ‚Äúwhy‚Äù did Friday close so red. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfdraz49mls91.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2233d9273791bd6c640388732f5320169b03c3

Last Tuesday I mentioned the ‚Äúphantom print‚Äù that hit the tapes. Now there is a lot of speculation about what these prints mean or why they are happening. Well we finally came down and touched 366.57 today. Only took 3 days this time, however, the last few times these prints have hit the day of or the next day the phantom print has been hit. 

Well lets fast forward to Friday and take a look at our range. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e5or73k9mls91.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cd3d3b933679a3233063dae2b2d1a18c30c8753

There it is‚Ä¶ yet another phantom print hitting the tapes and effecting the daily range. Fridays TRUE high of day was 369.37 while the brokers are showing 373.29 as are true range. Why are these phantom prints such a big deal? Well from a logistical stand point it shows that the darkpool orders are really active behind the scenes right now. Someone is doing some massive buy and sells behind closed doors and are literally moving the markets with them. On the other hand from a technical stand point these phantom prints make the daily candles look completely different then what they are supposed to look like and effect patterns and algos and everything else. 

So where are we at not? Whats next for SPY? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c78dc79amls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8168bbafbf70e043eeee74b5d1c0da400846378b

I mentioned Thursday it looked like we were repeating the June tight consolidation before a major breakdown but now it appears we are repeating the June 21st to July 29th range trading of 372.5 to 390.2, however, this time our range is 362.8 to 378.3. As you can see even with the big dump today we bounced pretty aggressively off 360.94 and closed right at that key 362.79 support level. 

Now this is where the phantom print really messes with stuff‚Ä¶ On one hand we have this massive $12.35 phantom candle when in reality its closed to a $8 candle range. With the phantom candle we have a wick over the daily 8ema, however, with the true candle we would have just closed a candle below the daily 8ema completely. The other thing is using the phantom candle we have the less aggressive black falling wedge with a resistance of 368.3 for Monday, however, the true candle uses that red dotted falling wedge which gives a resistance of 361.3 for Monday. They tell very different stories. 

The biggest story I am seeing and ill look to see how it plays out this week is that 362.8 to 378.3 range. Again as I said last week there are vey few reasons to go long here until after CPI on Thursday. Once that data drops good or bad we should have a pretty good sense of where we are headed for the next month. 

The more I look at SPY the more I see we actually are forming another massive diamond breakout pattern. Key diamond support for Monday is 361.9 and diamond resistance is 376.4. I will be watching this pattern closely next week for a hint of where we should see the next few weeks of trading take us. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ydqs0yamls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da653b35c9173b7b12a10f62d1f4c22efb94602

Taking a look at the weekly chart this is where I become more bearish then bullish. We after putting in one hell of a good fight to trade over the weekly 200ema for most of the week got wrecked on Friday and that led us to close back below the weekly 200ema. With this massively long wicked gravestone doji on a down trend I would expect further downside. Usually a gravestone doji on a down trend would lead to further downside instead of more upside. However, with a FOMC minutes Wednesday and CPI Thursday (look for the trade analysis of this in the server later today or tomorrow) we are going to see another week where the technical don‚Äôt matter. 

SPY is maintaining the highly aggressive black bear channel down and now also has an even more aggressive red dotted resistance line too. With a nice weekly 8ema breakout rejection. A lot of the signs of this weekly point to bearish. 

There is hints of a small V bottom forming as you can see but I am unsure if that plays out or not this week. The biggest thing I am seeing in the event of bad news from FOMC and CPI is that we could see a support bounce near 338 this week. This is the support form the covid crash. Spy would essentially be erasing 2 years of movement up if we retrace to that level. 

Key support- 362.1 (weekly v bottom) -&gt; 357 -&gt; 350.4 -&gt; 338 -&gt; 331.8

Key resistance- 366.6 -&gt; 369.1 (red dotted resistance) -&gt; 376.4 (black bear channel resistance) 

&amp;#x200B;

Futures (I cleaned chart so you can see it better) has the same diamond pattern forming too. Key support for Monday is 3650 and key resistance is 3780. We are seeing the same similar pattern here on Futures where we are set in a bigger consolidation range of 3650 to 3805. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a8lranybmls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a3d6f58ee81db287b3869caa13384f177778b3d

Futures weekly looks similar but has a much bigger bodied gravestone doji. It almost looks like a hammer candle which could result in a reversal but with a small wick to the downside its classified as a doji. With that massive weekly 8ema rejection and red dotted resistance falling wedge inside the bear channel it does appear set up for further downside this week. 

Note we failed just barely to touch the jpm collar of 3870 and will look at the first set of puts at 3425 if we break down. 

Key support- 3590 -&gt; 3530 -&gt; 3470 -&gt; 3415 (black bear channel support) -&gt; 3395 (green bear channel support)

Key resistance- 3705 (red dotted resistance falling wedge) -&gt; 3855 (black bear channel) 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1nd5o0gcmls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f03641ca2fc6945e46b9fda55381a1f7feaf5be

Highlighted in blue this time we once again have another diamond pattern formed on Apple. This times its quite a wide diamond pattern as opposed to the last one we saw back around the beginning to middle of September. Remember when that support broke on the diamond we saw the big downside push we have now play out. 

The only regret I have trading this week is not holding my apple puts. I was 100% correct in expecting that the 146.5 triple top with gravestone doji rejection of the blue bear channel resistance and closing back under the daily 8ema would lead to further downside. However, I closed my puts for breakeven because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be trading yesterday (Friday) and would be able to manage the position. In the end no dollars lost so its find but I do wish I would have held those. 

Anyways that played out and now we are seeing the diamond pattern and this massive resistance line play out. Apple is set up for a decently green Monday unless bears come out swinging on Monday. Unless apple opens below 138.8 (-1%) and holds that all day we will see that black resistance line (through the diamond) broken to the upside which should lead to a much back to test 142.4 and possibly 144.1. Apple now has a gap to fill all the way up to 147.54 which I do expect to be in play early next week. 

Key support will be that blue diamond support at 140 and resistance at 145.9.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjpswxbdmls91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21ac2335bd208f3e2ce4d732ad645d24de36f5f8

Apples weekly is actually one of the more bullish charts I have seen out here. Especially before Fridays massive dump Apple was putting in a really tight double bottom with a massive push up. However, the way this candle finished as a weekly 8ema rejection with a double bottom at 138.1 with a gravestone doji. Again very similar to a long bodied hammer candle which as a double bottom would lead to a huge push up, however, the gravestone doji becomes the wild card. 

Looking at the last month on Apple we are seeing quite the bit of dejavu honestly. Apple does look poised for an early week bounce. 

Key support- 138.2 -&gt; 133.4 -&gt; 129.1

Key resistance- 141.7 -&gt; 145.5 (blue bear channel resistance) -&gt; 149.3

Tesla is the stock that just cant seem to catch a break. Every time it looks like it could bounce or could see a small push up it catches a bad break from the market. Earlier in the week when SPY and the rest of the market went on a massive run Tesla got stomped because of the delivery numbers and then it also got stomped because of the twitter deal. Now we are seeing the inverse head and shoulders pattern hopefully played out. I do believe that Tesla is due (way overdue) for a bounce but there is a chance it continues to drill a little lower before we find that support. 

Tesla is impressively red 6 of the last 7 days now and in the last 3 weeks has fallen a total of 29.3% in 3 weeks. Tesla is also now only 6.9% off of its 52 week low. My thoughts on tesla is that IF CPI comes in good tesla is finally going to put the boosters on and will be the best call position. However, if CPI is bad I think tesla will easily break into the 100s and will be a great short position. 

I am still looking for a small recovery bounce on Tesla early this week.

Weekly timeframe wise we are seeing that the June recovery support line has finally been broken‚Ä¶ remember this is the support line that many stocks (Spy and apple included) broke over a month ago. The toughest part of Tesla right here is that on one hand its down 30% in 3 weeks and it seems like FOMO chasing more puts on it‚Ä¶ however, it clearly has not bounced and does not appear to want to bounce even when given every opportunity to bounce. 

The biggest bullish case I am seeing formed on Tesla right now is that it is forming a potential 222 double bottom off previous support. If Monday holds this 222 level there is a pretty good play on calls (especially if SPY and Apple start to bounce green). However, if we lose that 222 level I am looking for a bigger retrace to 207 and possibly all the way down to 178. The weekly 200ema which has not been touched since October 2019 sits at 186.3. 

Key support- 222 -&gt; 207 -&gt; 186.3

Key resistance- 238.9 (blue resistance) -&gt; 255

Overall the VIX is still in a pretty clear upward channel right now. The vix remains stuck over 28.4 however is failing to break through and hold over 33. The one thing I am seeing is that this looked like a nice revert to mean move up on the VIX back to is previous 6 days trading period average of 31.6. 

With FOMC minutes and CPI next week I do wonder if they will attempt to artificially unwind the vix some next week. Having the VIX near 32 before FOMC minutes and CPI is a disaster waiting to happen and very well COULD result in the VIX breaking 40+ and full on capitulation that we all have been waiting for and the markets have ‚Äúfeared.‚Äù

I will talk about this more detailed in my CPI write up and FOMC write up but I think we are setting up for a choppy to green early beginning of the week with a pretty massive break down Wednesday to Friday. 

I will be looking at for a pretty big CPI miss this time. CORE forecast is already set to be 0.2 to 0.1% higher then previous (with their consensus/ forecast being 0.2% +/-) so we really could be looking at anywhere from 6.3% (no change aka bearish) to 6.7% (big miss real bearish) and actual CPI while it has now come down 2 CPI in a row the consensus and forecast is HIGHER then the previous (with the same 0.2% +/-) we can expect a CPI of 7.8% to 8.3%. Note we have had as much as 0.3% of a difference in consensus and actual. So we could be seeing 7.7% to 8.4%.

If CPI comes in a 7.7-7.8% BUT core once again misses markets are gonna dump hard due to KNOWING fed can no pivot, however, if CPI comes in higher and CORE drops markets are likely to dump either way. The ONLY way I see markets rallying on Thursdays CPI numbers is if the CORE and CPI both drop‚Ä¶ that would mean by some miracle the consensus of CPI and CORE CPI were incorrect. In my opinion odds of a big green CPI Thursday are low. 

10% challenge-

Overall this was an amazing week for me. I had a big benefit from playing some overnight swings (longer DTE) and picking the correction direction. I didn‚Äôt trade Friday due to family stuff but overall turned in an amazing week.

Someone recently asked me why, a 34 year old with a solid career and pension invests in such ‚Äúboomer‚Äù or ‚Äúuninteresting‚Äù stocks such as Apple, Microsoft and or Home Depot. 

My reasoning, tipping. Yes. The act of paying a server an amount of bringing you your food and making sure your beer glass never goes empty. 

I went for dinner tonight at a local restaurant. The bill was $72. My wife and I both had a flight of beer (4 beers at 5oz each), and I had the chicken burger and fries and she had the fish tacos and fries. Beyond inflationary reasons, $72 total which included tax. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about that tax. In the province I live in, the food bill is subject to 5% tax. The liquor is also subject to 10%. 

So the actual food bill wasn‚Äôt $72. It was actually closer to $62. And then you throw the taxes on there and you get $72. 

Now. The moment you‚Äôve all been waiting for. Tipping. 

We tip on the total amount. That‚Äôs right, on the full $72, even though almost 10% is just tax. And. Of course the restaurant had a minimum tax amount of 18%. 

Now, how does all this relate to the stock market? Because just like food, tax, tipping, that new IPhone is going to cost more money in 5 years because we as the consumer are paying more now in situations like these. 

If Apple sees that the world is making more money (and I‚Äôm using the server as the comparable to the world in case you crayon eating dumb dumbs can‚Äôt follow along), then they are going to charge more for their product.",How Tipping Drives The Economy,1.0,2022-10-07 03:29:26

Well if you were looking for further clarification on where we could go next you are going to have to keep waiting. 

Today was yet again another range day except this one was even more dramatic and even more choppy. Had a pretty weak morning that quickly turned into untradeable chop that found extreme weakness end of day. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lg7v8f5i0as91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=add419276db2a4a75bb47f686ac630255542778b

What I am seeing develop is a bull flag which could lead to upside potential, however, we are definitely going to need to see 378 broken and a clear move up over that daily 20ema. On the other hand I am seeing a soft rejection of the black bear channel, a rejection of the daily 20ema for the 3rd day in a row and a triple top at 378. We are pretty much stuck between 372.4 and 378 right now. With 370.6 being key support and clearly 378 being key resistance right now the risk to reward of playing anything right now especially with the looming CPI next Wednesday (4 trading days away) there is little risk to reward to swinging anything right now. 

Historically leading into CPI we saw a pretty hefty sell off, however, the last CPI we actually had a really impressive rally which was then immediately stopped out and led to a massive sell off after the big CPI Core miss. We most likely are going to see a lot of consolidation over the next 3 trading days as markets are unsure what to expect from CPI. 

On one hand any logical person knows that JPOW is not going to pivot or pause rate hikes in November like the markets appear to be ‚Äúbelieving‚Äù right now, however, if we get a decrease in CPI and especially Core CPI next Wednesday that could be a big bullish push for markets. Remember even if its not rational markets can rally off it‚Ä¶ just look at last julys rally, the BOE news rally, and this current rally based on another fake pivot move‚Ä¶ however, on the other hand if we get a bad CPI and especially a bad core CPI we are going to see a pretty big move down and possibly put a new 52week low in as markets panic. 

Tomorrow going into next week is pretty simple. A close below 372.4 and especially under 370.6 supports I am bearish going into next week and would expect a 2 day selloff going into CPI like we have historically seen. However, a break of 378 resistance and we are going to be looking at a calls with another green push into CPI like last time. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z1dvj2ui0as91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f934815db2434f7fc8b47665c6377661708cc3d9

I removed some of my arrows to show the blue arrow pattern a little better but I mentioned this last week and its actually playing out even better now with the 372 to 378 chop. What ive we are actually recreating the march to may drop‚Ä¶ may to June pop and consolidation before the huge June dump? 

The pattern is literally identical which would mean we start chopping here till next week. For June we saw the two days before CPI lead to the massive dump, however, its possible we just chop in this 370 to 378 range and then maybe we do get another bad CPI/ Core CPI and markets go into another week to two week sell off and we retest the 2022 bear market support. 320 would be the June 2020 resistance/ September 2020 support and 330 would be the November 2020 support and 337 would be the feb 2020 resistance.

My thoughts for the end of the week and especially Monday and Tuesday next week is that we are going to see quite a bit of chop. The markets could react negatively or positively to the unemployment data tomorrow morning but much like we saw this morning its unlikely to matter much. 

My thoughts remain that as long as SPY is holding between 370 and 380 we are in consolidation. This pattern has played out numerous times before the next move‚Ä¶ August 31st to sept 8th, July 29th to August 9th, May 27th to June 8th, April 25th to May 5th, April 11th to April 21st, March 7th to March 15th, etc. etc. What is the other common denominator for these consolidation periods? They mostly are ended by an external event like CPI, FOMC, FOMC minutes, big fed days, etc. etc. It would make a lot of sense for the market to hold here before we head into the next big fed fuel move. If you think about it the markets do not want to be over extended one way or another before this meeting. And really even if markets are rallying on a false premise big money isn‚Äôt going to step in on hopes and dreams like retail will. 

The other key factor here is that the DMI Stochastic is hella overbought (just like last CPI). If we maintain these levels going into the next CPI with the stochs over bought like they were last time I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the next leg down. 

I would actually like to hear peoples inputs about what they expect the next CPI to be and more specifically what they expect CORE CPI to be‚Ä¶

While I expect chop the thing that would completely negate this pattern is if we close a candle (daily candle body) under 370 or we close a candle (Daily candle body) over 380. That would in my opinion be our hint at the next move up. Or down. Historically speaking though we should see a move down. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z8tr1sqj0as91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=218734365836794a796ccf08d1ba0cf36eca36f8

Looking at futures you can see we have a nice falling wedge with that blue support line and the black resistance line. We are kinda out here in no mans land flirting with the 50% retracement line. Major resistance of the overall downward trend since August is up around 3950 and projected support is down closer to 3450. We are stuck in the middle. We are seeing that 3805 remains a level of stout resistance for futures both intraday and afterhours. I will be watching that closely and watching support at 3690 closely.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ml5segk0as91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee465357a4110aeaad34e9b626eb4cd1281110b

Apple I will say has one of the more clear in my opinion bearish setups. However, I am not convinced momentum or volume is going to let that play out. You can see the DMI stoch is hitting overbought territory finally here which does also play into not only an apple but an overall market downward move pending. 

What I am seeing on Apple is a soft blue bear channel resistance breakout test rejection along with a triple top at 146.5 with a gravestone doji. Sound really bearish? Well it is. But again with the CPI print next week we start to run into this is what it should do but markets are going to do what they want to do till that print is out. I actually had opened some Apple puts today 8dte to hold when I saw that 146.5 was rejecting and that the gravestone doji was forming. Well I actually initially bought calls and called that out on accident then was thankfully asked if that was what I meant to buy and sold then for a whole $1. I held the calls most of the day and oddly enough for them being 8dte and being ATM they got theta ate up bad. At the LOD (I bought then when Apple was around $146 and even at the LOD I was just barely able to sell them for breakeven. I ended up selling then before the 330pm pop at breakeven in the pickup line for my kiddos school).

I don‚Äôt know about you guys but I feel like Apple options are not paying out very well lately. I held some puts yesterday and ran into a similar situation where the reward for the move that happened didn‚Äôt seem to properly correlate. 

Anyways if I didn‚Äôt have to take the day off tomorrow the risk to reward to hold the Apple puts would have been there but I know I wont be able to manage the position and didn‚Äôt wanna hold a blind 0dte position. 

Much like SPY we are seeing a key consolidation zone being built of 142.5 support and 147.6 resistance. Further rejections of 147.6 resistance would lead me to a bearish mindset and further support bounces at 142.5 would make me believe in consolidation. If that blue resistance line is broken tomorrow (resistance at 146.9) then we just might see a bigger move up next week before CPI. Again we are approaching a fed even (CPI) where technical are going to play funny. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lncwmk0l0as91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49bd65d939d766accf43f4fab89a4771af3b50b4

Yesterday I had mentioned I was bullish on Tesla and I had expected us to see a bounce higher. Well I was half right. I was right enough for the option to play but I was not right enough for Tesla to close green. I wish I would have opened puts when I saw the sell off developing. Tesla has now put in 5 of the last 6 days red. Today ended up being an inside day for tesla (maintaining yesterdays range) and actually one of the lowest overall movements from low to high that tesla has seen in weeks. 

We did see an attempted retest of 245 breakout this morning that was rejected and we also once again lost 242.3 support and closed in the 230s for the first time since July 14th. This is where I am unsure of where Tesla is headed next. Technical wise I really do think that Tesla is due for a bounce and if it does bounce it will be a big one. However I am not sure if you guys caught that 1245pm pump on tesla but it got an ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù buy rating that sent it on a nice huge pump for about 2 hours however by EOD it started to sell off once again. I actually am a little surprised to see the fact that even that ‚Äúgood news‚Äù couldn‚Äôt hold tesla up. That shows there is a lot more weakness (probably thanks to the twitter dead) then the technical show. At this point tesla is in a no play zone for me or at least a tread extremely light zone. Overall I do think we see some downside on tesla due to the weakness we are seeing but it very well unless there is a news dump could get a sympathy rally with the markets. Once we do pick a direction though (overall market with CPI) I feel like tesla could be the better play IF we expect downside. With tesla still being the highest off its 52week low I would be surprised to not see tesla with the twitter situation see a new low if we get a bad CPI and markets chose to dump. 

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX is still maintaining support at that 28.4 level I mentioned I was watching closely. The VIX is actually in a consolidation period itself now. With 29.9 to 33 being its revert to mean range. I would like to see the VIX break under 28.4 before im overly bullish on this market but I would also like to see the VIX close a candle over 33 before I suspect we push for a new 52week low. 

10% challenge- 

Overall good day with low trades again. I had those nice winning tesla calls this morning and was able to do 3 really nice SPX put scalps all within the first hour of the day. Which im thankful for because from there we just pretty much chopped in that range and nothing looked really good.

Note- not included in here is my $1 winning accidental Apple calls and my closed breakeven Apple puts. 

I will be gone tomorrow with the kiddos for a school event tomorrow. I am hoping to trade the EOD but I am not sure if that‚Äôs going to happen or not. 

Also as a heads up to everyone I will be out of town Wednesday, Thursday and Friday next week. There will NOT be daily TAs posted on those days and there will NOT be a weekly TA post next week. This week there will be a TA post though! I will keep an eye on the markets and if anything looks decent I will post some swings. Tuesday night in the server ill have something post for CPI too!

Tl;dr it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs literally the goal of the whole Fed‚Äôs interest rates madness: reducing demand so businesses stop abusing price increases and inflation goes down. So businesses *actually* seeing less demand now is very much bullish (not for them though, but for the rest of the market).

344,1665001900,xwlh0o,1,"The question everyone is wondering is‚Ä¶ is the bottom in OR is this still just a convincing dead cat bounce? In my opinion the jury is still out. I am leaning with essentially an inside day on SPY but tech looking pretty strong (apple specifically) and after a very deep red open and massive recovery even going green at open point that we are going to finish this week out green and next week see a retrace in preparation for CPI. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6plwqaur1s91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28fcc4b885eae5ad97eb97897c617c70e1e94e3a

Spy had broken the previous V bottom support but now we have this v bottom support. We are looking at a pretty fat bodied doji. This should with the two day push, daily 8ema support retest and holding, 370 range support test hold and briefly breaking over 378 before closing just under it provide upside for tomorrow. This to me was a bullish day. We looked extremely doomish this morning and then the bulls stepped in and let this rally almost all day. EOD drop was most likely profit takers. 

Key resistance bulls need to conquer tomorrow is the 378 and the daily 20ema. The next major resistance that we will likely push for is 382.1 which puts us through the black bear channel and puts us in line to Friday or next week test the blue bear channel that dates back to August. As long as bulls continue to defend that 370.6 level like they did today I am biased to the upside. 

Key support- 373.5 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 366.7

Key resistance- 378 -&gt; 379.8 (black bear channel) -&gt; 382.1 -&gt; 386.4

If we look at SPY weekly you can see that there is a pretty big case that we are going to test 3985.2 resistance we also have a very convincing V bottom forming along with retaking the weekly 200ema. If the bulls can take back that weekly 8ema and close over 385.2 this week then that should provide a lot of upside for next week especially with a bullish CPI.

Futures put in quite the range from 3734 to 3820 today. Futures is currently sitting right at that key 3805 resistance. With a dragonfly doji we should expect upside here. Key v bottom support will be at 3805. With a back test of 3735 previous resistance that should provide a big support base going forward. 

Support- 3805-&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735

Resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925

Apple looked stronger then the rest of the market all day today. Even this morning when SPY and Tesla were selling off apple was very delayed in its sell off. The other actually impressive thing is that Apple daily candle closed as a bullish engulfing candle at 0.21% when yesterday was a 2.56% green day. Apple also perfectly back filled its gap which should allow for further upside movement. If bulls can retake that key 149.3 resistance that was heavy support previously that would be very bullish going forward. 

Key support- 146 -&gt; 144.2 -&gt; 141.4

Key resistance- 147.7 (blue bear channel) -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.8

My tesla pattern that I called out 2 weeks ago when it hit 312 has finally played out completely as far as I am concerned. The low average prior to the move up was 222 and the high average was 242 with 234 being the privot point. With a test and pretty impressive bounce off 233.27 today I actually am expecting quite a bit of upside for tesla eow and even next week. 

Tesla is down 18% in 5 days, 20% in 6 days and 26% in 11 days... In my opinion it is due for a bounce. I believe yesterday before the Twitter news dropped tesla actually was going for a relief bounce closer to 260. I do believe eventually this downside play needed to happen but now its happened we should be looking for upside. As long as Apple and Spy as pushing tesla should push with it. With the closing of a pretty large dragonfly doji after a massive sell off I am looking for that bounce this week on Tesla. 

Another key thing is that the 5 day long (6 tomorrow) resistance line is in play and unless tesla opens under 239.4 (-0.6%) and holds red all day then we will break that resistance and we should see further upside. There is a small amount of room for the huge falling wedge to play out one more day to the downside and test 226 support but I favor with SPY and Apple looking strong that we do bounce. However, if Apple and SPY come out weak tomorrow like today we should see the 220s hit. 

If the upside doesn‚Äôt play out intraweek I suspect it plays out next week. 

Support- 234.6 -&gt; 226.4 -&gt; 222

Resistance- 239.4 -&gt; 242.3 -&gt; 249.2 -&gt; 254.7

The VIX continues to be overall undecided on what it wants to do holding over that key 28.4 pivot level. However we saw a back test of the daily 8ema resistance which did hold and show sell off into EOD. I suspect the VIX to break under that 28.4 level tomorrow which should provide upside potential for SPY. 

10% challenge-

Another pretty killer day for me today. Most of it came from Swings though. I struggled this morning with the techicals which looking back makes sense because I was attempting to find scalps prior to the v bottom rally. Technicals this morning and early afternoon once again were out of wack but by EOD were playing nicely again.

TLDR: 900k float with options

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

It is a confusing time for our dear gay bears, the market has been producing a series of perfect little scrumptious red dildos followed by prolapse worthy green cock rockets. Unfortunately, things will soon become much more befuddling for our precious, [precious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aotlEpmAFVQ) compatriots.

As most of us are aware, for many years, Harley-Davidson ($HOG, their actual ticker ü§î) has primarily sold to the gay male demographic. We can see this clearly illustrated in this clip from the famous 2009 documentary film, ‚ÄúThe F Word‚Äù: [YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipDmsxQVxIM).Unfortunately, as we all know, times are changing. In 2019, Harley-Davidson released the LiveWire, an electric motorcycle. It was reasonably well received \[[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/business/harley-davidson-livewire.html)\] despite lacking the signature homo rumble.

Ewan McGregor rode one of these for 100 days for an Apple TV show: [Ewan McGregor rides HOG long and hard for Tim Cook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=611fw81BN98). And here I thought they were moving on from this stuff‚Ä¶ change takes time üòï

&amp;#x200B;

**LiveWire (LVWR) is born**

In any case, they decided to spin off their electric motorcycle division as LiveWire (company has the same name as the motorcycle). Thus, on September 27 of this year, LiveWire was successfully spun-off as a new company and deSPACed to begin trading as LVWR \[[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-03/harley-davidson-s-e-bike-spinoff-surges-in-volatile-trading?srnd=hyperdrive)\], valued at $500m.

&amp;#x200B;

**Low Float**

Now for the good news, because of high redemption rates on the SPAC, this stock only has 902,888 shares left in the tradable float.\*

**\***3,402,888 shares are owned by public stockholders \[[8-k](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1898795/000119312522255710/d378827dex992.htm), search ‚Äú3,402,888‚Äù\], of which 2,500,000 are owned by the CEO of the SPAC \[[8-k](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1898795/000119312522255710/d378827d8k.htm), search ‚Äú2,500,000‚Äù\]. The CEO‚Äôs (Garcia) shares are locked up until 18 months are up or when the share price is &gt;=$18 for 20 days out of any 30 trading-day period  \[[S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1898795/000119312522029818/d300799ds4.htm), search ‚ÄúLock-up period‚Äù\].

You can also see this discussed online \[[twitter post 1](https://twitter.com/SteveYonezu/status/1575962251701256193/photo/1), Yonezu Investing\] \[[twitter post 2](https://twitter.com/OddDiligence/status/1575957417690509312), Odd Diligence\].

Long story short, 900k float.

&amp;#x200B;

**Options on a low float stock**

With such a low float this can move sharply, and since LVWR has options it is very vulnerable to market maker/option seller hedging.

The options chain is loaded \[[optionistics link](https://www.optionistics.com/quotes/stock-option-chains/LVWR)\] for October‚Äôs monthly opex. Now, if we assume that option sellers will be delta hedging \[[small explainer](https://twitter.com/bennpeifert/status/1306690675245678592?lang=ar), from Benn Eifert, a legit quant\] to avoid taking a position on the underlying stock, we could see them purchasing 100 shares for every call that comes ITM.

At $10 we see 27% of the float to be hedged for, at $12.5 we potentially have option sellers buying half the shares in the float, which *might* lead to big moves and further squeezing.

**Other**

Besides that, the current CTB, as I write this (10/5/22) is 55% \[[https://imgur.com/a/sJDFjM1](https://i.imgur.com/buYVIPe.png)\] and peak CTB was 265%. Short interest is \~13.4% of float (121.8k shares short), and only 900 shares remain currently available to short.

350,1664917122,xvqiin,1,"What an interesting day that we just had today‚Ä¶ There is a lot to unpack today. The first thing I want to touch on is the daily range of SPY today. Lets take a look 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7n48fhiprur91.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1002362aaa2287d0547940f94dd8d1aef1d228f8

According to the data that brokers supply us‚Ä¶ SPY saw a range of $11.43 with a LOD of 366.57 and a HOD of 377.66, however, SPYs actual LOD is 372.31 and a range of $5.69. So what does this mean? Well the last times this happened I coined it the ‚Äúphantom range‚Äù and everytime it has happened the price of SPY has hit that level either intraday or the next day. This most likely is dark pool prints. 

Today was also extremely interesting when we look at the buy pressure, and TRIN. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zcapwwxprur91.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e5dc94bc25c3d7a7ca6e9a840e1412bbf4c1cf

Left side is todays market data which shows that we had a legit buy pressure of almost 2500:1 on SPY this morning and our trin was 0.21 (extreme imbalanced). Then we take a look at yesterday and our buy pressure on that massive run up was 9.72 and our TRIN was 5.05 (also hella imbalanced). 

This is officially the biggest two day rally that SPY has had all year and is the biggest two day rally since April 2020‚Ä¶ so what comes next? 

Well lets look at WHY the market is even rallying like this‚Ä¶ the CNBC current news cycle is set on repeat of ‚Äúthe fed is going to pivot, December is likely the last rate hike‚Ä¶‚Äù is this true? No most likely not‚Ä¶ JPOW was very clear that we would NOT see a pivot or rate pauses until 2024 most likely. But with BOE and now Austria slowing its rate hikes/ starting QE‚Ä¶ markets are rallying on this news. 

There is a chance we are about to go on a massive rally for the next 2 months till the November rate hike and JPOW finally talks again. That or we are seeing an extreme bear market dead cat bounce and the shows about to come to and end soon. Most of the bear market bounces this year are around $20 for low to high‚Ä¶ we from Fridays low at $20.96. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eoefi5fqrur91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7b12d0ed958d1707c38d02a8dc30dc7f4e8775

Okay here is the above chart with less lines to make it clear on what im trying to show‚Ä¶ We are looking like we are in a pattern just like the March to may sell off followed by an aggressive rally that led to consolidation and then a bigger dump (when CPI hit). I wonder if this pattern is about to play out again. That dump was a bounce form the 75% retracement to the 50% retracement‚Ä¶ consolidation then dump to the 2022 bear channel support (around 330-340 depending on timing). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3pl1q2xqrur91.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ce5cf94e8207fc4a517888cbb9e379cba0e4c05

Today we saw SPY with a massive gap up (however, due to the phantom print this gap is now covered) over the daily 8ema and we stopped right at the 20ema. Most of these dead cat bounces have also stopped at the daily 20ema. So we are at a major pivot point here. 

There was on the 15min chart 14 attempts to break 377.3 resistance before it finally in the last minute popped through and closed over it. 

If we see a 3rd day to this rally I will look for resistance of the black bear channel to be tested at 382.2 which is also next resistance. The one thing I am seeing is that this looks very similar to the September 7th to September 12th dead cat bounce. If we look at the stochastics also you can see that we are hitting the same overbought levels that we did back then. While we might get one more push up I do suspect we see downside the end of the week. In order to trust this rally I would like to see 370.6 support back tested and held. 

Key support- 375.4 (black support line vbottom) -&gt; 372.4 -&gt; 370.7 -&gt; 366.7

Key resistance- 378 -&gt; 381.4 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.2

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/738g8lhrrur91.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f3e8222aef43eb16fbc4148465565bf90399e9

Futures did break through its key black falling wedge resistance. The next major resistance would be up in the 4000s which uses the august and September peaks. Futures also rejected the daily 20ema at the EOD. Unless futures opens green and never loses 3805 support we are going to see that support line broken finally and that could lead to more downside. 

Key support- 3805 (black v bottom) -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735

Key resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925

&amp;#x200B;

I am seeing a hanging man candle formed on the Apple daily chart with a rejection of the Daily 8ema. With the phantom print on SPY we are seeing a massive hanging man on spy and the similar one on Apple. Look at the May 17th candle on spy for an idea of what COULD happen. 

Apple rejected 146 9 times before it finally closed a 15min candle over it EOD. However, even with that close it still is below its daily 8ema. Due to the daily candle structure unless apple opens over 149.4 (2.2% green and holds that all day it will break support and should open the downside). With SPY and Apple I am looking for a double top at 378 and a double top at 146 with a bigger retracement. 

Blue bear channel resistance comes in at 148.8 tomorrow which is just below key resistance of 149.4. 

Key support- 149.4 (black v bottom support) -&gt; 142.5 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 146 -&gt; 147.6 -&gt; 149.4 (major resistance)

And then there was Tesla‚Ä¶ you gotta love the way this stock moves. Tesla actually looked fairly bullish this morning breaking over yesterdays HOD and looking to test that red falling wedge resistance near 260. However, then ole ELON decided he is gonna buy the twitterpade and well we saw tesla go for $10.86 sell off in less than 15minutes and a total drop of $13.25 over 1.5 hours before it actually attempted to gather some support EOD. I was blessed enough to have some Tesla puts but not blessed enough to get an IV pump on them‚Ä¶ Despite teslas impressive drop it actually closed a green day and was able to get over 248.7 resistance that it struggled at for over 11 candles before finally like SPY and Apple EOD was able to close over them. 

Tesla is peculiar. As it still remains one that has the most to lose as it‚Äôs the furthest from its 52week low. Tesla has now also suffered back to back days of ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. Being in the inverse head and shoulders pattern the pattern needs to see 220 to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù I do suspect we could see it play out this week. 

Today could have definitely been seen as a ‚Äúrest‚Äù day after Tesla got absolutely beat down yesterday. Breaking 242.5 will be the confirmation of downside to come and a close over 255 would signal a possible bigger bounce to test that black bear channel. A breaking of that red support for the falling wedge will be an early signal of the reversal. 

Key support- 242.5 -&gt; 237.3 -&gt; 231 (black bear support)

Key resistance- 250 -&gt; 252.4 (red resistance falling wedge) -&gt; 255 -&gt; 260.6

The VIX in all reality did nothing today. It did hold key 28.3 support and the daily 20ema. However, it closed under 30 for the first time since September 23rd. One thing that I am seeing though is a gravestone doji candle body. This appears to have occurred in similar fashion back on September 9th which then led to a massive upturn (granted this was CPI day). 

There is a very big potential with the VIX not unwinding at all on this massive green day on SPY that we could see the VIX revert back to 31-32 tomorrow which would take SPY down and the markets with it. 

10% challenge-

Some of my least favorite days to trade are days we have massive gap ups at open‚Ä¶ when we have back to back days of gap ups with extremely weird technical (trin, buy pressure, vold, etc. etc.) I know there is little risk to reward. I played a morning tesla put when I saw weakness in Tesla and was reward thanks to musk but I believe either way I would have been by EOW. From there I didn‚Äôt play much else besides closing my 28dte call on SPY and playing one quick SPX scalp. 

A great trader KNOWS when the technical do not favor their strategy. An even greater trader knows when not to trade and that‚Äôs there will always be another day to trade. Today to me was a clear day 

Youtube will be up later tonight!

An oversimplified but useful description of a credit default swap is that it is a bet that some company will default on its debt. We make this bet for some period of time, say five years, and I pay you $X per year, which is called the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or more often the ‚ÄúCDS spread.‚Äù And then if the company defaults during the five years, you pay me back $100. And if it doesn‚Äôt, you pay me nothing and keep the spread.


This is wrong in lots of important ways that I am simply not going to discuss here, and I will ignore your emails pointing them out, but it is roughly right. 3   It is right to within, you know, a factor of two, maybe a factor of four. One thing that this crude model is useful for is getting a rough but immediate intuition for what CDS spreads mean about the probability of default. If you promise to pay me $100 if a company defaults, and in exchange you charge me $X per year, X/100 is in the ballpark of your expected probability that the company will default this year. Oh it‚Äôs not really a good probability estimate, don‚Äôt go trading CDS on this intuition, and don‚Äôt email me to point out the nuances that it misses. 4   But it‚Äôs the right order of magnitude. If you think that a company is basically a coin flip to default this year, you will not sell me $100 of CDS for $5: Half the time, you will have to pay out $100, and the $5 premium does not cover that. If you think that a company is vanishingly unlikely to default this year, you might sell me $100 of CDS for $1, or $0.50, or even less. Apple Inc. five-year CDS will run you about 30 basis points, or $0.30 per year for $100 of coverage. The people selling that CDS do not think that Apple will default. The people buying that CDS don‚Äôt think that either; they have other reasons for making this bet, which they fully expect to lose.


As of 9 a.m. New York time today, five-year CDS on Credit Suisse Group AG was trading at about 350 basis points, meaning roughly ‚Äî roughly! ‚Äî that I would have to pay you $3.50 per year for this bet, and you‚Äôd pay me $100 if Credit Suisse defaults. What does this tell you about the market-implied probability that Credit Suisse will default on its debt? Well, Credit Suisse CDS was trading at about 250 basis points on Friday,  about 135 in June, about 57 at the start of the year. So it tells you that the market-implied probability of default has gone up a lot. But it is still absolutely low. You would not charge me $3.50 per year for $100 of insurance against Credit Suisse defaulting unless you thought the chances of that happening were slim.
Of course markets can be wrong, and sometimes companies bop along with quite low CDS spreads and then one day default on their debts. (This is particularly a risk for financial companies, which tend to default because of sudden bank runs rather than long slow business deterioration.) But a weird thing happened this weekend where people looked at the chart of Credit Suisse CDS prices, saw them going up a lot, and said ‚ÄúAha! This proves that Credit Suisse is in distress!‚Äù But, no. It proves that a number went up a lot, but remains, in the scheme of things, low.


On the other hand the problem with stuff like this is that then Credit Suisse has to put out a statement saying that everything is fine, and nothing is worse for a bank than putting out a statement saying that everything is fine. (Bagehot: ‚ÄúEvery banker knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit, however good may be his arguments, in fact his credit is gone.‚Äù) 



Yeah, no, high on the list of calls that you never want to get is ‚Äúhi, this is your bank, we just wanted to tell you that everything is fine here, how are you?‚Äù",Matt Levine on Credit Suisse CDS,1.0,2022-10-04 05:54:36

Overall on Apple and SPY there are some major bull milestones hit, however, Tesla had a VERY rough day today‚Ä¶

Taking a look at SPY daily chart here we broke through that blue falling wedge. This is the resistance line we have been trading under since before CPI. However, we attempted to break through the daily 8ema resistance which also was key resistance at 368.1. While we were able to peak out head over it momentarily we saw a really good sized pullback EOD to close under the daily 8ema and soft resistance at 366.8. Overall this is a bearish finish to a very green day and honestly this reminds me almost perfectly of last Wednesday. 

If we can get a continuation rally and close over 370.6 tomorrow which breaks the overall black bear channel then I will be bullish going forward. However, if we reject the black bear channel resistance at 366.8 tomorrow and start to sell off there is a good chance we will see a bigger sell off the rest of the week. At a minimum I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a back test of support at 362.9. If bulls can defend that then we might see more upside, however, lose that and especially lose 360 again and I suspect more downside to come. 

Key support- 362.9 -&gt; 361.1 -&gt; 357.2 -&gt; 352.3

Key resistance- 366.8 -&gt; 368.1 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 374.2 (373.44 gap fill)

Of all the charts Apple looks to be the most bullish in my opinion. But that also makes a lot of sense when you look at how absolutely bloodied Apple was last week. After a 4 day 11% sell off Apple finally found support at 138.2 forming a double bottom bullishly engulfing daily candle. Apple broke through key 142.5 resistance however, in the end closed below it. That will be key resistance to watch tomorrow. 

If bulls can defend 141.4 tomorrow after breaking through that 5 day long aggressive resistance line that it struggled at all week last week that would be pretty bullish going forward. Assuming bulls can keep up this momentum we could see Apple push back to the 150s this week. 

Much like SPY/ Futures rejection at the daily 8ema I would like to see Apple close a candle over the daily 8ema before I get too excited about going long on Calls. 

Key support- 141.4 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 142.5 -&gt; 146.2 (daily 8ema) 

&amp;#x200B;

On September 21st I said that with the rejection at 312 there was a possibility that Tesla could see a retest of support at 220-240. Well I would not have expected this even though I saw the technical setup for it.

It appears to me what is happening is Tesla is about to find its bottom support much like SPY and Apple presumably did last week. There is a potential we see some more downside on Tesla before it pushes up again. 

There is a very aggressive black dotted support line that‚Äôs two days old now that we will look for Tesla to take out and from there it needs to take out that red solid resistance line. IF we can see those two resistance lines taken out it will be a good time to go long on some Tesla calls. However, if we see rejections at those resistance lines then we should assume further downside to go. Also, if today really was just a bull trap and a fake rally like last Wednesday I still believe Tesla has the most to lose with it still being 15% off its 52 week low. If SPY and Apple retreat tomorrow I would be interested in some puts targeting 222 support. 

If the off chance that tesla has some massive recovery day of 7%+ tomorrow, gap fills and rejects 

Key support- 237.3 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 207.2 

Key resistance- 230 (black dotted resistance -5.5% open) -&gt; 249.6 -&gt; 254.6 -&gt; 260.4

The VIX is hinting at more bullish continuation to come, however it still fails to close below 30. I am keeping a close eye on the VIX as you can see the candle from Wednesday on the VIX looks very similar. Today we are also forming a downward resistance line on the VIX now too. As long as that resistance holds, the VIX continues to close under the daily 8ema and preferably gets below 30 I will be more bullish going forward. 

As much as today was a huge green push and there are a lot of hints at bullish momentum attempting to take over and that we possible Friday did put the bottom in‚Ä¶ Im still hesitant. If tomorrow can take out 370.6 on SPY, if tesla can bounce green and if Apple can take out its daily 8ema at 146.2 then with the VIX closing under 30 (preferably under 29) I will be more bullishly biased going forward. However, with that being said knowing we are only 3% from the 52week low on SPY and knowing that we are at the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel I would not take Puts here except as an intraday swing. 

I do think that puts overnight tonight is a high probability play just after such a big green day and TRIN being extremely outta wack all day we naturally could see a small retracement to retest supports before continuing up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something else I actually completely failed to think about last week is that this is the week before the next CPI reading. Currently they are at a consensus of 8.1% and a forecast of 8.3%. This would mean this would be the third CPI in a row to show a decline. Now granted CORE cpi does matter as we saw back on September 13th but With the markets being forward looking we could much like the September CPI be seeing a small push up in anticipation of this CPI. 

As much as we logically know the FED will not pivot (really they should not pivot) after BOE last week did QE and now if inflation truly peaking if we get another good CPI (especially if CORE is down) we could see markets go on another rally much like July. While its illogical given the overall market and economy if the markets get a whisper of Fed going Dovish or pivoting we are going to see a pretty impressive rally much like July. At least until either the FED says don‚Äôt be dumb that‚Äôs not happening or until the next CPI in November and FOMC. However, if CPI comes in hotter especially CORE come October 13th we are most likely going to see the actual bottom get put in. As markets will know Fed is going to have to go even more hawkish to tame inflation. 

10% challenge-

Overall all today was a great day for me. I played some nice SPX calls. I took profits really early on my plays as I wasn‚Äôt sure what we were going to see when we opened that huge green pre market, especially with Tesla selling off. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kc7g97j7pnr91.png?width=572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aca9330a20bbf6b34849d35e9ecb4241aa1cf63b

I closed some longer DTE swings I opened on Thursday and Friday last week. I honestly probably could have help all of these swings and been just fine but after a big 3% green day in the middle of a massive sell off its silly to not take profits. I did leave some 363C 28dte calls run though. 

Overall I was able to secure about 2x my monthly goal today. Going to be in humble mode and conservation mode the rest of the week. 

The #1 thing I see people do is they have a killer hour, day, week, or month and then they get overconfident and trade away all their profits they just worked so hard to earn. 

This market is extreme volatile and will chew you up and spit you out faster then you can hit sell. Continue to conserve capital and trade lightly. Remember the goal of this bear market is to survive until things are better enough that we can more easily profit. We cant do that if we trade away all our money and profits.

It appears the trend of a red open and a red close is holding true now for 4 quarters in a row. Something to keep in mind for next time. 

The question with what looked like a strong morning that turned weak and had a lot of weakness EOD with stocks like Apple still in a massive sell off‚Ä¶ whats next? Is the bottom in? or did SPY just start its next leg down?

Here you can see we broke through both supports of that red diamond I was talking about. In theory that should lead to a bigger downside move. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ehc0l0jc2r91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2395343f4a8b93818a94826d5b64e106fa58a8bf

Here is the cleaned up chart for SPY now. You can see the blue falling wedge is still entact and the black bear channel also is still intact. What I am seeing forming on the markets here and I mentioned this yesterday was that 360-370 was clear consolidation and until we see one of those levels broken we should be patient. Now that the 360 downside has not only been broken but it was closed below the favor is there to downside. However, the issue we have here is that we have been selling off non-stop for a month now. 7 of the last 8 days have been red (-8.3%),  11 of the last 14 days have been red (-11.5%), 17 of the last 25 days have been red (-15%) and finally 21 of the last 32 days have been red (-16.9%). 

That is a ton of selling and this has SPY closing a daily candle below the 75% retracement (blue dotted line) of this 2022 bear channel for the first time since June. However, this still does not feel like for SPY capitulation. This is just a slow boring bleed. This isnt the -5% like we had at CPI this is just a slow bleed and the VIX is not hitting those capitulation levels. We are either starting our next leg down and next week is going to be the week the blood hits the markets with VIX closing over 40 or the bottom fell out here with quarterly options expiration and we will see a push up from here. Honestly I went into today and was bullish most of the day but now I am worried with SPY closing below the weekly 200ema for the first time since the 2020 covid crash‚Ä¶ however, once we closed a candle below the weekly 200ema that was bottom‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9dbe1xijc2r91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cd0f102c9617770c1d04fdc29a80e7091eb3c2a

Closing a candle below the weekly 200ema and the full body being below it is very worrisome for sure. That EOD sell off on spy does have me wondering if we come out swinging bloody on Monday. However, with this weeky candle body we could see a true double bottom of 357 and push green. SPY remains in the black bear channel and has now an intense blue resistance line which forms a falling wedge. 

Key supports for next week- 357 -&gt; 350.2 -&gt; 348 -&gt; 346 (black bear channel support) -&gt; 342 -&gt; 338 (green 2022 bear channel support) 

Key resistance for next week- 353.4 (black falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 357 -&gt; 366.6 (weekly 200ema) 

What I am seeing that unless SPY opens down 1.1% Monday and holds there all week for a push lower to 346 then we will open persumably taking out that blue resistance and that should provide some upward momentum. However, unless bulls can really gather momentum and take out the weekly 200ema at 366.6 then it is likely short lived upward momentum. With 6 of the last 7 weeks closing red we are on pace to test the 10 out of 11 red weeks we saw from march to june. If that is the case we truly could see 330 by end of october.

Futures also broke through its diamond pattern today and broke out of its similar consolidation from 3650 to 3730. 

I will be watching that blue support line closely as we have 3 touches on it so that should be something that is able to withstand a test. Current futures is doing its best to close over 3600.

Similar idea here on Futures weekly here. We are seeing that the blue falling wedge is about to come to an end next week when we open. Now mind you we could always false breakout and then drop from there but SPY and Futures patterns are pointing to upside from a technical stand point. Same thought process here is that unless we open pretty deep red (about -1.4%) on futures and hold there we will see that blue rising wedge broken. 

Key support- 3600 -&gt; 3545 -&gt; 3528 -&gt; 3500 (black bear channel support) 

Key resistance- 3545 (blue falling wedge) -&gt; 3680 (weekly 200ema) -&gt; 3705

Apple to me looks like this week was ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù I think investors finally realized tech is not safe. The one kinda impressive thing about it though is how dramatic the drop on Apple has been in comparison to SPY. So Apple dropped 10.9% or $16.72 in 4 days while SPY only fell 4.1% or $$15.26 in the same time frame. This seems like a rotation to risk off from me. As I have been mentioning for the last two week is that Tech was holding up impressively well compared to SPY that was getting beat up. 

There is a chance people rotated our of non-tech stuff for the last two weeks and finally are rotating out of tech now too. They say TECH is always the last to fall‚Ä¶ Currently Apple is only 6.5% from its 52week low. 

While this impressive sell off make me think we should see a bounce on Apple I would be very careful buying calls until we see that red resistance line broken. It attempted today and I was very convinced today it was going to bounce and that the markets were going to find support. However, it rejected hard at that 143.1 resistance and dumped impressively from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Watching the weekly you can see we have a pretty intense blue bear channel and a lesser intense black bear channel. 

Support- 138 -&gt; 135.5 (black bear channel support) -&gt; 133.3 -&gt; 131.9 (blue bear channel support)

Resistance- 141.6 -&gt; 145.6 -&gt; 149.2

If we believe that the tech dominos are about to fall then my prediction last week when Tesla rejected 312 and I noted this blue arrow inverse head and shoulders‚Ä¶ tesla just might actually see that 220-240 support range. Tesla is impressively still 22% off its 52 week low here. On the daily chart we saw Tesla close below 270 for the first time since July. There is a potential of a support bounce at 258.6, however, if Tesla loses that support next week I do suspect the bigger downside is coming. While comparatively tesla looked much stronger then Apple today (especially this morning) as long as Apple is selling off Tesla will get sympathy weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4t9hkxdmc2r91.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c189e139d7c09d9ecd8bfb0f15d5cf14911bc619

Tesla weekly closed out in a deadzone from 258.2 to 272. There is not a lot of price action here since March. However the biggest weekly takeaway is that this is the first time we have see Tesla weekly candle close below 270 since July. In addition we did have a hard rejection at that 300 level. 

With that blue resistance line I will be keeping an eye on that. If Tesla is to break through that line at some point next week that would be my signal of upside to come. Until then I do suspect we may actually see further downside. Generally speaking a gravestone doji in a downtrend is seen as continuation now reversal. 

If Tesla loses 258.2 I would think the sell off will be hot and heavy down. Think flash crash (most likely coupled with a Apple flash crash to 52 week low. 

Key support- 258.2 -&gt; 248 (black June recovery support line) -&gt; 244.6 -&gt; 222.8

Key resistance- 265.4 (blue resistance) -&gt; 272.1 -&gt; 287.9

The VIX once again is less help then help when it comes to trading this 2022 bear market. On one hand this morning it was unwinding, broke through the daily 8ema and broke the rising wedge which accelerated this sell off before FOMC. However, by mid day the VIX said nah fam just kidding and ripped back to 33.25 before it unwound EOD. 

That is where today is interesting as we have a red VIX day with a pretty large red SPY day. 

The big VIX spike on September 28th to me appears to tell that the bottom is in for the time being, however, IF markets ‚Äúagree‚Äù with the negative sentiment of the markets we COULD see the VIX unwind while markets continue to drop. 

Overall there are a lot of stocks hitting their 52 week lows and hitting lows that have not been seen since 2020. Overall I think we are getting closer and closer to the next bounce. In my opinion much like the May 20th to June 8th bounce I think we are due for another bounce before a bigger leg down takes place. Comparatively this is one of the bigger overall sell offs that we have seen this year next to the June CPI/ FOMC flash crash we had. 

I think if you were to start DCAing into a small 30-60dte call position here you would be well rewarded in time, however, I do have this eerie feeling in the back of my head that next week is going to come out blood red and we are going to see full on capitulation (think covid/ 2008 crash -20% week). However, to experience a week like that we NEED a bigger catalyst. We need that market news that hits that makes everyone go oh no. its time to sell everything and get out while I still have anything left. I don‚Äôt think we are there yet there is a lot of hope in this market and world still. And lets be honest we are not the same levels we were during covid and 2008 crash. 

This is one of those times where it is better NOT to swing and its better to miss 3-4% on the upside move then be early and see another 5-6% down before it bounces. SPY and markets continue to teeter on the edge of the cliff. 

10% Challenge- 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was ‚Äúoff‚Äù but had a tesla swing I averaged down (WAY too late) and was able to close out in the morning before I had to actually leave for the day. I am glad I did too because I really thought when I left I was leaving in a bullish momentum market and when I checked back later I was dead wrong. Markets took a turn. Thankful for not getting greedy there. 

This was my best week I have had since May profits wise, however, comparatively since my position size was about 2-3x bigger back in May this comparatively is the best week I have had this year yet. 

This is definitely one of my strongest months I have had too hitting just under $10k profits and averaging 83.6% over the whole month.

374,1664547030,xs2cwk,1,"Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it will freeze hiring and restructure some teams in an effort to cut costs and shift priorities.

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced the social networking company‚Äôs freeze during a weekly Q&amp;A session with employees, according to a person in attendance. He added that the company would reduce budgets across most teams, even teams that are growing, and that individual teams will sort out how to handle headcount changes‚Äîwhether that means not filling roles that employees depart, shifting people to other teams, or working to ‚Äúmanage out people who aren‚Äôt succeeding,‚Äù according to remarks reviewed by Bloomberg.

‚ÄúI had hoped the economy would have more clearly stabilized by now, but from what we‚Äôre seeing it doesn‚Äôt yet seem like it has, so we want to plan somewhat conservatively,‚Äù Zuckerberg said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta‚Äôs further cost cuts and hiring freeze are its starkest admission that advertising revenue growth is slowing, amid mounting competition for users‚Äô attention. Meta said earlier this year that it was planning to slow hiring for some management roles, and had postponed handing out full-time jobs to summer interns. The freeze was necessary because ‚Äúwe want to make sure we‚Äôre not adding people to teams where we don‚Äôt expect to have roles next year,‚Äù Zuckerberg explained.

Zuckerberg had warned in July that that Meta would ‚Äústeadily reduce headcount growth,‚Äù and that ‚Äúmany teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas.‚Äù Priorities internally include Reels, Meta‚Äôs TikTok competitor, and Zuckerberg‚Äôs futuristic plan for the internet, known as the metaverse. Meta had more than 83,500 employees as of June 30, and added 5,700 new hires in the second quarter. Zuckerberg said the company would be ‚Äúsomewhat smaller‚Äù by the end of 2023.

‚ÄúFor the first 18 years of the company, we basically grew quickly basically every year, and then more recently our revenue has been flat to slightly down for the first time,‚Äù he told staff Thursday.

During its first-quarter earnings call, the company said annual expenses would be roughly $3 billion lower than initially projected, trimming an estimated range that had been as high as $95 billion.

Hey everyone,

I wrote a post not too long ago talking about how we shouldn't fight the fed. In the comments I describe the short positions that had been building against $TSLA and $AAPL. I think a lot of you now understand why Wallstreet was gearing up for war on retail's two favorite stocks.

Now I am going to tell you what their goal probably is and to summarize what the economic trends we're seeing in the consumer based on earnings reports.

Buckle up, you probably want to both hear and not hear what I have to say.

Inflation -- People Are Making Decisions, ""Do I buy store brand or do I buy cheaper?""

So, inflation. The Big I-Word. It's been a disaster for the market. A genie that should never have been let out of the bottle, but it is and we're not done with it yet (clearly). There are a lot of signs emerging that it's affecting the consumer. While it's not affecting the net spend from consumers--yet--it is affecting their choices.

Take $WMT. WMT saw a pretty good upswing in it's earnings last report with quite a good beat, but why is this? Aren't things horrible for retail stores? Well, if you think so, you'd be right. But one person's loss is another person's game. When you're entering tough times and things are expensive you do what you have to do, you buy cheaper. You go for store brand products. Instead of shopping at your local high end Bashes grocery store or Super Target, you hit up Wal Mart, Costco, places that have their entire model built on stretching a consumer/shopper's dollar to the max.

This was our first big key to what's going on. Let's talk about the next.

The Bullwhip Effect

&amp;#x200B;

[What the Books say is happening. This is how you get a glut of inventory](https://preview.redd.it/2evme75dewq91.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f08fa1a17a7c191d0bf059cff198850d6fb56243)

Bullwhip Effect -- AKA Covid ""BUY IT ALL! WE'RE STUCK AT HOME!""

We're seeing a huge bullwhip effect in the market. Places are being flooded with inventory. Yes, this is old news, but it is also current news. $TGT's last quarter was the perfect example for how this god awful situation plays out. Companies ordered a ridiculous amount during the pandemic because all of us sat at home on our phones ordering everything we ever wanted in our lives. Because stocks were so low, places started to double, triple up on their orders in order to try and meet a new high demand that they were forecasting.

Well, it didn't last forever. Plus... this didn't help...

&amp;#x200B;

[Yeah... that's your stuff out there.](https://preview.redd.it/p50gpamfewq91.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b835ca06f519998080f9c16d8315ad5ef5c843ae)

Ship Congestion. That's your stuff out there. Sitting for months.

This stuff sat on boats for freaking months. You might say, 'Hey, Tay\_tay86, I know all this crap. Why are you telling me old news?"" Because guess what, it's here now. That stuff has been unloaded and sent to the stores.

But guess what? It's freaking late. Like really late.

So what does a company like $TGT do? Well, in their case they list on clearance. It costs money to have this crap around. Plus if it sits too long, it has to be completely written off. You know, red tag 80-90% clearance aka please get it out of my store. That gave $TGT a fat \~45% cut in EPS because they have to eat all of their costs associated with producing and then shipping that item at stupid high prices to your fat ass. If it takes too long, they get shellacked.

Here comes out next challenger... Nike. $NKE

&amp;#x200B;

[Here we go again...](https://preview.redd.it/uzj64zvgewq91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=177d873f7aa902a06d9ad318ac66bbac91030e0a)

Our old friend. Mr Highly Engineered Shoes Guyz

$NKE reported after the bell today. All eyes were definitely on them. They've been talking about this one all over the place so going in, it's a hot topic. Well, it's a pretty bad story.

There's a lot of similarities here. I highly encourage you to listen to their entire call.

Their margin's are compressed AF. 22% drop in profits is a pretty dire warning to unprofitable companies or ones that are barely profitable.

1. Any time a CEO/CFO is throwing out catch phrases after every BAD result is a sure fire sign that they are trying to distract you from the car wreck that is their report. I Counted at least 4-5 times of 'We're still the super cool choice for shoes' (Paraphrasing, clearly)
2. They suddenly have too much inventory. Sounds familiar? It should. That's why they are clearing out of the stock afterhours. They are forecasting a repeat of what $TGT just had. $NKE may have squeaked by at 0.93 EPS today, but the next one could be a real gut punch as they try to clear these shoes. Even worse than $TGT, they sell season specific items. This means some of this crap is probably summer oriented when we're going into fall and winter. Yeah, not a good situation. It could potentially be WORSE than what $TGT just experienced. Combine that with the drop in profits and Fx challenges, you've got a real problem.
3. China revenue dropped. I feel like that one didn't get the highlight it deserves. The CEO kept trying to amp up that China is hungry for sports themed stuff that they sell, but yet their revenue there dropped 13%. Didn't they roll out a lot of direct to consumer options? Well apparently they aren't biting. This is a very eerie warning.

Why?

Well, let's start to summarize. Hopefully you're still reading.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Cracking Of Apple](https://preview.redd.it/uppjfyxhewq91.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b327e0f44c102a34631d00e2fd295a0f94fd33aa)

The Cracking of $AAPL

We've had MULTIPLE warnings about China's demand for our multinational in the past few weeks. Let's list them out:

1. FedEx reported economic weakness in China. If anyone knows how things are going, it's the folks who are delivering stuff that businesses are selling.
2. Nike is reporting weaker revenue from China (where their stuff is basically made)
3. Apple is supposedly pulling back a prior manufacturing target by 5-10% due to a lack of demand in places like, you guessed it, China

Now apple's debatable because there's some reports that the Max is doing fine. However, I think that's probably a bullish dream. Their mainstream model is only doing as well as the first.

What's at fault? Honestly, probably the chips and overall market. Nothing inside the phone is dramatically different. It's a big nothing burger and there's not a lot of incentive to upgrade. If you do want to, you might as well shell out for the Max to actually get something.

I believe this is going to result in **a net loss of sales because not everyone will choose to buy expensive when the mainstream model is subpar.** **The upgrade is... minor.**

This is not a homerun for Apple. Wallstreet probably feels very confident about this behind closed doors, but not in public. That's why they've been building short positions against Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

[Closing Time](https://preview.redd.it/tje90u9kewq91.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbb27790f23e8301f7f07db945c1d28d76405ef5)

Closing out

Alright, so let's close this baby out. I know a lot won't read this, but hey, hope you do. If you had read my last one you would have made a killing betting against $AAPL this week.

So what's the trend we're seeing?

1. **There's too much stuff.**
2. **Luxuries are not the draw they once were. Things need to be noticeably different to get the $.**
3. **Because of inflation people (middle class) are choosing to shop at cheaper locations**
4. **Affordability is top of mind (See CarMax which I am not covering here)**

So this is it. This is all great for the battle against inflation, but it's bad news bears for your stocks. You're looking at potentially shaky EPS results as we head into this earnings season and the next. These are not single quarter problems. Inventories can take a long time to physically move through the system.

Which brings me to what this means:

We're probably going lower in the market.

Wall street is coming for retail. They know from all of the data and the clear charts that retail has piled into $AAPL and $TSLA as safety. They are building short positions against it because they have better info than we do. Rumors are already leaking that $TSLA could be approaching weak deliveries for a lot of the same reasons.

You've got Price and Earnings to every P/E ratio. Price has come down a lot, but now we're going to look at E heading south. There's two ways to skin a company.

Let's talk about $TSLA for a second.

&amp;#x200B;

[Tesla Is A Cult](https://preview.redd.it/t0zal9gpewq91.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6922c2439180b2800ab212b5f72dfd1257c23637)

The Cult Of Tesla

# Disclaimer

1. Look, I don't hide my feelings. I greatly dislike Tesla and their CEO Elon Musk. I don't trust him. I think he manipulates the market and uses it to empty his fans pockets
2. I think the cars are cheaply made with a lot of flaws.
3. I don't like cultish love for a human being

Elon has made a mistake. That mistake? Making promises he doesn't keep. There's 1 major promise that Elon should have kept: **Making An Affordable EV.**

I am not going to take you through the logic. It's up above. Read this and you'll understand why I am pointing a finger here. These cars are **EXPENSIVE** and they don't offer you a big new thing than the one you already have does. FSD COSTS EXTRA. These are **luxuries**. What do we know about luxuries? People are choosing to buy cheaper. Carmax DIRECTLY said that affordability is on people's mind for car shopping now. **Especially as interest rates soar making car financing WAY more expensive than it was a year ago.**

I believe this is going to bite Elon Musk right in his lying manipulative ass. His way out, pulling a huge rabbit out of the hat. This could happen soon, or it could happen next year, but it's coming for him.

**Keep in mind he's already tilted his hand calling Austin and Berlin's gigafactories cash burning machines.**

# Final Words

Wall street is coming for Apple. Wall Street is coming for Tesla. They know you're holding it. They are two, massive, giant piggy banks sitting in a market where the bears have eaten everything else alive. Every bear is starting to turn their heads and they are looking directly at a juicy, fat, pair of piggy banks.

When it's all done, the market is probably around 3100-3300 unless things get disorderly. I expect these two to lead us lower, because lets be honest, not much else can. These two have 'been holding the market up higher.

Further disclaimer: I have positions against AAPL and Tesla. I've been rolling them for a while. I won't share my exits, but here's proof that I am in what I say I am. I started these with 3k. Going strong so far.

Apple has reportedly refused to accept a price increase from its sole chip supplier, TSMC, according to [*Economic Daily News*](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/6644678?).  

The report claims that Apple, the largest customer of TSMC, has rejected the supplier's plans to increase chip prices next year. TSMC has been planning to increase its prices by six to nine percent, depending on the fabrication process.

TSMC's chips were already around 20 percent more expensive compared to those from its direct rivals, but smaller foundries have ramped up their own prices in recent years due to higher material and logistics costs, and TSMC has committed to $100 billion in new investment over the next three years, motivating the company to increase its prices to maintain its premium and pass added costs on to clients.

TSMC was also reportedly keen to stop its clients from canceling orders and ordering more chips than needed in the hope of securing production line space and additional support from contract chipmakers, which has made it difficult for the company to understand real demand.

Following negotiations, Apple has apparently refused to accept further price increases. TSMC makes all of Apple's custom silicon chips, but Apple is estimated to make up more than one quarter of TSMC's entire revenue, meaning that the companies are fairly reliant upon each other. An improvement in the semiconductor industry's supply outlook despite inflation is believed to have hardened Apple's refusal to acquiesce to price hikes.

Like many of Apple's suppliers, TSMC has been wrestling with supply chain issues since 2020. Last year, it was speculated that Apple may have to raise device prices to account for substantial chip price rises.",Apple Reportedly Refuses to Accept TSMC Chip Price Hike,1.0,2022-09-28 18:08:58

392,1664372137,xqcxuq,1,"Apple Inc. is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Cupertino, California-based electronics maker has told suppliers to pull back from efforts to increase assembly of the iPhone 14 product family by as many as 6 million units in the second half of this year, said the people, asking not to be named as the plans are not public. Instead, the company will aim to produce 90 million handsets for the period, roughly the same level as the prior year and in line with Apple‚Äôs original forecast this summer, the people said.

Demand for higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro models is stronger than for the entry-level versions, according to some of the people. In at least one case, an Apple supplier is shifting production capacity from lower-priced iPhones to premium models, they added.

Apple shares fell about 3% in pre-market trading in New York on Wednesday. US stock-index futures were also lower.

In Taipei, key chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.2% and Apple‚Äôs biggest iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. was down 2.9%, amid a wide selloff of electronics suppliers. ASML Holding NV, maker of advanced chipmaking gear, dropped as much as 3.2% in Amsterdam.

Apple Suppliers Drop as Firm Said to Ditch IPhone Output Boost

Apple had upgraded its sales projections in the weeks leading up to the iPhone 14 release and some of its suppliers had started making preparations for a 7% boost in orders.

An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.

China, the world‚Äôs biggest smartphone market, is in an economic slump that‚Äôs hit its domestic mobile device makers and also affected the iPhone‚Äôs sales. Purchases of the iPhone 14 series over its first three days of availability in China were 11% down on its predecessor the previous year, according to a Jefferies note on Monday.

Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row‚Ä¶ This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. 

SPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I haven‚Äôt felt ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. 

CNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the ‚Äúworst week of the year for stocks‚Äù with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently‚Ä¶ and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with‚Ä¶ I wonder how this week is going to finish out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. 

The one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didn‚Äôt just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row‚Ä¶ I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. 

Support- 362.1 -&gt; 360.2 (red support) -&gt; 358.2 (blue support) -&gt; 355.4 -&gt; 352.3

Resistance- 364.3 -&gt; 365.6 (red resistance) -&gt; 368.2 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill)

Taking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. 

Key support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545

Key resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770

Looking at apple this morning once again‚Ä¶ which has been trend for the last week‚Ä¶ we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. 

I was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. 

The thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we haven‚Äôt hit capitulation and we haven‚Äôt been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish‚Ä¶ this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. 

Key supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1

Key resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421f0e076579dbbf7cccfc8a56f8f154fa23a45e

Tesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. 

Tesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. 

Support- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) 

Resistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292

&amp;#x200B;

Just when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading‚Ä¶ it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50‚Ä¶ I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in.

I am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I haven‚Äôt really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. 

The next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. 

10% challenge-

You know honestly not my best day today‚Ä¶ I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. 

From there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. 

This is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. 

I am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs why when in doubt we don‚Äôt swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. 

Overall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight.

My 3 favorite long-term metrics on the app are:

1. Growth Rating- How likely a company is to grow in revenue and/or size in the next 1-2 years
2. Profitability Rating- How likely a company is to be profitable in the next few years
3. Upside Breakout - Higher scores indicate a larger chance of a sharp move upwards in price, any time within the next 1-2 years

&amp;#x200B;

My 3 favorite short-term metrics on the app are:

1. Net Institutional Flow- Tracks if institutions are buying up or selling off a stock, or options
2. Net Options Sentiment- Provides information on how long or short the market is on short duration options
3. Net Social Sentiment- Gauges positive &amp; negative sentiment from social media, as well as the difference between them

The last time we had 5 red days in a row was July 8th to July 14th where SPY dropped from 390.64 to 371.04. The 6th day was a huge 1.91% green day. Before that was the June CPI/ FOMC drop where we put 5 red days in a row with a drop from 415.82 to 370.59. There was one green day (fomc) of 1.43% then we had 2 more red days down to 362.17. From there we saw a bigger pop of 3 of 4 days being green and going from 362.17 to 390.09. There has not been an instance of 6 red days in a row on SPY since Feb 2020. 

We have to ask ourselves are we in the same level of turmoil as Feb 2020? I would say no we are not. But we are clearly in a pretty bearish period of time in the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9t02og5dj9q91.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f32fa0e1647668cf9ebcc2fa89479db2e6f2ecf

Got a lot going on the daily chart but let me explain. I had mentioned the similarities for June 8th to June 17th on the SPY chart and this daily candle close today just made it even more similar. On June 16th we put in a candle of 370.94 to 364.08 followed be a 369.38 to 362.17 candle (that would be two back to back candles with a slightly lower high and a slightly lower low). Friday was 370.62 to 363.29 and today was 370.21 to 363.03‚Ä¶ the exact same thing.

This to me could be a very large double bottom forming on SPY. Now only that but that June 17th low as I mentioned came after a 7 out of 8 red day stretch and SPY currently just put in its 8th red day out of the last 10 trading days. If spy is going to bounce its here‚Ä¶ and if its not going to bounce the massive face melting dump is about to begin‚Ä¶ Failure for SPY to make a new low for the year twice now sends a pretty big message especially with these large EOD intraday v bottoms we are seeing. Todays price action brought spy to the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel also. 

My anticipation here after 5 red days in a row is that we are going to see a large green day tomorrow and most likely will close over 370.6 resistance. From there I would anticipate a move back to 380-390 by end of week much like we saw at the June low.

There is a pretty enormous inverse head and shoulders forming on apple daily and weekly with a current support of 149.2. Apple and overall tech today held up much better then SPY. What I am seeing which is the same as last week is that this is not a NASDAQ driven sell off. I tend to be bullish on Apple as long as it holds 149.2.

Key support- 149.2 -&gt; 147.1

Quite a bit to unpack here on the Tesla daily. I mentioned last week I forsaw after the 312 rejection a possible head and shoulders forming with a target of 222-250 (blue arrows for visual). However, looking at the smaller red arrows we actually are forming a possible bullish 270.3 support bounce with a possible target of retesting that 312 level again. 

If tesla closes below 270.3 on the daily chart then I would look for the bigger sell off to play out. However, as long as we are holding support here at 270.3 there is a play on calls to 300-312.

Key support- 270.3 -&gt; 251.2

Key resistance- 283.7 -&gt; 291.6

The VIX was again on a pretty big mission today and saw a ton of intraday volatility. The one thing I am seeing here is that the VIX still has not broken that black dotted resistance line from the Jan 24 and May 2nd highs‚Ä¶ Until that line is broken and until we see SPY break 362.17 (low of year) I am under the impression we hold support here. The VIX really has struggled to stay over 32 barely closing over it today. If the VIX breaks over 33.1 tomorrow and especially over 33.7 tomorrow I would be looking for a bigger sell off on SPY to take place. However, we may see the vix unwind and close back under 29.7 tomorrow which further points to a bigger green day tomorrow.

I am holding these calls. I had opened them at market open today. If my thesis holds true these will be itm tomorrow and green. I would like to close them tomorrow if possible but would consider holding till Wednesday if it looks like we are pushing. My first target for selling is the 373.44 gap fill (2.5% from close). If we make a new year low I will close these at a loss.

Overall pretty great day today despite the big morning reversal and high volatility. 

Remember when the VIX is over 30 (aka high volatility) we should be risk off here‚Ä¶ we should be less greedy and should be careful of rogue moves up or down. Protect profits, preserve capital and live to trade another day.

407,1664203427,xol9qd,1,"I am a red-blooded U.S.-based investor and I have performed practical research that indicates that the GBP will continue to free fall relative to the USD.  **I am targeting exchange rates below 0.25 GBP to 1.00 USD.**

I was doing some spring cleaning this weekend and I found my keepsake box.  I took a break to look through it and reminisce, and under 5 pairs of your mom‚Äôs panties I found some old GBP bank notes that I kept as souvenirs when my career in the professional corgi-riding circuit was tragically cut short due to a knee injury.

So, I decided to do some research.  I took the GPBs to five establishments to see what I could buy with them.  The results were shocking:

At McDonalds, I asked for a quarter-pounder with cheese.  When I presented the money the cashier looked back at me and said ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù  I told him that it was British currency and he said he couldn‚Äôt accept it.  I quickly realized the problem and re-ordered a ‚Äúroyale with cheese.‚Äù  The cashier told me that they didn‚Äôt have that on the menu.  I realized that I had to account for the lower exchange rate, so I revised my order to an eighth-pounder, no cheese.  Still no luck.  I finally asked for the largest amount of food I could buy with the money and I was kindly asked to leave.  Not a good start for the GBP.

I tried several other places: Costco, Jamba Juice, Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods, the Apple store, etc.  I even tried to go to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond WITH one of those 20.0%-off coupons that they shit into my email inbox every other week - no luck.

No one wanted to take this British money.  Feeling confident in my due diligence, I stopped for a frosty at Wendy‚Äôs on my way home.  I paid with USD, because I would never try to swindle little Wendy or her late father Dave.

As I was pulling away from the drive-thru, next to the dumpster I saw who I can only assume was a WSB degenerate with a sign that said ‚Äúwill bend over for TSLA shares.‚Äù  I showed him the GPB notes and asked him what I could get with that.  He said he didn‚Äôt want my clown paper, but said that he could help me out ‚Äúon the house‚Äù because he needed the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù for the forthcoming recession.  I quickly drove away - I don‚Äôt need some unpaid intern bugging me every five minutes saying ‚Äúhow else can I help, how else can I help?‚Äù

So, in closing: I tried to use British currency to purchase goods and services at multiples stores in my area of America.  NONE were willing to accept my cash.  This leads me to believe that the GBP will fall much, much further, and may even be completely worthless.","Why the British Pound will fall much, much lower against the U.S. Dollar.",1.0,2022-09-26 14:43:47

3. **Their social activity is growing substantially** (people are showing interest in these stocks. They‚Äôre talking about them across social and news &amp; posts about them are trending)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Adobe $ADBE:**

While $NVDA and $ADBE experienced recent spikes in social activity, they do not show the same kind of sustained growth in activity (continuous interest from people) as many of the better-performing stocks. 

Therefore, in times like these when the macro environment and markets are bearish, it‚Äôs probably best to keep your eye on stocks with sustainable increases in social activity, rather than the stocks with little growth or growth that fades quickly. 

So, will $TSLA, $AMZN, and $AAPL hold above their bear market lows? Or follow the rest of the market? 

While the social data presented in these charts don't provide the answers, they do provide a different perspective that's interesting to think about.  

How do you interpret this information? Do you find it interesting and useful?","$TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN have yet to revisit their bear market lows, while the S&amp;P 500 and QQQ already have. Will these stocks follow the rest of the market?",1.0,2022-09-23 21:10:17

Does that mean we are at the bottom? Or does it mean people are playing drop to drop? Lets take a look.

Lets take a look at the SPY daily. WE actually have a VERY interesting trend forming. Lets take a look back at June. Two days before CPI SPY was trading at 415.82. It then went into a two day sell off leading into CPI followed by another sell off leading into FOMC which was then followed up with two days of selling before the bottom was put in at 362.17. Total sell off of 13% with the bottom being a breakdown of the weekly 200ema but a closure over the 200ema on a Friday.

Now lets look at the present day SPY. We were trading at 411.73 one day before CPI that led into a CPI sell off into FOMC and we are now two days post FOMC and we just hit 363.29. That would be a total sell off of about 12%. We just broke through the weekly 200ema and rallied EOD to close over it. 

Looking at the daily candle we just put in a massively long hanging man candle and left a large almost $3 gap about to 373.44. We have clearly established ourselves in this downward channel and we have now broken into the red zone which is 351.21  to 370.7.

After SPY put in 4 red days in a row I would be a little surprised to see a 5th red day Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the weekly is quite interesting with what we saw happen today. We just broke the orange dotted support line which dates back to the 2020 covid crash recovery and is also precisely where the June low bounced. Now the one interesting thing is that we did bounce hard and managed with an impressive $5+ rally EOD to close back over the 200ema. This means we still haven‚Äôt closed below the weekly 200ema in over 2 years. The last time this happened was June and as you saw that was the bottom. Monday very well in my opinion could be green. The last time this happened in June spy opened 1.2% green.

Now when we look at supports and resistance here when it comes to supports some of these are going to be projections/ trajectories based off historic data and are more educated guesses since we have not spent time down here in a very long time. 

Key support next week- 366 -&gt; 358.6 -&gt; 354.7 -&gt; 339.9

Key resistance next week- 375.8 -&gt; 385.4

Futures daily put in a really nice base at 3660 today. That was a very hard bounce and 3660-3670 continues to be stout support.

Having broken that weekly support again these supports will be projections based on historical price action. The biggest take away form the weekly is that we hard bounced off the 200ema and much like SPY refused to close below it once again. 

Key support- 3676 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3442 -&gt; 3415

Key resistance- 3825 -&gt; 3900

Interestingly enough Apple daily actually looks fairly bullish. While we did see 150.7 support break down and Apple did temporarily break through that 149.2 support it failed to break and make a new weekly low. Closing out a dragonfly doji on the downside here. I would too be looking for a relief rally much like we saw on September 19th.

Apples weekly candle closed out with a gravestone doji with one heck of an impressive wick and closing below the candle body of the previous week. Generally a gravestone doji at the top of a run would signal downside much like we saw the week of August 15th, however, on a down trend as you can see during the April/ May sell off a gravestone on a downtrend can actually lead to bigger sell off. Apple did hold that 149.3 support EOD. 

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 145.7 -&gt; 142.7

Key resistance- 155.8 -&gt; 158.1

Of all the charts I would say that Tesla is the bearish of them all. I called out on Wednesday that with that rejection of the 312 level and breaking the daily 8ema that I suspected Tesla to be the best short of them all. Turns out I was correct. We not only saw a bigger sell off we broke through support of that red bull channel. Tesla is one that held support and failed to fully breakdown compared to SPY and the rest of tech. 

As you can see by my blue arrows we are actually seeing a nice inverse head and shoulder forming with a price target of 222 to 252 in the next 2-3 weeks. I still think Tesla at this point will be a great short, though I expect an overall market bounce on Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla weekly broke through that bull channel support also and closed below the daily 8, 20, and 50ema. WE should look for a test of that 244 support in the next week or two with a potential for 222 in the next 3-4 weeks. 

Key support- 272 -&gt; 258 -&gt; 244.4 

Key resistance- 288 -&gt; 300.2

My anticipation still remains an overall bounce in the markets followed be most likely a sell off into Friday. Quarterly options expiration is on Friday. I do expect us to see a bigger rally come Friday and I do believe that is going to start the next leg up. However, as we saw yesterday with the massive rally EOD too there is a chance people took profits EOD today only to re-up their position for today. However, EOD today we did not see the same last second drop that we saw on Thursday which to me tells me people did not fully up re-up their positions. 

SPY has now dropped about 16% from the August 16th high. While there is obviously a bigger shift into a bearish sentiment I still am someone who believes we need to see continued catalysts to sell. Today was one of the first days where we had a true selloff (even tho a lot of that happened overnight and was erased EOD with that push) without a catalyst. 

Historically per CNBC next week is the worst week for markets, if that is true we could very well end up making a new 52week low. However, I will say failing to touch a new 52week low with -250 sell pressure (that‚Äôs super high as -5 to -10 is normal) does say a lot. This was clearly not capitulation and I am really not sure what will cause that and if we ever even get it.

We broke through that blue support line today which I fully expected as futures had broken their yesterday and Apple broke its last week. We could not for the life of us break through that 374.2 support line with 13 total bounces off of that level. However, we also could not break through 376.7 resistance either. 

Today truthfully was a very tight range day holding only $4.22 total movement for 55% of the average 10 day range of $7.63. 

My anticipation is that tomorrow we will see SPY test 370.7 support. If tomorrow closes red that would be our fourth red day in a row and I would be looking at a bounce into next week. However, IF we break up and back test 382.2 resistance then we could see the drill continue next week. 

My thoughts are this:

Test of 370 support tomorrow and we hold then we see 383 maybe 390 retested next week.   
 Test 370 and lose it then we are looking for a test of the weekly 200ema down at 368 and the 2020 covid support. IF we lose that AND close below it‚Ä¶ then next week is going to be hella red. 

No test of 370 and we test 382.2 and reject then next week will be the time we take out 370.

No test of 370 and we break and close over 382.2 I like a green week next week.

Spy Weekly did break through the support of that black bear channel. I will look at the end of the week to find the new support. Key support is that orange dotted line which is the 2020 covid recovery support and also where the June low bounced‚Ä¶ we we break below 368.5 there is a lot of pain ahead for the markets. The weekly 200ema has not been closed below since June 2020 and it is only 1.6% from close today‚Ä¶

Futures held the overnight low of 3763 and never broke it intraday. That was my known support. Markets will need to take out that support in order to see a bigger sell off. 

Key support- 3762 -&gt; 3671

Key resistance- 3805 -&gt; 3880

Interestingly enough futures weekly has not broken its black bear channel support yet. We should look for markets to take that support out now that we have seen SPY break its similar support. 

Key support is at the weekly 200ema of 3680 for tomorrow. Futures has not broken or closed below the weekly 200ema since April 2020. So you can see how big of a deal that would be‚Ä¶ 

Overall for SPY and Futures IF we close below the weekly 200emas tomorrow then I would anticipate a pretty red week next week. That‚Äôs the type of milestone that the media is going to eat up and drive the bear narrative and capitulation narrative.

Looking at Apple‚Ä¶ a little update I posted in my server‚Ä¶ So I did some back testing on my success rate with Apple. While I honestly do pretty well with it and over the last month average about a 75% win rate with it I am averaging about an 86% win rate with SPX right now. For me I will be breaking up with Apple plays (at least day trades), however, I will continue to watch it and continue to look for some longer 14-30DTE plays if they present themselves. 

I mentioned this diamond pattern on Apple earlier this week and we finally today saw Apple break through it, however, it did not want to touch 150.8 support. The one thing though is that on that run back to the top Apple hard rejected 154.5 and the daily 8ema. This should be seen to me at least as a reconfirmation of the downside. 

I would like to see apple close below that red dotted line which is the 50% retracement of the bear channel for 2022. Once we close and hold below that I will be better believe in a bigger sell off coming. 

Key support- 152.4 -&gt; 150.8 -&gt; 149.3 

Key resistance- 154.5 

As long as apple closed below 154.5 and its daily 8ema tomorrow I would continue to hold a bearish bias for Spy and the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple weekly is looking pretty bearish but I am worried about that hammer candle right now. That could send us into a double bottom and a green week next week. Ideal I would like to see apple close below 149.2 tomorrow which is its key support.

I called out that Tesla was looking like an amazing short being it rejected 312 again and it had broken its daily 8ema and its support line. Well turns out that was a pretty great call. I guess you can TA Tesla‚Ä¶ haha

Tesla loss that key 292 support today and it even tried to retake it at one point but was unable to. However, it struggled to break through that daily 50ema at 285.8. Tesla will look to break that 50em and test the channel support at 281.3 tomorrow. If tesla breaks through that red support line I would be a big fan of another 14 to 30dte Put play on Tesla. 

Key support- 281.3 -&gt; 270.2

Key resistance- 292 -&gt; 299.8

Tesla weekly actually is holding currently right at its weekly 8ema at 288.5. Tesla hasn‚Äôt closed below that since August. A close below that I would be looking for the next support test at 272. As you can see that 270-272 range for Tesla is a big target. 

Key support- 288.5 -&gt; 278.3

Key resistance- 301.3

Tesla closes under 281 tomorrow and I would look for a short for next week, a close under 278 I would even expect a bigger drop down to 245 to 252. This is a play I am highly considering taking depending on how tomorrow plays out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty much done tracking the VIX at this point as it just seems to be detached from all reality and all of the market. I remember a time where we could reliably trust that the VIX and SPY would be connected and correlated. Not so much anymore. However the VIx closed in the same 26.9 to 28.4 range without really anything to show for it. Red day for spy and a red day for the VIX.

I took profits on the Tesla, Apple and SPY 15dte puts all before 1130 even hit. I played a few other small positions intraday but with another tight range day I found myself sitting cash. The technical today once again did not play well for me for entries. Actually I took a really solid technical looking play on some Apple puts around 1007am and got wrecked by an unexpected bounce only for it to drill the next candle. That was my first sign to get out and stay out of this market today. 

The funny thing about this market is that days like yesterday with FOMC even with those massive candles the technical actually played nicer with those candles then they did today. We are continuing to have big moves opening hour, last hour and the inbetween is left with tight ranged chop. 

As I was saying today and earlier this is giving me heavy flashbacks of June and July when we were stuck in violent chop, no trend and overall wrecked havoc on my portfolio. I am going to be treading lightly and at the first sign of struggle after 3 really solid weeks of trading now and getting back on a good path I will decrease size and happily sit cash when needed. 

Remember 2022 and probably 2023 is about capital preservation for the next bull market. Sure there is 100% money to be made in this 2022/23 bear market but look around you‚Ä¶ a lot of people are getting wrecked right now and capitulating out of trading for good‚Ä¶ some of those are even well established traders. We have everything to lose and nothing to gain right now. Unless you are trading for your livelihood right now there is nothing wrong with decreasing sizes, decreasing profit targets and tightening up stoplosses. 

**Tomorrows game plan:**

\-Watch overnight and of course opening hour. If we break 374.2 I expect us to go down and retest support at 370.7. If we break through 370.7 I will be eyeing the 2020 covid support line at 368.4. If we break through that support and most importantly IF the daily candle tomorrow CLOSES below the weekly 200ema of 367.6 I will look to open some 7dte or 14dte puts on SPY. Next Friday is SPY quarterly expiration. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see us dump into that and then when JPM rotates we rally. 

\-On Tesla if it breaks through that 281 support and especially if it breaks through 278 support tomorrow I will look for some 14DTE puts with a take profits target of 245-252. 

\-As much as I think Apple will see the 120s-130s in the next few months I don‚Äôt see a good signal for me to want to short it. 

OKAY here is a little offtopic‚Ä¶ non-ta based slight conspiracy theory thought that crossed my mind‚Ä¶

Next week friday is the quarterly JPM morgan collar rotation... they had bought 4000 calls and sold 3580 and 3000 puts if i recall correctly... We magically hit 430 and rejected and now that we are headed next week into friday quartely expiration look where we are... 

What if, and this is totally a non-TA but psyops conspiracy theory based guess, we do break the weekly 200ema and we drill through 3580 and end up somewhere between 3000 and 3580 by friday. Then we see them rotate the collar and we start the bull rally...

Hear me out here... March 31st quarterly expiration was nearly the top of the big drop from 462 to 362. The June 30th quarterly was nearly the bottom before we rallied from 371 to 431. 

What if we are about to put in the next bottom before we go on another quarterly rally till December 30th when the next quarterly expires... It would line up pretty close with the cycle analysis and would make sense having no fomc till November, the usual santa rally and rallying for midterms....  
 

And for those of you who forgot how violent these days are‚Ä¶ SPY rallied $8 in about 2.5 hours last JPM only to sell off EOD. The quarterly for March saw a $7 drop in about 45minutes and a total intraday drop of almost $8.5. Next week will definitely be interesting. 

No youtube video tonight. I will have the normal weekly video up that‚Äôs more detailed and recaps the week and projections for next week up tomorrow.","9-22-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA",1.0,2022-09-23 00:16:45

I wont lie though they definitely flipped the script a little bit on us here! I did not anticipate a $7 drop at 2pm into 230pm. However, that 215 to 230pm gave us a good hint to the upside that was to come. I was anticipating a 235pm rip however that rip came a little early started at 231pm and I did miss quite a bit of profit there. I stuck to my plan of entering at 234pm‚Ä¶ saw a nice 30%... dropped to -30% and then it ripped back up to 20%... got a kinda shit fill at 16.7%. I was happy to exit profitable as it did appear we were not going to see the normal green ripper, however, seconds later I woulda been looking at 75-100% profits instead of only 16.7%. Thanks to my position size though this was still a nice win for me so im happy overall. But I once again didn‚Äôt trust myself to play the plan out‚Ä¶ or did I just not succumb to greed?

The biggest bearish undertone that we should take away from today is the failure of spy to even retest 390 completely. With todays realistically known 75bps hike and expected hawkish JPOW we should have closed over 390‚Ä¶ we are seeing the true weakness of the markets here‚Ä¶ The most bullish things markets have going for them is next FOMC is in November and next CPI is still 3 weeks away. 

Spy daily just put in a big huge engulfing, daily 8ema, and falling just short of key 390 resistance daily candle. This looks pretty bearish to me. Overall we broke below 378.8 and gap filled (finally) the July 14th 378.57 gap. That only leaves the June 17th 369.38 gap which is a measily 2.2% away from close‚Ä¶ And that is my target for tomorrow.

Spy is still maintaining both the black and blue bear channels and is now trending back below the 50% bear channel retracement. My target tomorrow is a test at that 370 support level on the daily. 

Key support- 375 -&gt; 373.5 (blue support) -&gt; 370.7 (major daily support) -&gt; 366.75 

Key resistance- 378.8 -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.2

SPY weekly is going for its bear channel support test at 375. If we break this support it will open up a bigger downside. The biggest place I suspect us to bounce if we truly sell off is that weekly 200ema at 368. If we break below and more importantly CLOSE below the weekly 200ema on Friday‚Ä¶ I surely hope you all liquidated your accounts because the crash is coming‚Ä¶

Futures weekly did find support today at its blue bear channel, however, it too rejected the daily 8ema for the 2nd day in a row now. 

Key support- 3793 (blue support) -&gt; 3762 -&gt; 3670

Key resistance- 3827 -&gt; 3880 -&gt; 3925

Futures weekly is trending just above its key weekly support line of 3790. This will be a key support to watch both overnight and tomorrow. 

Key support- 3790 -&gt; 3675 (support and weekly 200ema)

Key resistance- 3900

Apple chart actually is giving me some pretty big September  12th / 13th dead cat bounce vibes. I mentioned this in my youtube video but we are currently seeing one of my favorite patterns playing out on apple right now. It‚Äôs the diamond pattern. Its very similar to a breakout/ down symmetrical triangle but the general principle is that when support or resistance of this diamond breaks the move is explosive. 

Apple closed below its daily 200ema and daily 8ema again. This is a pretty bearish overall movement for Apple. It failed to reach resistance of that blue bear channel and failed to completely bearishly engulf. 

I am looking for a break down closed to 150 on Apple and a test of that red support line. If that red support line is to break this week we should be targeting 130s to low 140s. 

Key support- 152.3 -&gt; 151.6 (red support) -&gt; 150.7

Key resistance- 154.3 -&gt; 154.5

&amp;#x200B;

On Apples weekly I really would have liked to see a retest of that black resistance at 161 but it looks like we may go for that support test at 145.7 (-5.3% from close)

Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 145.7

Key resistance- 155.7

&amp;#x200B;

By popular demand‚Ä¶ I will now be including Tesla in my TA and I actually will consider some plays on Tesla in the future once I continue to watch it and see how it actually obeys supports/ resistance. I will only trade it myself IF it actually trades realistically and rationally. 

We are looking at a pretty significant red bull channel on Tesla that dates back to the June lows. Tesla really hasn‚Äôt seen the big sell off that SPY, Apple and the rest of the tech has seen. 

We just watched Key resistance at 312 reject for the 6th time in less than 2 months. I would not be long on calls until that resistance is broken and closed over. I am seeing a breakdown of the blue support line that started back on the September 6th support line bounce. With his breaking and closing below its daily 8ema I see weakness with a target of 292 followed by 270. 

&amp;#x200B;

Key 301 resistance is still holding on Tesla. With this being the 7th week in the last 9 weeks to reject at this 301 level. Key support 278.6 and key resistance 326.8.

&amp;#x200B;

Wow now that‚Äôs a doji candle if I have ever seen one! The VIX had an impressive range of $4.63 or 18% from low of day to high of day. A few really interesting things about the VIX here‚Ä¶ Throughout the day it actually began to unwind from its high around 28 before FOMC. We saw FOMC hit and it instantly hit 30 before it started its unwind. The VIX seemed very confused to say the least today. Overall tho the VIX closed a massive doji and it broke through that black resistance line of this downward channel. 

You can see the next resistance is that blue downward channel that is the top of May 2nd, June 13th, and June 16th. If we see this blue resistance line broken on the VIX I do suspect we are going to see vix touch high 30s if not 40s and SPY could put a new bottom in. This is a tough place to be because the VIX used to be a very good guide for what SPY was going to do‚Ä¶. We have been so detached from reality since June honestly the VIX is very hard to trust or gauge a trade off. Best VIX play would be wait for the 40s+ and short it. 

10% challenge-

Honestly today played out almost exactly how I expected‚Ä¶ I expected a green open (played calls for a nice 35.6% gain and sold immediately at open). I suspected based off historical trends that we would see SPY put the top of the range pre-FOMC in around 10-1030. I did attempt a small put in the morning and barely got out with a 3.5% gain as premiums were not moving. I just waited it out until FOMC. 

I was looking for that 235pm bounce and despite a massive $7 sell off I was still committed to my plan. My only regrets of the day is 1. I was too rigid in waiting till 234pm and I should have entered at 231pm when I saw the bounce happening early. And 2. I sold at 16.7 % (bad fill) when my position went from green to red to green. I sold about 10 seconds before it did the expected rip of another $4. MY goal was to sell before 245pm and I sold around 242pm. I should have waited an extra 2-3 minutes. However, with the massive $12 drop EOD from the high at 245pm in retrospect I am glad I sold when I did. It was still a great play overall. 

I did call out overnight puts based on the historical trend and clear bearish sentiment of the markets. I waited regrettably way too long to get into that put. I expected a small bounce EOD there back over 382. But I entered a 375 2dte put and I ended up selling it right before EOD.

**Respected Trader and Investors,**

Yes yes i know i was suppose to send a detailed weekly Wall Street newsletter but the thing is my friends have arrived in my house and they just wont let me finish ""Wall Street newsletter 3 : Why is the dollar stronger"". We are doing all sorts of crazy things over here. You guys can come join us too. We are just a Pacific ocean away. Lol.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so w/o any further delay and BS like my predecessors i give you the perfect chart. 

**Analysis :**

&amp;#x200B;

[Weekly support is broken](https://preview.redd.it/mkomw6ts26p91.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d44b352d90f145f6836f70ae30a459d8b0b3221e)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Error**

Also i wanna apologize on the behalf of Sasuke whosoever read his comments or listened to his BS on talk show and in personal Dm's or wheresoever that how $3396.42 is the perfect bottom. Well sorry to disappoint you folks but that is not the perfect level. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Sasuke san overused his Mangekyo Sharingan since February. He has gone to meet his brother and get his eyes checked.](https://preview.redd.it/n9d32ldi76p91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=152ead975c89b309c5a7b724f54d426c117e03c7)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hence why i am sending this new chart and kinda like a repeat of previous letter. I hope you don't mind. Hf's and Institutions please change the buy order wall. Its not the level that we should be targeting.

&amp;#x200B;

# The answer is : 0.75148 or 75.148% i.e. Historical bottom : $3437.22 ( SPX levels )

&amp;#x200B;

*Now don't ask me how did i came up with this answer. Go read previous wall street newsletter. Also hey ""Ray Dalio"" and ""Jeremy Grantham"" don't eye $3200 or to be precise $3195.28.  Please sir 61.8% or P/E 14 is too predictable considering ""Apocalypse week of 7yr cycle"" is arriving next week. Change it to 50% fib i.e. $3505.24.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for date the answer Sasuke-san gave you all guys back in Season 1 of ""Wall street newsletter 10"" the perfect date for reversal was October 14th. But the thing is he lost his notes and how he came with that answer lol.

 

[Nailed the first peak \( aug 15\/16 \) and second peak \( missed by a day \)](https://preview.redd.it/5p4f9mn3a6p91.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17381faaddf3bd4d23cc1d924b8af84f2729ddc0)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my analysis for now.

&amp;#x200B;

* October 5 : ADP
* October 7 : Jobs report

&amp;#x200B;

Oct 8 , Oct 9 = Stock market closed.

&amp;#x200B;

* October 12 : CPI report

&amp;#x200B;

We all know CPI is gonna be lower because monetary policy works with a lag. This is the first line that is embedded inside your heads when you join the ""Federal Reserve"" 

The second thing we know is CPI estimates gets priced into markets before CPI release. Meaning the bottom should be before CPI estimates gets priced in. Now our fund calculation says for sure its gonna be October 2nd week so let's figure out the date.

&amp;#x200B;

So the answer has to be October 10  but but but it could also be October 7. 

&amp;#x200B;

# The most likely answer is : October 7/10  or it could be just October 14 ( Who loses his notes. lol )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Result :**

\- Perfect level : $3437.22 

\- Perfect date : Oct 7/10. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions :**

&amp;#x200B;

Itachi-san and I don't share our positions but hey we will give you Sasuke-san position which he keeps sharing after ""Creating a portfolio"" something post. Go read it, its hilarious.üòÇ

Note : This is just the % short of that portfolio. We buy value stocks as well with the portfolio we created here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion :**

Thank you guys for reading this letter in a short note. Yes yes i know today is Federal Fomc but you see we don't care about this meeting. Why coz everyone cares about it. We don't dwelve and discuss what if 100bps or what if 75bps or what if dot plots. We know what's gonna happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see there are gonna be two outcomes of Fomc i.e. 

* **Post Fomc pump**

&amp;#x200B;

In this scenario we will pump for 2-3 days and then we will go dump to our levels coz ""Apocalypse week"" is approaching but yes it could make it harder to reach our level but i have not a single doubt in my mind that we will not reach our levels by october 2nd week. Dont forget to add into inverse etf in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Post Fomc dump**

&amp;#x200B;

It will make it even more easier to get our level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Market has discounted the Fed tightening that is compression of PE multiples but what about E itself. In simple language markets are currently pricing how high the rates might go but they aren't pricing that what if Apple doesn't make money by selling iphones this year coz yk parity in eur-usd. Who will want to buy iphone in europe. Think about it.

It was the eve of FOMC and all through the markets the chop was playing out. Probability of a choppy range day was there but I did not really expect that red of a pre market. Overall I think we saw some risk come off the market today. 

Before people ask‚Ä¶. FOMC is tomorrow‚Ä¶ rate hike drop at 2pm and we are expecting a 75bps hike‚Ä¶ presser starts at 230pm‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cfynahorr2p91.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b218c55ffc32681bcf467c4281e07187b430a4

As you can see we are holding sentiment at a 17% chance of 100bps and a 83% chance of 75bps‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt even any chance we see a 50bps hike tomorrow which is interesting. 

Note- TA will be brief as much like CPI‚Ä¶ FOMC will unnaturally move the market and we will have to evaluate EOD tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a7do287sr2p91.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2150669caa245c997d3552e31412510b38b11eff

A little fun facts for you guys.. of the last four FOMCS pre market has averaged an open of 0.725% and on average FOMC closes with a green day of 2.33%+.

That means we could be expecting a pretty green pre market and from close we should look for about 392-393 close tomorrow. If we happen to get some sort of bullish hoorah from JPOW tomorrow then we could see a bigger 3-4% day. But I would be we see a 2-3% green close based on historical data. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY daily we have a dragon fly doji with a bullish engulfing daily followed by another dragonfly doji‚Ä¶ overall 382 is establishing itself as a stout support. We did breakdown and close back below that red dotted 50% channel retracement level tho. 

Key support- 382.2 -&gt; 378.7 -&gt; 375

Key resistance- 385.6 -&gt; 388.5 -&gt; 390 -&gt; 393.2

&amp;#x200B;

SPY weekly currently forming a gravestone doji. Key support remains at 380 and key resistance remains at 390. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really would have liked to see Futures close back over 3900 today, however, it looks like it will close below 3900 and will lead to a new lower close. This is the lowest close since July 18th. 

Key support- 3830 -&gt; 3762

Key resistance- 3900 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3973

&amp;#x200B;

Futures weekly breaking through its previous double bottom. Key support remains at 3790 and key resistance 3900 -&gt; 4000.

Apple is just that little stock that could‚Ä¶ closing as the lone green top 10 tech. It continued to look strong and break through a lot of pretty major resistances today. IT broke through key 154.5 resistance, daily 200ema, daily 8ema and broke its black bear channel. Apple is looking fairly strong here. 

Key support- 154.5 -&gt; 152.4 -&gt; 150.8

Key resistance- 157.5 -&gt; 160

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ou6jlsbvr2p91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60d151712a974e74e575f95053ccc45d62eea88f

Apple weekly is really establishing 149 as support here. I will be looking for apple to continue to hold 155.9 and attempt to take out this bear channel resistance at 161.4 by EOW.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yo4y0kuvr2p91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6971362d5d444919b48f79cca3aa3a9b70cb99c4

VIx continues to remain pretty unphased by everything that is happening‚Ä¶ it did close back over key 26.9 resistance and once again established 25.5 as support. Tomorrow with FOMC we should expect a small push up around 28-29 but as long as JPOW sticks to the script of 75bps and doesn‚Äôt go anything wild we should see it close back near 25.5 EOD. 

10% challenge-

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4n2ob4bwr2p91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d07eae4e8ba6cda099c20f7d8077d89048c668

Pretty great day overall. Had a bit of struggle this morning that‚Äôs for sure catching some bad bounces on those Puts. Technicals for me at least were a bit of as struggle today. We say VOLD trending in extreme bear momentum almost all day and pretty much sell off all day long. We never really saw green buying momentum to represent the bounces we were seeing. Not only that but with apple at times up 2% and spy down 1% there was a lot of divergence in the markets and the VIX was disconnected (as I mentioned most likely would be). Definitely was a struggle trading today. But came out on top.

Based on probabilities of a green open on FOMC I decided to open this call. I wasn‚Äôt going to swing calls but this play is about 10% of my normal position size so even if we go to zero its like taking a 15-20% stop loss on a normal sized played so I liked the risk‚Ä¶ Overall I will close this at open regardless of trend‚Ä¶ unless it opens red then I will wait until fomc presser at 230 and attempt to close it on the run up. 

Good luck tomorrow. Expect a lot of consolidation after an initial morning push around 1030 and possibly a retrace back to opening price before 2pm.

Looking at the SPY daily chart we actually have some pretty bullish short term movements and indications on it. Looking at Fridays candle I mentioned it was a bear day with a hanging man candle during a downturn which should have allowed for upside reversal like we did see today. In addition to that now we put in a nice 2nd support bounce and hold at 382.2 and the daily candle is a bullish engulfing candle. We did fail to gap fill by about 23 cents though. I would have liked to seen a push higher towards that 390 resistance level by the EOD but in the end this was a pretty big bullish day. In addition they managed to push price action back over the 50% retracement line of this 2022 bear channel (red dotted line).

We did see a breakout over that red/blue falling wedge just as I suspected we would see that I mentioned in the Friday weekly TA. Next stops 390 and the black bear channel resistance. 

We have to keep in mind that Wednesday is FOMC day.

Markets are still heavily expecting a 75bps hike and that‚Äôs what I would put my expectations at too. I don‚Äôt think core or CPI was high enough to warrant a 100bps hike‚Ä¶ yet. 

Key support- 385.5 -&gt; 382.4 -&gt; 376.8 (blue bear channel support)

Futures is actually selling a reversal with upside even better then SPY is currently when we factor in the Friday hanging man and this dragonfly doji. With a close back over 3905 we should be looking for a retest of 3973 and possibly 4025 later this week. Key support remains at 3905 and 3850.

Futures weekly candles are actually forming a really nice double bottom much like we saw the week of August 29th and September 6th. This should provide a nice upside boost with 3888 being key support. With trending back over 3900 we will look for bulls to defend those two key levels.

Apple came out with the bullish fireworks today closing not only a bullish engulfing candle after that Friday hanging man/ doji it nearly engulfed two days. It fell just short of key resistance at 154.7 (daily 8ema).

Tomorrow bulls will look to conquer the daily 8ema and close back over it. With a major breakout of that red/blue falling wedge we will look for a test tomorrow of the black bear channel and later this week of the blue bear channel.

Key support- 152.4 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147

If you remember last week I said no calls as long as spy is under 390 and VIX is over 24.7 and no puts if VIX is under 28.4 and over 390. So far the VIX and SPY are closing in on that 390/ 24.7 duo. The VIX also put in a big bearish engulfing candle breaking the rising wedge support today. WE should look for the vix to break under 25.5 and close back under that. However, there is a chance with fomc on Wednesday we could see the VIX detach from SPY a bit and see the VIX push higher in anticipation of FOMC while SPY does its own disconnected thing.

Overall today was an excellent day for me and an excellent Monday. Only loss I took today was an apple call. I was playing the 5ema bounce and while it was holding the stoch indicated it was time to exit so I exited. It did go on to be profitable but when I was already having a pretty killer day there was no need to risk a -20% stop loss hit. I did have that 2% win that shoulda been 10% win not fill the 10% limit. Sold as we were heavily retracing and I didn‚Äôt wanna go red. It of course went on to push hella green. 

The biggest take away today was this smaller position size and slightly more aggressive entries have been a really solid improvement to my profits and win rate. I continue to close profits early as most of my positions went on to run to be nearly double what I sold at but I am being mechanical in my exits to prevent ‚Äúbeing smarter than the chart.‚Äù

Back to the real DD. So we all know that most taiwan stonks are being hammered due to political tensions wtih China, and also inflation. 

On the China front, this is Taiwan, and HIMX's tech has become pretty integrated with most automobile and average household items like smart fridges and automobiles and nobody knows due to NDA NDA NDA. Taiwan and the West both play fair and respect IP, and HIMX has over 3000 patents. All three major companys like META, APPLE, MSFT, AND GOOGLE, SAMSUNG, VALVE, are creating AR/VR tech, and HIMX's ceo has been betting on this since 2015, with more emphasis on AUTOs and smart household items, which we are seeing a huge amount of shortages of. SO?? This means an American company will probably acquire it soon. 

INFLATION: When inflation starts investors tend to move away from growth stocks and put their money in safe havens. well HIMX is a pretty good safe haven, 5$ per share you get 1.25$ of divy per year. If it keeps dropping to 3$ they'll be the most undervalued stock in the history of the stock market if they happens I'll personally go down to wall street and pull the race card, this is unacceptable.

Think of all the people that have no where else to invest and know in 20 years this dip wont matter‚Ä¶ there is still a ton of money being poured into this market and there will be.

When the CPI miss came in we had a massive push that a 100bps hike was going to come pricing as high as the mid 30%s before the day was over. As you can see markets only think there is about a 17% chance of a 100bps hike on Wednesday at FOMC and I do expect to see that number decrease and even for some to expect a 50bps hike (small amount) by Wednesday. This is a change in sentiment for the market. The one thing to hone in on next week is what JPOW will have to say about the November (remember no October meeting) rate hike‚Ä¶ he could hint at a 100bps hike and that could be a big red catalyst for markets or he could surprise us this time with a 100bps hike. If he drops a 100bps hike I would be prepared or a major red day on Wednesday. 

Now I will post a FOMC post next week but there is really no historically sound trend for the week of FOMC.

This week we closed out a red week at -5.17% which is actually the 2nd reddest weak before FOMC. As you can see though in January there was a flat to green week and in June we had a -6% red week. Even just looking at the days leading up to FOMC there is not a good enough trend to follow on whether we should expect red or green. However, the one thing to note is that July meeting. It was the outlier with the only time we had a green week before FOMC. But even that week had a bigger red day on the Tuesday before FOMC. We can honestly expect more chop like today until FOMC plays out and market gets more information from the fed.

Looking at the SPY daily chart we are now at day 22 of this sell off and we are at 12.9% drop from low to high so far. Remember looking at the previous sell offs for the 2022 bear market they average 15 days and 13.3%. We are quickly approaching that 13.3% market (375.3) and we have already surpassed the length of 4 of the 5 sell offs. The only longest sell off was the March to May sell off which was 31days and 16.7%. 

We did looking at the red dashed diagonal like break and close below the 50% retracement of this overall 2022 bear market channel. With that 386 price level being the key pivot. 

The one bullish takeaway from todays daily close is that we have a gap above to 388.78 that needs to be filled which a back test of that key 390 pivot level would fill and we did close a dragonfly doji on the daily. A doji like this on the daily at the bottom of a sell off should actually indicate the possibility of upside. However, this does not always play out as you can see on Sept 14th to Sept 15th we had a doji on a sell off that actually led to continuation not reversal. 

Using the red solid resistance line and the blue support line you can also see that SPY is in a massive falling wedge right now that gives resistance for Monday at 385.7. If we break through that level or open over it on Monday that should give way to some upside (especially factoring in the doji candle) and I would be looking even more intently at the gap fill and 390 resistance retest. 

Overall major daily support is down at 370.6 and major resistance remains at 390.1

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5vkus6n2gao91.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2252eced7ff805ac95fa2c094c4eebb98696368c

Looking at the weekly chart you can see that SPYs weekly candle is a clear fully engulfing bear candle. And on top of that we broke below the weekly blue support line and we closed below key 390 support level. Overall the weekly chart gives a pretty big indication that their could be some more downside to go. 

Going into next week being that we appear to be clearly in this bigger weekly black bear channel I would use that to play level to level. Knowing the last time we got this close to support we had a big bounce the risk to reward of entering puts here is low. 

Key support next week will be at 380 (-1.4%) -&gt; 375.2 (-2.76% and is black bear support) -&gt; 368.6 (-4.6% and the weekly 200ema)

I would be a little surprised to see another -4.6% week next week to reach the weekly 200ema, however, that is the place we bottomed at in June and we could attempt to make another bottom there. Its hard to see but I will  next week if we get close to it zoom out to show it better but that orange dotted line is support form the lows of the September 2020 and October 2020 weekly lows. This is the support that the June low held. This will be a major pivot point and level that bulls need to defend if we close in on it.

Futures closed a hanging man daily candle which is also a reversal candle after a bigger sell off like that. The biggest bear thing on futures is that it not only broke through 3900/3905 but it closed a candle completely below it.

Futues weekly in a similar pattern and took out that oh so important 3900 support today and closed below it which confirmed the bearish engulfing weekly candle I pointed out yesterday. With a breach of the blue weekly support line on both SPY, ES and Apple the downside indication really is opening up. 

Key support- 3825 -&gt; 3675 (weekly 200ema) 

Key resistance- 3905 -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4088

While SPY could not quite get its footing to close its overnight gap Apple was able to close it EOD. Apple is looking increasingly bearish though compared to SPY at times. The one big thing I am seeing (and it actually is one SPYs daily chart too) is a massive falling wedge. If we use the blue support line and the red resistance line you can see that we are at a massive falling wedge right now that unless we open red on Monday and drill all day we will break through on Monday at open and that should give upside potential.

With the hanging man daily candle close, the EOD push up and the falling wedge resistance that should be broken at open Monday we should look for an upside push towards 152.4 and possibly even as high as 154.7 Monday or Tuesday. 

Key supports- 150.7 -&gt;  148.5 -&gt; 147 -&gt; 144.8

The Apple weekly has made a textbook beautiful bear channel. We have two touches on support (August 8th week and this week sept 12th) then two resistance touches of August 15th and this week sept 12th). We should really treat this channel as a big deal right now. Until we break out of the resistance I would NOT be going long on any calls. Yes you COULD play calls from the support bounce (which happened intraday today) to the upside but you are playing with fire because despite stronger support the bottom could fall out. However we can continue to play level to level like we have been on Apple. With the weekly engulfing candle on Apple also there is a lot to be expect red next week. However, we must keep in mind that FOMC is a market moving and technical breaking event‚Ä¶ 

The coolest (well to anyone who likes TA) is that the level supports/ resistance actually align perfectly with the bear channels support/ resistance for next week. Its pretty rare to have solid points like that. 

Key support- 150.7 -&gt; 145.6 (bear channel support) 

Key resistance- 155.7 -&gt; 161 (bear channel resistance)

The VIX continues to be a thorn in everyone side and continues to be at times detached from reality. We did see this morning the VIX catch up to pre market and was racing for the 30s but was hard rejected at 28.45. We did see a wick over that resistance line of the overall downward channel (started in June) but we did not close over that level. We also relost the 26.9 support level and closed back in that no mans land 25.5 to 26.9 level. 

Remember my criteria for going long puts= close below 390 AND VIX close over 28.3‚Ä¶

Remember my criteria for going long on calls= close over 390 AND VIX close below 24.7

It would take quite a deal right now in this market to convince me the risk to reward of going long on puts or calls is worth it right now.

Overall I actually had a great day today and this week was a great week for me. I continued to hone in my ideal position size which for me is that $750-$1250 price range depending on SPX contract costs (and usually about $1k for Apple).

I continued to side by side watch Apple today and had some very high success with Apple intraday today. This morning was rough and the afternoon was even rougher with the chop and the tight about $1 range we traded in for nearly 2 hours. Overall a great week of day trading. 

While I do not regret my trade for CPI it is just further confirmation that for me day trading far far outweighs swing trading and with proper stop loss mitigation at -20% and smaller postion sizes with more aggressive entries seems to be my sweet spot. 

One lesson I took away just personally this week that regardless of what I am seeing on SPY or Apple I need volume to back it up. Unless that volume says bullish if I am getting into a call its not the right time yet. The last few days have been extreme choppy with the volume and candles have lacked follow through and continuation due to the choppy volume. 

Overall a great week I can walk away from with no issues.

June 17th (left side above) was a -0.22% close with a pretty much a range day with a total range of 369.38 to 362.17 for a $7.2 total movement. Note that this was the BOTTOM of the current 2022 bear market. 

March 18th (right side above) was a 0.78% green day with a range of 444.86 to 437.22 for about a $7.64 total movement. This was part of the March bull run. 

So looking at the only 2022 quad witching days we really don‚Äôt have enough info to say anything with certainty. However, the only thing that is a trend is that we could see about a $7 movement.

There is an interesting 1, 2, 3, 4 move happening on SPY right now that is similar to the April to May sell off. The move was 1. Sell off, 2. Dead cat bounce, 3. Drop then consolidation, and followed by 4 bigger dump. Currently in that trend we are at 3 which is the 2nd drop and consolidation before the final third drop. If that is the pattern we are in and we can actually break through 390. 

Bears did make some progress today closing back below 390 and making a lower close under 390.5 avoiding a true double bottom. However, key 388.5 level was not breached today and was not closed under. Being that we have seen a close and plenty of movement around 390 and still managed to recover I would be really hesitant to be long on puts here until we can close a candle under 388.5 and make see a full candle close under that 391 level. 

Key support tomorrow is 388.5 -&gt; 386.2 (this is the 50% retracement line for the overall 2022 bear channel) -&gt; 385.2 -&gt; 382 -&gt; 378.7 (blue bear channel support) 

Key resistance- 391.1 -&gt; 393.1 -&gt; 395.4 -&gt; 397.8

&amp;#x200B;

SPY weekly actually is looking more bearish then the daily is. We did see that reconfigured support line from last week once again breached. That is very bearish going forward and we are also seeing that 390 support level tested. A close tomorrow below 390 would indicate that there is potential downside to be had next week. In addition, we currently have a bearish engulfing weekly candle. 

Key support- 390 -&gt; 380

Key resistance- 390 -&gt; 402 -&gt; 412

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8p22m80ng3o91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0595087227fc9d9483dc9f5857ca0f774646ef7

Futures does not look as bearish as SPY in my opinion with this candle hard rejection 3905 intraday today and continuing to hold that support. However we are seeing two full candles below the daily 8ema and that in and of itself is bearish. 

Key support- 3905 -&gt; 3867 -&gt; 3828 (blue bear channel support)

Key resistance- 3973 -&gt; 4006

&amp;#x200B;

We have not seen the futures weekly candle breach through support yet. However it is right at that key 3900 level and is well within reach of not only testing it but breaching and closing below it tomorrow and would complete the bearish weekly engulfing candle. 

Key support- 3900 -&gt; 3830 (black weekly bear channel support)

Key resistance- 4025 -&gt; 4100

If we were to see SPY close at or below 390  and futures at or below 3905 tomorrow to close out the weekly candle with a bearish engulfing candle and assuming the VIX can close over 26.9 I would be comfortable in some Friday DTE puts. However, you have to be careful as FOMC is Wednesday and that does usually leave to a bullish pump day. We have and could easily see Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday all be red days with Wednesday the long pump. IF you play weekly puts or even longer DTE puts I would recommend closing before FOMC and repositioning EOD of FOMC.

Apple continues to show more weakness then spy does much like last week and two weeks ago before the big dead cat bounce. 

We saw apple make a new recent low and we saw a new recent low close. Closing below that key 153.8 level. There is potential for a retest of that level tomorrow and a rejection there would be a nice play on some puts both intraday and for next week. 

Key support- 151.5 -&gt; 149.7 -&gt; 147.9 (blue bear channel support)

Key resistance- 153.7 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qkvgj3kog3o91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9af3f2a115896d81991e717dcfedc439f6b2ce6

Apple to is working on a nice weekly bearish engulfing candle. A close below 152.7 would confirm the bearish engulfing candle and would insinuate more downside to come next week. 

Key support- 150.7 -&gt; 148.8 (black weekly bear chat)

Key resistance- 155.8

If apple manages to close EOD below 152.7 and definitely if we breach 150.7 with a close there would be a play for Friday DTE next week puts with again the same idea closing below FOMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g50kll3pg3o91.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eb6e33288debd8c63ea9a2c0c61aa0fb9cb06f6

VIX yet again continues to be detached from reality. We did touch 25.5 and that support held and we also touched 26.9 and that resistance held. The VIX with the doji finish is clearly undecided with which way it is going to go next. 

I still struggle and with my above plans struggle to recommend going long on puts or long on calls here until the vix really decides‚Ä¶ until vix breaks out over 26.9 and really closer to 28-30 its hard to believe in a sustained sell off. However, note that markets CAN sell off with the VIX remaining flat and even declining if there is no FEAR in the markets‚Ä¶ such as that markets agree in a sell off. I also struggle being long on calls until we can close under 25.5 and really start looking at 21-23. 

Overall for me‚Ä¶ I still do better with day trading then swings.

Overall the biggest fight today took place at 392 with the majority of big support bounces coming there and not a single 15min candle closing below it. However, we did retest 391 daily level support and failed to break through it. The one thing that is for sure is that 390-392 is one big wall that markets are not quite ready to see fail yet. 

Key support tomorrow will remain at 393 -&gt; 391 -&gt; 390.4 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 386.4.

Apple yet again today spent time trading under and over its daily 200ema now closing its 2nd day in a row below the daily 200ema. This is the first time there has been back to back candles closed below the daily 200ema since May. 

Major support is being established at this 153.8 to 154.5 level and major resistance is starting to form at 157.4. Today I did play a few plays based off the bounces here on support and resistance. Apple actually was a much better trade most of the day then SPY was. I was tempted to dabble in some tesla plays today too but withheld the temptation.

The VIX did a whole lot of nothing today seeing a mild decline and closing back below that key 26.9 level. The VIX is not going to work its way back down to test 25.5.. a break and closure below 25.5 would signal a potential bottom. 

For me while the VIX really has been disconnected from reality‚Ä¶ I would not be positioning myself too long or too aggressively short until the VIX breaks and closes of 28. I also struggle going long on calls while VIX is over 25.5.

So something to keep in mind that is happening this Friday is that it is Quad witching day. Ironically the last quad witching day on June 17th was the bottom and the low of the year so far. While the day itself was uneventful and pretty much just chopped all day and ranged it did put in a bottom and cause one heck of an impressive rally. 

If we look at March 18th quad witching day that also happens to coincide with a pretty impressive rally. Is it possible that Friday will be the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù and we see a rally develop? 

If we think about it while the markets yesterday realized how screwed we are long term the fact that we did not dump today says a lot.

Interestingly enough last night and at open today there was a 30-33% chance of a 100bps hike at the meeting on Sept 21st. However, you can see that the % chance has already declined to 25%. 

There is potential markets hella over-reacted thinking we get a 100bps hike, we consolidate in this 390-405 range until FOMC and when we do get the 75bps hike markets see a bit of a relief rally. There is no FOMC until November so there would be no more fear in the markets and the fear of a 100bps at next meeting wouldn‚Äôt really be a factor until next months CPI. 

Remember it is 100x harder for markets to sell off like yesterday and 100x more natural for market to trend up then down. Markets NEED a reason to sell‚Ä¶ the question now is what is the reason‚Ä¶ And what is that potential next catalyst you may ask?

Currently there is a railroad strike that tomorrow would be the last day to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù it before Fridays cooling off strike period ends and we may see a world of hurt start. 

I feel like a lot of people fail to realize just how much cargo and liquids are transported by rail still in our country. This strike could potentially cause inflation and supply chain issues to get even worse than they already are. The markets very much so could negatively react to this. There were some sell offs today on news but so far the algos haven‚Äôt hooked up on much yet.

I had a really great day trading. I actually did the first 4 trades within the first hour of the markets opening which is not common for me. But lately the first hour has been really nice movements and technical and then the rest of the day much like today was just choppy trash not worth trading. 

I also played a few Apple options todays too. Apple as I mentioned above actually has been looking much smoother and better to trade then SPY has lately. I will look to continue to capitalize on Apple.

Over its entire life span, Intel has never had an RSI value on its monthly chart be this low. This brings to question, is it Intel's death? I don't think so. There are a few things we need to consider with Intel; Taiwan, x86 and RISC V, GPU, ARM chip manufacturing, and upcoming manufacturing plants.

[Look at the RSI \(1-month chart\)](https://preview.redd.it/my6bmdx0eun91.png?width=1756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d6e8bd5a2608e06eca54314e8794dfd0f07d9ed)

Taiwan

As you may know, tensions between the US, China, and Taiwan are rising, bringing a considerable risk for TSMC. If Taiwan becomes a part of China, TSMC's business will get limited by the US government. Companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm use TSMC for chip manufacturing. If the US stops dealing with TSMC, they will increase their spending on local chip manufacturing, and most of the G7, G8, and G20 will follow.

X86 and RISC V

Intel knows x86 is dying, so they've been looking for a new solution. ARM is not entirely out of the question, but it also uses an aging process. Though ARM is more energy efficient, it has its security flaws. Intel is investing a lot of money and time into RISC V as a new CPU architecture. While not supported by Windows yet, there have been many improvements in the space, and RISC V could be a threat to ARM in the future.

GPU

Intel is starting to make GPUs available to the public. The first generation may not be their best work, and there will be things to work out, but the room for growth is massive, and with their in-house chip manufacturing, they could bring manufacturing costs down and seriously compete with Nvidia and AMD.

ARM Chip Manufacturing

In 2023, Intel will be manufacturing and shipping ARM chips for other companies, expanding their sales and chip process domains. This will allow Intel to dip their toes in ARM chips and allow them to profit from the situation in Taiwan. If Nvidia, AMD, and Apple can't use TSMC, they will have to reach out to Intel for more chips. 

Upcoming Manufacturing Plants

The US government recognizes they can't use TSMC if China takes over Taiwan (which is mainly why they would go to war) and therefore wants to increase chip manufacturing on US soil. They will invest in Intel. They are planning to make more facilities soon which are super expensive. 

Though Intel is struggling in the short-term, in the long-term these things will work out. The R&amp;D is very intense with this company, and Pat Gelsinger knows it. Once things happen in Taiwan, Intel knows it'll be on a path of tremendous growth. It just needs to sit on the sidelines for a little before the next wave of computing comes to the market. You also can't forget they have the majority of CPU sales in PCs even with AMD putting up a serious fight.

Below is a look at a few recent notable insider transactions for penny stock - Globalstar, Inc (NYSE:GSAT).

Director Benjamin Wolff acquired a total of 10,000 shares at an average price of $1.81. To acquire these shares, it cost around $18.11 thousand.

The company recently announced it will be the satellite operator for Apple satellite-enabled services.

446,1663101830,xdi31a,1,"Well lets go ahead and get this out of the way‚Ä¶ yes I bought calls over night and yes I was hella wrong. Inflation had peaked per CPI as I expected coming in a 8.3% vs. 8.5% previous, however, market honed in on year over year and month over month core. Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some‚Ä¶ this is why plays like that should be small in size. 

The worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast‚Ä¶ the psyops continue. 

Anyways moving on! Today was the worst day in the markets since the June 2020 the Covid crash.

https://preview.redd.it/z8ca3rwxton91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b6b89d6dd6357eb10e8d20f17713b689d29071

Today was the 5th largest daily point loss in the whole history of the S&amp;p500. 

So lets take a second and lets think about WHY we sold off so aggressively. 

Going into today markets knew (it was bout a 91% chance) that we would get a 75bps hike and they THOUGHT that inflation would peak. This morning markets realized inflation did not peak (per core), the 75bps rate hike might not be enough to fight inflation so a 100bps hike could be needed, and they are also accepting more and more that a soft landing is not going to happen. 

Markets are not in a rock and a hard place. They were previously rallying on news that few were going to pivot (July to august run) and then Jackson hole slapped markets to reality that was not going to happen. However, markets were feeling pretty bullish going into this CPI. Now that markets realize there is nothing to be bullish about this is where things get interesting. 

Is this the start of a capitulation like sell off we saw in June around that CPI (remember it dropped 10.3% in 3 days) or was this a massive market over-reaction to a potential 100bps rate hike that was not even mentioned to begin with? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xg2fd3fyton91.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff1a3b52ce9ad7e5c32a7d777b5deb92997d8066

Today we broke down and opened below the 405.2 daily resistance level and didn‚Äôt quite make it to that 390 level. We have not broken back below the red dotted support line using the June low and sept 6th low for support. 

We are looking at a potential blue bear channel which gives EOW support near 380 (-3.4%) or the black bear channel which gives a deeper sell off of 362 (-8%). 

The one thing that is for sure is that we broke through the v shaped recovery support and the next major support test comes at 390.5. This is where I suspect if the bulls are going to put up a fight that it happens. However, if we are to close a candle in the 380s tomorrow or later this week then it would appear we could be in a bigger sell off until FOMC. 

Key supports tomorrow- 391.1 -&gt; 390.5 -&gt; 388.5 -&gt; 386.8 -&gt; 382 -&gt; 368.3

Key resistance tomorrow- 395.3 -&gt; 400.4 -&gt; 402

SPY weekly is starting to show more and more of this current black weekly downward channel. Key support comes at 390.4 and 380. With key resistance at 412.

Looking at the futures daily ES candle this is a 3 day long bearish engulfing candle. Pretty impressive regardless of what side you ended up on today. 

Black bear channel gives EOW support at 3620 while blue bear support comes in more mildly at 3825.

Key supports tomorrow- 3908 -&gt; 3867 -&gt; 3840 -&gt; 3830

Apple with a pretty incredible breakdown today hitting -6% briefly at points. The biggest take away on Apple is that it did break through its red dotted support line from the June recovery. In addition it closed back below the daily 200ema and closed lower then any of the candles last week during the sell off. 

Black bear support line comes in at 139 and blue bear support comes in at 148 for the EOW potential targets. 

Key supports tomorrow- 151.5 -&gt; 148.7 -&gt; 149.4 -&gt; 147

Key resistance tomorrow- 157.4 -&gt; 159.9

Unlike SPY (thanks to apples huge 4% day yesterday) there is no gap left on the daily chart.

In terms of bearish and clean looking charts this apple weakly chart does look extremely clear in what trend we are clearly in with a break in the weekly support line. 

Key support- 150.2 -&gt; 148.8

Key resistance- 157.5 -&gt; 161

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX is where things are going to get a little interesting. You can see how many times we have found ourselves over this 26.9 level but unable to push any higher. There is an obvious reason to suspect we are still in a bullish channel up on the VIX, however, previous to today that channel was breaking down and we were trending clearly back under 25.5. 

While a 14.33% green move on the VIX is big when we look at other VIX days from this year we have plenty of 20%+ moves on the VIX. There was even part of the day today where the vix showed weakness and had even broke back below 25.5 before the EOD push up on the VIX and down on SPY.

Key level to watch tomorrow for the VIX is 28.3 and 26.8. I am wondering with how disconnect the VIX has been from reality and the markets since really the June lows if we could see a major sell off on the markets without getting the vix back to 35-40. 

10% challenge-

Yes my call was worthless‚Ä¶ yes it sucked. Yes it woulda been 1.6k turned into 36k+ had it bought puts‚Ä¶ it is what it is‚Ä¶ youll drive yourself mad in this market going what if this and what if that. 

I made some pretty good progress intraday today recovering those losses tho. 

My biggest lesson once again after going long on puts last week only to get shaken out at a -70% loss (yes those would be up 10.9% EOD today had I held‚Ä¶) and being bullish prior to today (thankfully didn‚Äôt act on any plays besides those swing calls)‚Ä¶ day trading for me is 100000X more effective then swing trading has ever been for me. 

Hope you guys got some gains‚Ä¶ 3 days left in the week lets grind some wins out.",9-13-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis,1.0,2022-09-13 20:43:50

450,1663015304,xcnkng,1,"Today was the eve of CPI and easily was one of the weirdest trading days I have seen in a long time‚Ä¶ Intraday we watched overall volume trend extreme bull almost all day and despite that SPY struggled most of the day after it hit 411.73 during opening hour. Overall a really tough day to trade. Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it. I didn‚Äôt really see any of my idea trade setups today either with the chop and random little dumps SPY would have.

I am going to keep this TA super short and simple and to the point.. why? Well because in the end while technical 100% matter and eventually tomorrow regardless of a big dump or a big pop SPY will find a key level to hug to but until then its just a guess. So lets look at some bigger ‚Äútargets.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Currently credit Suisse released a report that they think CPI will be 7.9% and forecast/ consensus is 8.1% and Cleveland fed CPI nowcast which is usually pretty close is predicting 8.22%. Overall we should expect to see CPI hit that 7.9 to 8.2% range tomorrow in my opinion. 

So If we get a bullish CPI reading tomorrow then most likely we will see a big green open. The biggest openings we usually have from CPI at 1.4 to 1.8%. So on average we can say a 1.5% +/- opening regardless of reading. 

So if we get a good CPI reading tomorrow we should expect an opening closer to 417. Which would be pretty huge as this would put us right at key 417.3 level resistance. From there that will be a big fight that rages on. 

If we break through that resistance then we should look for 421.22 gap fill.  

However, if we get a bad CPI and expect a -1.5% opening we could see 404.8. This would be significant as it would put us back below key level support if 405.3.

Breaking below key 405.3 we could attempt a gap fill down to 400.86. 

Overall we can expect high volatility and a good CPI or a bad CPI in my opinion will guide the markets for the next week until FOMC..

Its hard to give a sold TA based prediction here but in my opinion good cpi + 75bps hike= rally‚Ä¶. Bad cpi and 75bps= rally‚Ä¶ bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump‚Ä¶ bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump

Apple was an absolutely wild child today! Putting in the biggest green day its had since May 27th which was a 4%+ day. 

Apple also put in a heavy volume day today hitting 149% of its 30day average by close and 125% of its 10day average intraday range.

Apple broke through that major resistance from the early august top and that should continue to open up the upside for Apple and the rest of the market as long as CPI comes in strong tomorrow. 

We should expect a solid 3% +/- from Apple tomorrow with a possible range of 168.3 to 158.5.

Not surprisingly we did see a small green day on the VIX today despite SPY in sell off mode. But that should be expected with CPI tomorrow and the increased ‚Äúfear‚Äù in the market. 

I know this post is not like most of my posts but honestly there is little reason to do a complete full blown technical based report when we know that CPI is going to break all norms and cause a bigger move. Tomorrow will be back to your normally scheduled TA‚Ä¶ 

The question is what will CPI be? What way will the markets move based on that CPI and what will markets do once they open? 

10% challenge-

As I had said today was one of those days where the way spy and the markets moved none of my ideal setups were hitting and if I had wanted to enter a trade I would have needed to break my rules. I was able to get 3 small trades in but that was about it. After about 1130 I just refused to trade it.

Deals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business. The practice has gone on for years. Google, at one point, paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to a law suit filed in 2020.

DOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn‚Äôt disclose the amount Google spends to remain the default search engine on browsers and U.S. mobile phones, but described it as ‚Äúenormous numbers,‚Äù reports Bloomberg.

‚ÄúGoogle invests billions securing defaults, knowing people won‚Äôt change them,‚Äù Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington, admitting that Google buys ‚Äúdefault exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.‚Äù

In 2019, Google began giving Android users in Europe a choice to select a provider to power a search box on their device's home screen, and as the default in Chrome when installed. The changes complied with a competitive European Union ruling. The EU fined Google, saying it had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.

The change gave users with a phone running the Android operating system and Chrome browser an option to customize and personalize their device, choose and change their search engine based on their preference. It included selecting the apps to download.

Google, for example, added private, decentralized search engine Presearch as a default option on all new and factory-reset Android devices in the U.K. and Europe.

Since Google added Presearch 2021, its daily searches have grown from about 200,000 a day to more than 4 million, said Alex Carrabre, head of growth at Presearch. ‚ÄúAt the peak it was 6 million per day in the past 20 months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just in the Europe economic area.‚Äù

Carrabre estimates Android has about 70% of smartphone market share in Europe, which means there‚Äôs strong potential for the fledgling search engine to grow its user base.

Google‚Äôs private contracts with companies like Apple, and Samsung form the basis of the DOJ‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit, which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws.

The trial isn‚Äôt expected to start until next year. Thursday‚Äôs hearing was a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google‚Äôs business.

For years, there had been rumors that Globalstar (GSAT) was working with various tech and telecom companies. In 2013, *Amazon reportedly tested a wireless network on a spectrum owned by Globalstar that would have allowed customers to connect directly to the internet.

A finance professor at Tulane University was quoted saying ‚ÄúThis really is the holy grail for Globalstar.‚Äù

Under the agreement, Apple will pay 95% of the costs Globalstar incurs launching new satellites to build out the network. Globalstar said it will raise capital to cover the cost of building and launching the satellites; Goldman Sachs is working with the company to secure financing.

*The most important reason for why Apple chose Globalstar is to stay one step ahead of the competition. The fact that Amazon was so interested in a potential partnership with Globalstar definitely raised the eyebrows of Tim Cook and the crew.

Globalstar is the perfect partner for Apple. CEO David Kagan understands who‚Äôs the big and little brother in this deal. The company isn‚Äôt located in Silicon Valley trying to compete with Apple.

458,1662763924,xa913e,1,"The bulls are back in control‚Ä¶ or are they? 

Lets take a look at a few things before we get into the charts and the technical. 

If you follow me you know that I came into this week bearish and I was positioned with some 390p 14dte puts expecting a touch of 370-380. Now the question is why was a bearish? 

Well going into this week we had the attempted breakout at 430 that led to a massive sell off that led to 3 red weeks with us finally turning in a green week on SPY this week. On a technical standpoint puts made sense and calls would have been against the trend‚Ä¶ in addition we had the CPI looming. Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI. With literally every single fed member, JPOW himself and heck even Biden saying ‚Äúinflation has not peaked‚Äù with the massive sell off, the suspiciously long time we went with no CPI forecast/ consensus one would assume it was because they were going to predict inflation &gt;8.5% (higher then previous). However, Thursday the forecast came in at 8.1% and today the consensus also came in at 8.1%. 

Now that we have seen CPI come in bullish, markets have accepted the fact that we most likely will be seeing a 75bps hike no matter what CPI is and markets clearly rallying despite everything JPOW re-iterated Thursday morning‚Ä¶ and now looking at the technical with a massive V bottom rally off 390 (after consolidation) and a break through of the 405.2 level‚Ä¶ its pretty hard to not be bullish going into next week.

After 405.2 broke intraday today and we held it I took a loss on my then 12dte puts I have no reason to expect a reason for us to go down. Now the only reason I remotely could expect any sort of bigger sell off to break 405.2 next week would be IF CPI comes in dogwater like 9%. If CPI comes in at 8.5% or below markets are about to shrek back to 430 if not higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kv3ovp6xwm91.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3847b0ea297345adb8599983c311c6080d9f1b

Looking at SPY daily you can see we have a very sharp and distinct V bottom using September 1st and September 7th to start the V. We have now held that support for 3 days in a row. I spoke on the fact that in the last 16 days there had only been two times that SPY had back to back green days well this is the first time since the peak at 430 that spy has put in back to back to back green days. This in my opinion is the change of tide. The bear sentiment has left the market. 

We broke through that blue resistance line. This is the line using August 16th and August 26th tops. Breaking this line is saying the bear movement is over and we should be looking for the next bull run. In addition, a close back over that level resistance of 405.2 is extremely bullish especially after a failure to continue lower after breaking 390. While we could see a return back to 390 (but unlikely in current bullish sentiment and news cycle) a closure over 405.2 should lead markets to push back for a 417.3 level test. 

Bulls managed to close this daily candle completely over the daily 8ema. Until that daily 8eam is broken we should be bullish. 

Now today did leave a \~$2 gap on the daily chart that COULD be filled before we push higher. I do forsee a scenario Monday where we back fill that gap and see a little weakness going into CPI. Actually a red day Monday would give way for four green days in a row after CPI comes in positive. 

Key supports- 405.2 (level support) -&gt; 402.7 -&gt; 401.8 (V bottom recovery support) -&gt; 400.4 (gap fill at 400.86) -&gt; 397.8

Looking at SPY weekly we are have broken out of that downward channel on the weekly too. Now the one interesting thing is that SPY weekly did break through the blue June/ July recovery support line (futures and Apple also did), however, despite that being a bearish signal we rallied off of that level. 

I called it out earlier in the week but we are seeing a double bottom like formation at 392.2 also on the weekly and closed higher then last weeks candle which should signal upside. With a weekly close back over the daily 8ema and 100ema as long as spy holds the daily and weekly 8emas we should be bullish. 

Key support- 390.3

Key resistance- 412.5 -&gt; 426.1

Futures has a similar V shaped recovery also, however, it did not break through its bear run blue resistance line as that was at 4105. While futures did close back over the daily 8ema it did fail to close over the 100ema. 

Key support- 4060 (v bottom support) -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4008 -&gt; 3980

Key resistance- 4092 (blue resistance) -&gt; 4128 -&gt; 4148 -&gt; 4200

Futures weekly did break through that blue support line as I mentioned in SPY, but with this new bounce we will make the new support recovery line. We saw the weekly also break the black bear channel too along with closing back over the 8ema and 100ema. With a level close over 4025 we will next look for 4160 and 4280.

Key support- 4025 -&gt; 3900 (blue bull support)

Key resistance- 4160 -&gt; 4280

I had mentioned that pretty much all week and even some of last week that Apple was looking extremely weak compared to SPY. We did not see that v bottom recovery that futures and SPY were showing form until today. With two intraweek closed below the daily 200ema that would appear to be very bearish, however, we actually saw Apple put in quite a bit of strength today. 

Apple failed to close over its daily 8ema but we can look for that to take place next week along with pushing for that blue bear resistance from this sell off. 

Key support- 156.7 (v bottom support) -&gt; 155.5 (200ema) -&gt; 154.4

Key resistance- 158 -&gt; 160.3

Now Apples weekly is where things get a little peculiar when you factor in Apples daily and SPY/ the general market and sentiment shift. 

The apple chart is still holding within the downward channel from the August 15th and August 22nd weekly tops. But unless Apple opens under 156.7 and holds there the remained of the week Monday will most likely open over that level. However, we are seeing a gravestone doji weekly candle closed (the opposite of what we saw the week of August 15th) and this should signal a push green next week.

As I mentioned on Thursday the VIX had broken the recovery support line and has closed its 3rd consecutive candle below 25.5 With this failure to breakout to 30 and looming bullish (aka lessened fear) of CPI and FOMC coming up we should expect to see the VIX retest the 18s and 19s soon. 

Where am I at now? 

Overall going into next week I suspect Monday to be a red day or at a minimum a consolidation day with most like a 0.5 +/- finish. While the markets do expect CPI to be bullish I would be hesitant for the markets to close a 4th green day in a row and then have that proceeded by a good CPI and see 5 green days in a row. Crazier things have happened but after 3 pretty big green days (when you think about the last month of sell off) it would not be surprising to see small decline on Monday. A retest of 405.2 and possibly even a gap fill back to 400 could be in play. 

From there I do expect now that the forecast and consensus along with the Cleveland Fed CPI all coming in below previous CPI of 8.5% that we will get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù CPI reading (good as in reading less than previous CPI of 8.5%). I believe this will start a rally into FOMC (the next Wednesday the 21st). From there markets will get their expected 75bps hike (remember markets don‚Äôt like the unexpected so even if bearish‚Ä¶ if its known they handle it well) and from there we see a rally through end of September into October which takes us into the next earning season. 

To be honest with CPI expected (and again assuming its good) coming down, the expected 75bps hike and really no new bearish catalysts to be had (unless someone can tell me something im missing here‚Ä¶) once CPI drops on Tuesday‚Ä¶ there will be really little reason to not be playing calls into middle of October when we see the next earnings start. These earnings could be the only thing in my opinion that would take the market down but even there I don‚Äôt expect any more massive sell offs unless a new catalyst happens. 

My plan-

Overnight calls (small position) 3-5 strikes OTM (going to do some research this weekend on what will be the best play) Monday night into Tuesday morning (for the CPI good reading play). 

I will let Tuesday of CPI shake itself out‚Ä¶ there is a chance core CPI could come in high and we could see a sell off on that but would be unlikely as long as the actual CPI is decreasing (below 8.5%).

From there either Tuesday night (risk on) or Wednesday night (more conservative) I would consider opening some 30-45dte calls on SPY (and possibly Apple). 

If you are aggressive you could open calls on Monday and let those ride also. However, you risk here being wrong about CPI and having CPI cause a major break down. 

Note- I will have my FOMC post up next weekend with a trade analysis and trade plan

10% challenge-

Overall this was a GREAT week for me‚Ä¶ honestly one of the better weeks I have had in a very long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what did I change this week? I spoke on this a little in my last weeks TA but I went from about $1500-$2000/ entry down to about $700-$1000/ entry. I also over the last few weeks have found myself hesitating on entries. Essentially I would be watching my indicators and see the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù setup forming and I would see what would be a great entry forming, however, I would say well don‚Äôt be early‚Ä¶. Be patient‚Ä¶ and what I would end up doing is waiting for extra extra confirmation that the trend move I saw was actually happening. This would net me a great entry but I found I was missing such a large % gains because of this. Moves that shoulda easily been resulting in 15-25% gains were being capped at 3-5% gains because by time I was ready to enter the premiums had already priced the move in and the acceleration of the move was already done. This also resulted in many times that if I didn‚Äôt immediately enter I would end up red. 

With a little big more aggressiveness‚Ä¶ really pro-activeness on entries and recognizing its okay to be wrong as long as I keep a stop loss in place (definitely stuck to my -20% stop loss all week without waver) then I found myself with a much higher win rate and a much higher pay out on the wins I did bring in. This week was a really good mental week for me (and financial week). I look forward to carrying this success and strength into the rest of the month and year. 

Another thing I recognized this week and was able to adapt to was the trend. While I was holding 14dte puts most of the week I did not find myself staying biased the last 3 days. I was able to play the intraday trend while having an overall bearish trend in mind. 

The one thing I could have done differently this week when I look at my 14dte puts I opened after 390 broke and after we closed below 390 was to wait for extra confirmation. I could have waited one more day (which would have definitely resulted in not entering the same puts) and saw that we closed back over 390. A little bit of patience here could have resulted in not even opening that position and that also could have allowed me to more clearly see the support that and strength that 390 was putting in. I did begin middle of the week to recognized the consolidation that was taking place between 401.4 and 390, however, I would have liked to recognize that earlier. The one thing I will say though is that when Apple is known and has been historically driving the markets‚Ä¶ when apple is continuing to push lower and look heavily bearish despite SPYs movements, its not that out of line to expect SPY to catch up to Apples momentum. However, we saw this week that the general market (non-tech) was driving this rally. 

If you look at my intraday log I did open some 30dte calls on SPY and Apple near EOD today but I did decide to close them before EOD. I was going to be pro-active and let these run after the great CPI forecast and everything but I decided that with 3 green days in a row we should expect a consolidation day and possibly even a bigger red day to fill that gap before CPI starts a potential bull run. After being too aggressive with the put swings im okay with being conservative here‚Ä¶ and if I am correct waiting 2 more days to enter calls is not going to make a big difference. The magnitude of this next potential ‚Äúbear market rally‚Äù could take us up near 440-450s by middle to end of October‚Ä¶

Something to look at here on the 15min intraday chart is that for the last 6 days (and really 7) we have been trading within the same range of 401.4 and 389.5. The bulls cant quite seem to break us out over 401.4 and the bears cant quite break us under 389.5. We really are seeing a consolidation zone before we see the next leg up or the next leg down. 

While I would be bearish longer term we did see the forecast for CPI finally come in today and it came in at 8.1%. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vqbkjnotpm91.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef58603711ad6e0361bca41d6ee8f8763aca1cf2

However, we do not have a consensus yet. As you can see from the last CPI consensus and forecast can be different. But they usually are pretty spot on with eachother. It will be interesting to see where consensus comes in at and when they finally release it. 

I think it was pretty tacticful that they released the forecast of CPI today before the talk for JPOW when markets obviously were not having a negative reaction and sell off today. The best assumption for the bullish push today does come from markets positively viewing CPI forecast. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oxuao65ptpm91.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee6b027e0c99386c718ebee6e2d235aaecbcaf6

Looking at the SPY daily chart we actually do have a few bullish things forming that could sway my point of view of where we are going longer term. 

The red bear channel that started with the August 16th top has officially been broken on SPY and Futures. Using the support line from that channel and the support from the last two days of recovery we actually are forming a pretty impressive V bottom recovery. 

There is a chance we could be forming a new intra-trend purple bear channel though when you look at the last 8 days of trading. 

Key support- 397.9 (black recovery V support) -&gt; 393.2 -&gt; 390.4 -&gt; 388.5 

Key resistance- 400.4 (purple bear resistance) -&gt; 401.4 (15min intraday resistance) -&gt; 402.2 -&gt; 405.2

If we were to see a bigger green day tomorrow 1.2%+ we would actually break through the 405.2 resistance line and a closure above that line with the ‚Äúanticipated‚Äù beat on CPI could actually lead to a bigger move back to test 420 resistance. However, if today was just a small rally within the bear leg and we close under 395 and preferably back under 390 (-2.6%) that could be the signal of a sell off to come. 

Something to keep in mind for SPY‚Ä¶ of the last 16 trading days there has only been 6 total green closes and today/ yesterday make only the 2nd back to back green days in 16 days of trading. Each green day (besides the back to back green) were proceeded by atleast a 1% drop and the back to back day was proceeded by a -3.38% day. If we are to see a third green close tomorrow I would anticipate that as a change of tide and be bullish. 

&amp;#x200B;

That EOD small rally actually gave futures the room it needs to potentially be holding and selling the black v bottom support tomorrow. 

Key support- 4000 (black support v bottom) -&gt; 3957 -&gt; 3907 

Key resistance- 4010 (purple intra-trend bear resistance) -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4060

Apple is actually quite peculiar. You can see that the chart does not mirror SPY/ Futures anymore. SPY and Futures both see a nice V bottom forming. However, when you look at Apple today actually marked the fourth day of making a lower low and the 8 lower low of the last 9 trading days. 

Of the last 15 trading days Apple has only closed 4 of them green. The other interesting anomaly is that Apple closed almost -1% today and SPY managed to close +0.65%. We are seeing TECH (well at least Apple) being bled out while the rest of the market rotates and holds SPY up. Its actually quite intriguing to watch. 

Apple was able to close back below its 200ema on the daily today also which is bearish for Apple. While I prefer SPY this might be a time where we see Apple as the better trade. You can also see that Apple is no where near breaking its red bear channel down either. 

Key support- 154.4 -&gt; 153 -&gt; 152.2 (black support of intra-trend bear)

Key resistance- 156 -&gt; 156.7 -&gt; 157.2 (red bear resistance)

One thing that should have anyone in longer term puts slightly worried is the VIX (this includes me). I am seeing the VIX broke through its bull support line and now is actually in a descent down. IT also closed its 2nd day in a row below 25.5. 

Overall when we had broken 390 and closed below 390 I was bearish and felt that it was the right move entering longer DTE puts. My current 13dte 390P are not doing so hot ( I did not average them down today). There is a real possibility that I chose the wrong side and that what we are seeing is truly a bigger 390 V bottom move back to the top. 

If tomorrow closes back over 405.2 I will be closing my puts, however, if we close under 405.2 and especially if we close closer to 390 I would still feel solid in my trade.

While the forecast for CPI is bullish (CPI lower then previous) the consensus is not out yet and the thing I cant get past is that EVERY fed member including JPOW today has said ‚Äúinflation has not peaked and we are not going to stop hikes.‚Äù So to me a 2nd lower inflation reading seems a big outta play for me. 

We will see what tomorrow brings and I will evaluate EOD what I plan to do. Historically CPI (2 days before) bring a massive sell off of about 2% and the week prior to FOMC brings about a 3-5% sell off so there is a reason to continue to hold my puts. I will evaluate EOD tomorrow and go from there.

I recognized pretty early today that I was not going to want to trade today (we started with a major bull trend) which I of course bought before the drop‚Ä¶ lol but over all when SPY is volatile and so wishy washy like this its better left untouched. I did, however, notice some really great setups on Apple today and was able to capitalize on that. I will look at more Apple plays as long as SPY is disconnected from Apples trend and Apple is in a trendy playable mood.

Arguably, a similar company of this potential scale and profitability never existed before. This is why the market might be currently failing to properly value the stock. In this chapter, we aim to shine some light on the true long-term potential of AST.

To quickly recap -

SpaceMobile has an attractive business model. All they have to do is develop, launch and operate a satellite constellation. SpaceMobile will then offer the satellite connectivity to existing established mobile network operators - who will likely white-label the service as their own and offer it to their existing/prospective customers in the region.

SpaceMobile will not be responsible for marketing and customer acquisition - effectively outsourcing this to their already established partners with broad customer base and highly competitive customer acquisition channels.

It will not even have to acquire cellular frequency band licenses (which cost up to tens of billions of dollars [260]). Instead, they will borrow their partner‚Äôs licenses. With 50/50 revenue share agreements (e.g. with Vodafone) in place, and with minimal capital expenses once the satellite constellation is deployed, SpaceMobile can achieve extremely high 90%+ profit margins (possibly up to 99%, as projected by the AST management for 2030).

If they can pull it off, the business model will be incredible.

The multibillion-dollar question is ‚Äì how to value the company? What is the fair value for the stock price today and in the future?

Whether you are a financial professional or not, we got you covered. We will explain some key terms and concepts necessary for valuing a growth company, and will also show how these metrics work specifically for AST.

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGET
The anatomy of valuation step-by-step
EBITDA
A fancy term for gross profit. It means ‚ÄúEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization‚Äù.
In the case of SpaceMobile with incredibly high profit margins (90-99%), its EBITDA is projected to be only slightly lower than its Revenue.
For example, in 2030, AST management projects $16.4B revenue and $16.3B EBITDA, which translates to 99% profit margin. [27] Such profit margins are almost unheard-of for a company of this size.
If AST hits the target revenue projected by its management for 2030 ($16B~), it will become one of the largest and most successful companies in the world.

What other companies generate revenue of that magnitude?

Here's one. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) generates $15.30B of revenue and is currently the world's 18th largest company with a market cap of $355B.

AST's business model is superior to Mastercard in several aspects. For example:

Mastercard has only 57%~ EBITDA margin [261] and thus generates only $12.4B~ EBITDA on $20.8B revenue. AST will be shooting for 99% EBITDA margins, which would translate to $20.6B EBITDA in Mastercard's case.

Mastercard has 11,300 employees. AST currently has 454 employees [262] and likely won't need many more than 1,000 even at peak scale.

Or, to really highlight the power of AST's ultra-high profit business model, consider The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).

While Disney generates $76.6B revenue, it has over 200,000 employees, and its EBITDA is only $10.6B. AST will need to generate less than $10.7B revenue to match Disney's EBITDA! The fact that it will need 200 times less employees and generate only 1/7 of the revenue to match Disney‚Äôs EBITDA really showcases the strength of AST's simple business model.

Market Capitalization, or Market Cap or Equity Value
It is the total number of shares multiplied by share price. 
AST has 210.8M shares outstanding total including employee incentive shares and shares exercisable for warrants [263], so if the share price is $10 for example, the market cap is $2.108B.
In the future, AST might issue more shares to get more funding or to attract or retain talent. If this happens, market cap will go higher, but the share price won‚Äôt. This is called dilution. 
Fortunately, once AST gets its first revenue, it should be able to raise capital in the form of debt instead of issuing new shares. 
Once AST grows to a sufficient scale, it should be able to repurchase shares on the open market to decrease the number of shares outstanding and to return capital to investors.

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGET
Enterprise Value (also ‚ÄúEV‚Äù)
EV is a modified market cap. To calculate enterprise value of a company, you take its market cap (or equity value, same thing), then add to it all debt the company has and subtract the cash it has. 
So, for example, if the company has a $1B market cap, $0.5B debt and $0.1B cash on its balance sheet, its enterprise value will be $1.4B. Here‚Äôs the calculation: $1B (market cap) plus $0.5B (debt) minus $0.1B (cash) equals $1.4B. 
Companies that have lots of debt and little cash will have higher EV than their market cap, and companies that have lots of cash and little debt will have lower enterprise value than their market cap. 
Why is EV widely used and considered useful? Because it gives a more accurate idea of what the company is worth ‚Äúnet‚Äù.
Imagine you are an investment bank and want to buy a whole company that has a market cap of $1B, but also $0.3B cash in its bank account and no debt. You pay $1B, but you immediately get $0.3B back, because that‚Äôs what the company has in the bank. So, you only pay $0.7B ‚Äúnet‚Äù, which equals to company‚Äôs EV. 
Or, imagine the company has a market cap of $1B but also owes $0.5B in debt. In this situation, you will need to pay not only the $1B for the company but also have to take on its debt, so you will have to pay additional $0.5B. You will pay $1.5B total, which also equals to the company‚Äôs EV.
In case of SpaceMobile, we expect it to initially have lots of debt ($1.2B or more by end of 2023), but starting from 2024, if things work out, it will be fully self-funded and will be able to repay all the debt and start accumulating and distributing cash in the form of dividends or share buybacks, even in the face of additional spending for launching additional satellites to scale with customer demand (in 2026 and beyond).
For simplicity‚Äôs sake, we can assume that long-term (say, 2027 and beyond), AST‚Äôs market cap (equity value) will be very close to its enterprise value.
Valuation Multiple
This is the magic number which allows you to calculate market cap (or enterprise value) based on the company‚Äôs revenue (or EBITDA).
It‚Äôs popular to calculate enterprise value (EV) by multiplying the company‚Äôs EBITDA with a given multiple. It is called an ‚ÄúEV/EBITDA multiple‚Äù.
So, for example, if you think a company will have $1B revenue, and you think a fair multiple for such a company is 20 times its revenue, it means you think a fair market cap for such a company is $20B.
For companies that already generate revenue, you can calculate their existing EV/EBITDA right now! For example, as of Aug 5 2022, Iridium‚Äôs EV-to-EBITDA multiple is 19.39 [264], and American Tower‚Äôs EV-to-EBITDA multiple is 25.58 [265].
And in case you were wondering, Mastercard trades at 28.34 EV/EBITDA multiple and Disney at 22 EV/EBITDA multiple.
When trying to determine a fair future value (market cap) of a company that does not yet generate revenue, you take its estimated (projected) future EBITDA and multiply it by a multiple of similar companies that already do generate EBITDA. That way, you can calculate its estimated future market cap. And if you divide that number by the number of outstanding shares the company has (or you expect it to have in the future) ‚Äì voil√† ‚Äì you just calculated its future price!
Of course, when you do that, you need to be careful in both estimating the future EBITDA correctly and choosing the right multiple by picking the most similar already revenue-generating companies as your guide. 
Now, future price calculated this way will always be higher than today‚Äôs fair price. Why? Because the company needs to grow into this valuation. It does not yet have the revenues you estimate for the future.
So how do you get today‚Äôs ‚Äúfair‚Äù price from the future price? Easy: you use the so called ‚Äúdiscount rate‚Äù.

Discount Rate or Hurdle Rate
Hurdle rate is minimum annual return an investor requires when making an investment. Investors need to get paid for all the risks (e.g., the company could fail, economy could crash) and opportunity costs (they could just invest into Apple or S&amp;P500 index fund instead) they take on.
For risky high-growth companies, investors will demand higher hurdle rates (typically 15 to 20%).
Here‚Äôs an example.
If you think that a fair stock price of a company in 10 years is $100, but you require a 20% annual return, you won‚Äôt be willing to pay $100 for it today, because then your return would be 0% for 10 years - you would just sit on it for 10 years until it grows into its valuation, and then and only then it might start growing further and you would start making a return.
Instead, you will whip out Excel and do some discounting. Discounting is basically the opposite of compounding: you start with an already compounded number ($100) and calculate the current fair price that will compound based on your hurdle rate (20%) each year.
Excel has a handy function called PV (Present Value) which allows you to calculate just this - today‚Äôs value from future value [266]. 
If you input =PV(20%,10,0,-100) into a cell, the output will be $16. That‚Äôs the today‚Äôs fair value in our example!  (The entered inputs specify: you have a 20% hurdle rate, there are 10 compounding periods, you will receive no dividend each year and the future stock price after the 10 years will be $100).
So even though you think the stock price will be worth $100 in the future, because you want to make at least 20% per year, you shouldn‚Äôt pay more than $16 for it today. If it seems low, consider the power of compounding: If a $16 stock compounds by 20% for 10 years, it will cost $100 on year 10. It will go like this each year: $16 (today; year zero), $19 (year 1), $23 (year 2‚Ä¶), $28, $33, $40, $48, $58, $69, $83, $100 (year 10).
Putting it all together: Naive ASTS valuation example
We will get to explaining our own more advanced model soon, but we know you can‚Äôt wait, so let‚Äôs try the valuation exercise above with some extremely optimistic AST numbers and a 20% discount rate.

Assuming AST will hit the 2030 $16.3B EBITDA as projected by its management [27] (which is unlikely), won‚Äôt dilute its shares beyond 210.8M, will trade at a 22x multiple, then: its 2030 share price will be $1740 and today‚Äôs fair price is $387. This means that if the assumptions come true, the stock should be trading about 170 times higher in 2030 from an $10¬± entry price.

The calculation is straightforward: $16.3B EBITDA times 22 (valuation multiple) equals $358.6B market cap. Divided by 210.8M (0.2108B) shares equals $1,701 future share price.

This is the most naive and most aggressive bull case that can be possibly made today.

However, this scenario is both too simple and unrealistic. For example, it's already almost certain that AST's revenue will be delayed by at least a year compared to original management's projections. Also, in 2020, AST management couldn't have possibly accounted for Starlink and T-Mobile's market entry, so its projections need to be revised for this reason as well.

So let‚Äôs now think about how we can make our valuation model better: more conservative, realistic, comprehensive and also account for unforeseen circumstances (regulatory blockages, risk of total failure, new unexpected competitors, etc.)

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGET
How do others value AST?
Let‚Äôs take a look at how the company was already valued by: AST management in the original presentation for SPAC investors [27], Deutsche bank [83], and Barclays [267]. We will consider some of the shortcomings of these three models and ultimately present our own more comprehensive model.

Valuation models	AST Management	Deutsche Bank	Barclays
Date released	December 2020	June 2021	July 2021
Rating	N/A	Buy	Overweight
12-month price target	N/A	$35	$29
12-month upside target	N/A	$86	$37.50
EV valuation multiple	14x	15-25x for 2024; 10x for 2030 (conservative; ‚Äúillustrative‚Äù purposes)	21x (EV/net profit)
Shares outstanding estimate	181.55M	210.8M	181.53M
Valuation based on	2024E EBITDA	2024E EBITDA	2024 net profit + 2031 cashflow model (50/50)
Subscriber estimate	620M by 2030	27% lower for 2026	55% lower for 2030
Revenue per subscriber estimate	$2.21 by 2030	9% lower	25% lower
CAPEX estimate	$1.7B by 2023
$3.32B total by 2028	$2.2B by 2026
No estimate for 2028	$3.7B total by 2028
Discount rate used	20%	15%	20%
Deutsche Bank‚Äôs model is based on 2024 estimates and on 4 different scenarios: ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù (optimistic), conservative (‚ÄúDeutsche bank‚Äù), even more conservative, and total failure. They give 25% probability to each one. In our opinion, the 25% probability of a total failure is too pessimistic.

Barclays are actually using two different models ‚Äì one based on discounted cashflow (2031) and another based on net profit multiple (2024). They give 50% weight to each of these models to calculate their final target.

The key limitation of all of the three valuation models is working with 2024 numbers only. AST expects explosive growth in 2025 (160%), 2026 (120%) and 2027 (66%) [27] ‚Äì this should be taken into consideration! (To give credit where credit is due, Barclays are actually working with 2031 estimates in their cashflow model.)

None of these analyses give predictions for future (2027-2031) stock price. Wall Street analysts typically focuses only on the next 12 months. For a hyper-growth company with a tremendous long-term potential like AST, this short-term perspective is myopic and insufficient, especially for long-term investors.

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGET
Determining the valuation multiple
No company like AST SpaceMobile is currently publicly traded, so we need to be a bit creative when determining the most comparable companies to figure out the right EV/EBITDA valuation multiple for AST.

In the investor presentation [27], AST management team draws comparison to Satellite, Space Tourism, Telecom, Cable, Cell Tower, Electric Vehicle, 3D Printing and LiDAR companies to determine the multiple.

We don‚Äôt agree with this approach.

AST is a company that intends to launch satellites to orbit to function as cell towers, while offering its services to network operators (not directly to consumers). Only the segments of ‚ÄúSatellite‚Äù and ‚ÄúTowers‚Äù are relevant, since that‚Äôs what SpaceMobile is - a satellite cell tower operator. Not a mobile operator. Not a cable company. Not a space tourism company, and definitely not an electric vehicle manufacturer.

Deutsche Bank and Barclays don‚Äôt repeat this mistake, and consider only satellite companies.

We think that‚Äôs an improvement. However, cell tower companies should be included in the comparison as well.

Now let‚Äôs take a look at some publicly traded satellite operators and how they differ from AST. We consider most of these to be ""legacy"" players.

Iridium Communications (IRDM)
Iridium, which we already talked about in the Competition section of this report, is the most obvious comparison choice, because it provides voice and data services to hand-held satellite phones. (Key distinction: satellite phones, which are expensive and clunky. They are nothing like the phone you already have in your pocket.)
Iridium's growth is projected to be less than 10% annually, whereas AST management expects 17% growth even in 2030.
Iridium has $1.6B debt (this will be comparable to AST) and $5.77B market cap. Its EBITDA margin is 56.88% - in comparison, AST projects 95-99%.
Notably, due to high depreciation &amp; amortisation, Iridium is currently not profitable at all.
Equipment sales and engineering services are about 20% of Iridium's revenue, which is another difference with AST.
Iridium operates a LEO constellation, which makes it more similar to AST than GEO satellite companies.
ARK Invest, an innovation-focused asset manager, owns 1.72% of all outstanding Iridium stock (down from 10%). ARK Invest requires minimum 15% hurdle rate for its positions, so we can surmise that ARK still considers Iridium sufficiently innovative and expects 15% or higher growth from it. AST is also a highly innovative, high-growth company.
Viasat (VSAT)
Viasat operates GEO satellites providing high-speed broadband services. Its customers require expensive satellite dishes.
It is currently not profitable.
It has $2.87B debt, $2.5B market cap. ($5B enterprise value)
The biggest positive of the company is that a revenue growth of over 10% is estimated.

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGET
Eutelsat (ETL.PA)
Eutelsat is primarily in the television and radio broadcasting business.
It has declining revenue.
One redeeming aspect of the company is that it owns 19.3% stake in OneWeb [269], one of the main Starlink competitors we discussed earlier, currently deploying its satellites (with over 250 already deployed) in preparation of commercial service.
SES S.A. (SESG)
SES is a Luxembourg-based satellite operator. It derives 60% of its revenue from video distribution and services ‚Äì a very different business than AST.
40% of its revenue is connectivity from MEO satellites.
It‚Äôs barely growing with 3.7% revenue growth, but it is currently profitable.
Orbcomm (ORBC)
Orbcomm is not a pure-play satellite operator. It provides industrial IoT hardware, software, connectivity and other services.
Satellite connectivity is likely only about half or less of its revenue [270].
During its 2021 stock price peak, it had the highest EV/EBITDA multiple among satellite companies, 24.30x.
However, it got acquired in September 2021 and went private, so we have no visibility into its current financial numbers.
Intelsat (INTEQ)
Intelsat went recently bankrupt [271] with over $15B in debt, so we won't be using it in our comparisons.
There is currently no directly comparable satellite business. Although still notably different than AST, we think that Iridium (handheld satellite phones) and Viasat (fixed broadband internet) are the most comparable ones, so we will use them.

We will also include the three largest cell tower operators.

Below are our choices of companies to use, with current EV/EBITDA multiples taken from GuruFocus.com on Aug 5, 2022 [264]:

COMMUNICATION / BROADBAND SATELLITES
Iridium	IRDM	19.39x
Viasat	VSAT	10.05x
CELL TOWERS
American Tower International, Inc.	AMT	25.48x
Crown Castle International	CCI	27.03x
SBA Communications Corporation	SBAC	35.67x
The average multiple for the two chosen satellite companies is 14.72x, while the average tower company multiple is 29.39x. Averaging these two already combined multiples gives us 22x. This is also slightly higher than IRDM, which seems reasonable to us.

Based on the above, the 14x (2024) multiple chosen by the AST management team seems too low. That said, market valuations were lower across the board when they were preparing the presentation, which explains most of this discrepancy.

The 15x (conservative) and 25x (upside scenario) multiples chosen by Deutsche Bank seem reasonable to us. It‚Äôs worth noting that Deutsche Bank is estimating the multiples for 2024 only. For 2030, it mentions a possible 10x ‚Äúconservative‚Äù multiple for illustrative purposes. The main reason an investor might believe 2030 multiple should be lower than a 2024 multiple is slower growth of the company. However, we believe that AST should be able to sustain a 10%+ growth even beyond 2030, which is in line with cell tower companies and most existing satellite operators. This should support a 22x multiple.

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGET
Projected EBITDA
Projected EBITDA is arguably the most important component of the valuation model.

In the case of AST, its projected revenue is:

Number of Subscribers times Average Monthly Revenue Per Subscriber times 12.

SpaceMobile expects the following average monthly revenue per customer [27]:

US &amp; Europe	Equatorial	Global
$7.62	$1.03	$1.99
The table above represents SpaceMobile share of the revenue under 50/50 revenue share agreements, so from that we can imply the average monthly cost of the service to end-users (which will

be purchasing the service from their local mobile network operators):

US &amp; Europe	Equatorial	Global
$15.24	$2.06	$3.98
It‚Äôs possible that AST will get higher than 50% revenue share in same markets, but this is currently not disclosed and speculative, so we will not be including that possibility in our model.

The numbers above are averages, and SpaceMobile plans to offer various packages (daily pass, monthly pass, etc.), so some packages will be priced below the average and some will be priced above the average. The prices do look quite affordable though, and even the lowest income equatorial households can probably afford the service for at least one device.

SpaceMobile expects to have the following number of subscribers (in millions) [27]:

 	Equatorial	Rest of the world	Total
2023	5	4	9
2024	17	27	44
2025	41	67	108
2026	81	153	234
2027	115	258	373
2028	136	332	467
2029	156	375	531
2030	180	440	620
This is a very rapid initial growth when expressed in YoY rates:

 	Equatorial	Rest of the world	Total
2024	240 %	575 %	389 %
2025	141 %	148 %	145 %
2026	98 %	128 %	117 %
2027	42 %	67 %	59 %
2028	18 %	30 %	25 %
2029	15 %	13 %	14 %
2030	15 %	17 %	17 %
While such growth rates might seem high at first, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind how SpaceMobile plans to acquire the subscribers. For the equatorial region (Phase 1), multiple mobile network operators in 49 countries will be simultaneously advertising the service to 730M unconnected people and up to 1.6B people in total [272,27].

United Nations project 8.5B world population by 2030 [273]. 620M subscribers represent 7.3% or world population then, and would position AST as company with a truly civilisational scale and importance. While this number might seem mind-boggling, it‚Äôs still only a single digit market penetration!

VALUATION AND PRICE TARGET
AST aims for rapid growth. Given the sheer number of people living in the equatorial region and the chosen strategy that allows to enter the markets rapidly and without friction, it seems achievable. Most of the equatorial market is already accessible to SpaceMobile thanks to Vodafone and other signed partners.

The global subscriber growth rate correlates with equatorial growth rate. One notable exception is the 2024 YoY growth rate of almost 600%. This is caused by Phase 2 and Phase 3 launch of 90 satellites, scheduled for 2023-2024, increasing the coverage for rest of the world substantially.

From the average revenue per user and the number of expected users, what follows is AST‚Äôs management original forward-looking income statement (in millions of USD) [27]:

AST‚Äôs high EBITDA profit margin of up to 99% is realistic given the business model. Owning and operating a satellite communications company, and selling services that people want and need, is where the real money is in space. [274]

While we think that the revenue numbers projected by AST management are possible, our own projections are more conservative (see below).

 	2021	2022	2023	2024	2025	2026	2027	2028	2029	2030

Free Cash Flow	-159	-697	-797	1 014	2 560	5 651	8 922	11 367	13 960	16 307
The green-highlighted CapEx represents the cost for buildup and launch of the Phase 1-4 of equatorial and global satellite constellation ($1.7B~).

The blue-highlighted CapEx represents construction and launch of additional ‚ÄúMIMO‚Äù satellites to grow with demand ($1.6B~).

The yellow-highlighted cell is the basis of valuation chosen by the SPAC team before the reverse merger. (As you can see, if they selected a cell more to the right, the SPAC merger valuation would‚Äôve been much higher. This is good for investors.)

For valuation purposes, the 2030 EBITDA  ($16.3B) is the most important metric from above.

Transhumanica interactive AST valuation model
We created an interactive ASTS stock valuation model. It‚Äôs embedded into this report (see below) and also hosted on our website.

We open-sourced it via GitHub, for the benefit of global investor community.

The model allows you to configure the following parameters based on your own views:

EV/EBITDA multiple
Number of projected subscribers
Competitive pressure (what % of the projected subscribers will be lost to competition?)
Regulatory hurdles (what % of the projected subscribers won't be reachable due to regulatory bottlenecks?)
Revenue per subscriber
Operational expenses
Net debt or cash by 2030
Shares outstanding (will the company have to dilute shares - OR - will they already start buying them back?)
Risk of total failure
Discount rate (also known as Hurdle Rate. What % return do you require from your investment? This determines today's fair value of the stock.)
Initial stock price (to calculate CAGR upside; by default, it‚Äôs the current market price)
We allow you to choose from a list of possible scenarios for each parameter based on your optimism or pessimism, and provide an explanation of what each scenario means. When changing the individual parameters, you can see how this affect the 2030 target price in real-time.

We recommend that you go through all options on every parameter to develop your understanding.

For each parameter, we suggest Transhumanica scenario, which is more conservative than AST management‚Äôs scenario. When available, we also provide Deutsche Bank and Barclays scenarios as an option.

Finally, you can also set an entirely custom value for every parameter.

We plan to keep updating the model based on Transhumanica community feedback and new data as it emerges.

If you have suggestions for improvements of our model, please contact us at feedback@transhumanica.com

Transhumanica 2030 ASTS price target
Our 2030 ASTS price target is $514. At 20% discount rate, today‚Äôs fair stock value is $114.

With an entry point at $12.00, the 2030 price target represents a 58% CAGR opportunity and 4,283% (42.8x) total return opportunity.

As of today, the market is significantly undervaluing and underestimating the company. Two large catalysts on the horizon, which could materially move the stock price, are successful BlueWalker-3 launch (est. mid-September 2022 [58]) and subsequent validation of the technology (which will be a multi-month process following the launch), and potentially a grant of subsidy from US 5G Fund (which could come unexpectedly).

We want to re-iterate that there is a non-zero risk of total failure of the company and thus a total loss of investor capital. For this reason, you should never allocate your whole portfolio to ASTS. In fact, never invest into ""binary bets"" like ASTS more than you can comfortably fully lose without it affecting your lifestyle. Finally, as a repeated friendly reminder, none of this is financial advice.

&gt;Stocks rose the most in about a month as Treasury yields paused their rise to multiyear highs, as traders digested remarks from a slew of Federal Reserve speakers. Oil fell, alleviating concerns about price pressures that could jeopardize the central bank's war on inflation.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Every major group in the S&amp;P 500 except energy rose, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, with only four members in the red. Apple rose after unveiling the latest version of its flagship product, the iPhone 14, relying on camera upgrades and a new emergency satellite-messaging feature to fend off rivals.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Oil benchmarks fell as demand concerns from China triggered a wave of selling as prices breached technical warning levels. West Texas Intermediate closed at less than $82 per barrel, while Brent closed at $88. The dollar fell following a rally that shook currencies around the world and briefly pushed gold below the ""danger zone"" of $1,700 per ounce.

I think everyone wanted a trend day but everyone wanted/ expected a bearish trend day not a bullish trend day. If you were able to shake your bearish bias there was a lot of money to be made today. 

The trend of green open= red day and red open= green day so far holds true‚Ä¶

One of the strongest 15min bull channels ive seen in a while.

While I am overall bearish still, there is now a potential V-bottom forming on the SPY daily chart. 

Key support remains at 391.9 for that ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù support line and key resistance for the downward red bear channel remains at 398.2 tomorrow. 

With only 2 1%+ green days in the last 16 trading days this is a much needed oversold bounce to reset the indicators and allow for the next leg down. Especially if you read my last night TA where I showed the probability that end of week and next week are red due to CPI/ FOMC (we still have no cpi consensus‚Ä¶).

If we break the red bear channel down I will get nervous about my 14dte puts, however, if we were to hold the blue resistance line from the 430 top I would not be as worried. There is a nice setup to have a similar trend as August 25th/ 26th with a nice 398 double top forming tomorrow. If markets are setting up similarly to the Jackson hole where they rallied into JPOW speaking only to dump like crazy intraday (he speaks at 910am) we could see a similar move tomorrow. However, there if of course always a chance we see a bigger bounce green and could retest 405 by EOW.

One of the major bearish things is that the daily 8ema was not broken‚Ä¶ I think the correct thesis remains bearish as long as that daily 8ema holds as resistance. 

Key support remains- 391.9 and 390.4

Key resistance remains- 398.2 and 405.2

https://preview.redd.it/bmd3idb8yhm91.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0328db8ab4919d733bf5f59aa6763aebc1963b8d

SPY weekly continues to hold that blue 13 week long recovery line (despite futures/ apple breaking theirs). We are still looking at a downward bear channel on the weekly which could give a potential bounce back to 412.4 (unlikely honestly) this week. 

Another thing to keep an eye on is the current 392.1 weekly candle double bottom that is attempting to form. 

https://preview.redd.it/q0c7llx8yhm91.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be406cfa2f379b03e6e8e3c0db23b396c5501bf

Futures daily does not actually show the same v-bottom recovery as SPY. It just shows a near support bounce off that 3883 area to retest daily 8ema resistance before the next leg down. 

Key support- 3872

Key resistance- 3988 and 4000

https://preview.redd.it/f2jyhhh9yhm91.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de98c728b3462d311d32528a09eb3f5e9f6015a

Futures weekly is also showing a possible weekly double bottom at 3923 forming if we were to not visit the lows before Fridays market close. 

Weekly resistance for this bear channel is 4000 tomorrow with next weekly level resistance at 4025. 

Weekly support is 3900 then 3828.

Apple continues to remain the wild child. Intraday today and yesterday apple actually showed extreme weakness compared to the overall market and SPY. With apple only putting in a 0.93% green day compared to SPYs 1.8% green day Apple lagged most of the day. 

I believe part of that reason is that there was no sellers today on SPY hitting under 70mil currently with only 104% of the 30day average volume vs. Apple hitting 87mil and 127% of 30day average. Apple had a lot of sellers today. 

I was looking to see if Apple would close its back to back days under the daily 200ema, however, EOD it was able to pop its head over that resistance and couldn‚Äôt quite break down there. 

We saw a pretty healthy rejection at 156.5 today and we will continue to look at that as resistance. 

Key support- 155.5 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 152.2

Key resistance- 156.5 -&gt; 158.9 (red bear channel)

https://preview.redd.it/qx4jpjoayhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7b99fc4afa9d4db3561285570ef22bfa59292

Apples weekly chart continues to remain bearish. It shows that there is room for a potential pump as high as even 161 without breaking that bearish trend down. However, we should look for the weekly 20ema at 157 and weekly 8ema at 159.5 to be heavy resistance if we see upward movement. 

Key support remains at 154 and if we were to break 154 I would be looking for 150. 

https://preview.redd.it/qo8ol5abyhm91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935dc72646b736e38f711f59fd84a945ab70dee9

VIX had a pretty large 8.44% sell off day today on this very green market day. It still is holding the recovery channel upward with a trajectory for the 30s. Key level to watch tomorrow remains at 24.3. If that holds and they close it back over 25.5 that would put things back on track for a bigger sell off eow and next week. 

I will be posting my CPI breakdown post later tonight. If you read it you will see that I am overall bearish for Friday this week and the rest of next week as historically the week prior to FOMC is a big red week (with previous FOMC the only outlier).

I am still holding this put and I did average it down after closing bell today. I still see a bigger sell off to come within the next two weeks (most of it happening next week). I do not have plans to average this down again. 

https://preview.redd.it/u1c4guacyhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c03603d12588f70a7dfd769d2890e4650ab44766

Tomorrow, we get yet another jobs report and as I said JPOW speaks ‚Äúat the CATO institutes 40th annual monetary conference.‚Äù What is he going to say? Im not sure but if its anything like Jackon Hole the market is not going to like it. With no CPI forecast still I still forsee a bearish tone from JPOW. There has not been a bullish fed member to speak in a very long time. And finally markets are actually listening to what JPOW is saying. Tomorrows opening is going to be SPICY‚Ä¶

Overall a great day for me today. Took a loss on that put when I suspected we were going to see a sell off around 1215 when we broke then 15min 8ema. Other then that I didn‚Äôt trade much after 1230 as while I clear saw the bull trend day and that it most likely after that 1215a bounce was not going to break‚Ä¶ I had a lot of trust in it and chose to just sit cash instead of trading something I had no conviction in.

493,1662565929,x88ncu,1,"Apple is widely expected to give a first look at its latest iPhone lineup on Wednesday, as the tech giant has done every year in September for about a decade.

The latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It‚Äôs rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model ‚Äì meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.

Finally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company‚Äôs flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.

It‚Äôs not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday‚Äôs event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.

Apple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple‚Äôs bigger breakout successes in recent years.

Apple‚Äôs event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: ‚ÄúFar out.‚Äù 

This has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.

While the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.

Many analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.

Apple‚Äôs stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.

But with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales ‚Äî and all the subscription revenue that comes with that ‚Äî be enough to turn Apple‚Äôs stock from red to green?

Investors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. 

Analysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world‚Äôs most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.

The company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.

One analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That's because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.
Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple's initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with ""macro storm clouds building."" So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.
""This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years,"" Ives added.
Apple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.
According to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

For the AAPL fanbois who have religiously followed the company, there was a rumor that another company--GT Advanced Technologies--would be contracted by Apple to produce Sapphire Glass Screens for the front of that generation's iphone.   


When the iPhone announcement came, there was no mention of Sapphire Glass, and GT Advanced Technologies crashed.   


There's a non-zero change that GSAT will suffer a similar fate.

Looking at the option chain for GSAT, the 09/09 2P Vega is very small.

Assuming the implied volatility falls back to the \~200% level, that represents a 140 point drop. Multiplied by the vega of 0.001, represents $0.14 / share of the 09/09 2P value. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order to overcome that $0.14 / share drop due to IV crush, the price of the stock would need to move about 0.36 to \~$1.77. 

Divide the price move attributed to IV crush by the delta.  


0.14 / -0.383 = -$0.365  


$2.14 - $0.365 = $1.775

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you think the price of GSAT will be below $1.775 after the announcement, you should buy 09/09 2P.

Today we finally saw the 13 week long recovery support line from the June low/ v-bottom break on SPY. This is the same trend line we saw break last Friday on Apple. 

With this trend line broken AND bears finally closing a candle below 391 support and also breaking down to 388.42 intraday today I am officially bearish. I am also bearish due to CPI and FOMC that are coming up soon. Lets talk chart technical and then end of this I will tell you why I am bearish fomc/ cpi and what position I am in because of it. 

SPY daily has a nice falling wedge forming right now (black solid lines) this falling wedge gives us a support tomorrow at 387.8 and a resistance of 394.1 (todays HOD). There are fairly high odds that we will see this falling wedges support broken later this week. 

Key resistance now will remain at 391 tomorrow as that is the major daily resistance level that we have to watch and that took 3 trading days to finally close below. 

We are still trading within that red bear channel which gives support tomorrow at 382 (-2.2% from close) and gives resistance of 401.1 (+2.6%). Until we see the red bear channel resistance line broken I would hesitate to go long here on calls especially since we broke into the 380s today.

Spy weekly we did perfectly hold support on that 13 week long weekly bull support line, however, in later you see that Apple and Futures both broke this support so SPY should be to follow next. I mentioned that we should play level to level on SPY now. With the 390 level being breached and the 380s being seen for the first time since middle of July we now are set up in the current trajectory to see 360s-370s by end of September. 

Key support is now 390.3 on the weekly chart from there the next major support is 367.1 which is the weekly 200ema. The weekly 200ema is where we bounce aggressively off in June. 

Key resistance will be at 396.5 for this week followed by 402.2.

Similar story as you may expect with futures. We broke under 3900 today for the first time since July 19th. However, as of now the bears were unable to close under key support of 3900. We did see a break down of the 13 week long v-bottom bull support line today also. This should lead to a bearish movement going forward. 

Key supports to watch is 3900 -&gt; 3883 (the black solid falling wedge) -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3816.

Key resistance to watch is 3925 -&gt; 3944 (black falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 4025.

Here is that weekly futures support line breakdown I was speaking about above. With this line being broken that is incredibly bearish longer term. With this support line being broken this gives rise to test support at 3827 and 3676 (weekly 200ema). I will be watching for futures to finally close under 3900 this week and that will be the longer term signal that 3600s are coming again. 

Key resistance remains at 4000 this week. Until this week breaks 4000 I will remain bearish.

Apple actually had a fairly bearish day today now only short term but long term. With a close below the daily 200ema for the first time since July this should be a very bearish omen for the future.

Key support remains at 153.2 (falling wedge black solid lines) and then 150 (-3%) for the red bear channel support. 

Key resistance is 156 (black falling wedge resistance line) and then 160.3 (+3.6%) for the red bear channel resistance.

The Apple charts weekly is actually kinda crazy to look at. When you think about the fact that Apple really has survived the best of all the stocks out there (for the most part) its natural that it has the most downside to expect too. The weekly is in a clear downward cycle that looks just like March. With this current downward channel I can expect a possibility that Apple COULD reach 120s by October on the current trajectory. 

With the weekly 13 week long bull support line being broken I fully anticipate further downside on Apple the rest of the week and month.

The VIX continues to find support and continues to make new highs. Today we actually made a new recent high again. We backtested the 8ema support and also 25.5 support and held that. We also managed to close over key 26.8 resistance from last week. The VIX appears to be on a trajectory for 30+ which makes a lot of sense when you factor in CPI next Tuesday the 13th and FOMC in 15 days on the 21st. 

Speaking of CPI and FOMC‚Ä¶ let me tell you how I am positioned and how I am playing this.

I alerted this today and here is why. This is the week before CPI and historically (you guys know I love my historic trends) there is usually a 2 days sell off prior to CPI. In the past 5 CPIs we are actually averaging a total drop of about 2.5% over the two days leading up to CPI. In addition the week before CPI (which is also next week) is averaging a intraweek drop of -2.86% through the week with two of those having a 5%+ drop. If you don‚Äôt factor in the last FOMC (the only time we were green the week before FOMC) then we are actually averaging a -4.23% drop the week prior to FOMC. 

With this info you can see how it‚Äôs a pretty good odds that we are going to see a sell off EOW here and next week should be red due to the historical trend. Now here is something even more suspicious about this CPI‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

Historically the CPI forecast and consensus is released well ahead of the actual CPI reading. The last CPI I know they released CPI about 2-3 week before the physical CPI reading happened. I know in the last there were times it was released just shortly after the previous CPI also. The fact that there is no release of this CPI, the president says inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked, technically month over month CPI was 0% so it too didn‚Äôt drop just didn‚Äôt go up, all the fed members screaming inflations not peaked, and daddy JPOW himself at the Jackson hole saying inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked and rate hikes haven‚Äôt stopped‚Ä¶ I have a feeling this consensus/ forecast has purposefully not been released yet. I think when they release it the number is going to be way higher then the previous 8.5% and when that happens markets are going to panic and we are going to see a very similar June 8th to June 13th CPI drop of 10% in 5 days. 

I personally believe we are seeing the bear storm forming and the eye of the hurricane is here right now.

I opened this put today. I will hold this put until we break the red resistance of this bear market. If we test and reject the red resistance line I will average this put down. Otherwise I will let this one ride. 

I tactfully chose September 21st expiration as that is the FOMC meeting and my goal would be to close this either the Friday before FOMC or the day before FOMC depending on how markets have behaved and reacted to CPI. Another potential take profits are will be 370 as that will be a major support line too.

After last weeks frustration I decided to go down to about a $1000/ position with a -20% stop loss and a 20% take profit set on all orders. I also watch the stochs and whenever I see the stochs hit overbought (if im in call) or over sold (if in puts) on the 1min when im scalping I exit no matter where I am profit wise. 

Today was a much needed day for me mentally. The biggest change I made today though besides a slightly smaller position size was that I no longer hesitated in a play. I often found myself waiting and waiting and waiting for all the confirmations only to find I missed the bigger move. Today when I saw the setup and the trend aligned with my strategy I didn‚Äôt let fear stop me from entering. If it met my criteria I entered and it worked really well for me today. I truly look forward to the rest of the week trading now.

499,1662472769,x7bcg6,1,"Globalstar, an American based satellite communications company looks to be primed for an absolute launch with all of the rumors flying around. 

A mystery customer has been in collaboration with them for a long time now. It looks to be Apple, but not the iPhone that is connecting to the Globalstar constellation. It's the Apple Watch that will likely be released on Wednesday during the Apple ""Event"".

Want evidence? Go to:

https://www.taoglas.com/datasheets/SP.1615.25.4.A.02.pdf

What do you see?

1) A TaoGlas patch antenna specifically designed to work with Globalstar's uplink spectrum at 1615MHz =/- 3MHz. It is 25mmX25mmX4mm, i.e. it would fit in the Apple Watch with room for the the STX3 (or similar) uplink transmitter inside. See pg. 11. (It might also fit inside a modern iPhone with current 3GPP R16 or higher.)

2) Apple Watch, e.g. FCC ID ""BCG-A2475"". Bluetooth operates at 2480MHz, just 3.5MHz below n53 and likely overlapping it. This will be the downlink band, which at some point can be flipped on via a 3GPP software patch, consistent with its chipset and the new satellite connectivity feature. The patch antenna will likely be able to pick up this signal up as well, since it is LTE modulated and WCDMA compatible, the same as Globalstar's satellites. See the FCC UNII test report for the Apple Watch, Section 2.6.

3) UNII is specified at a center frequency of 5180MHz, well within the upper 100MHz of Globalstar's uplink feeder link. That means any WiFi transmissions in the band would be picked by and forwarded to the terrestrial grid. If not in the vicinity of a WiFi AP, the Watch signal - pointed at the sky - could also be picked up by the uplink feederlink receiver on the Globalstar satellites.

The beauty of this design is that the iPhone (any modern version) will be able to link to the Watch via Bluetooth and send and receive text messages (and data) from the Globalstar constellation similar to how the SpotX currently works relaying messages from Bluetooth connected devices.

502,1662412010,x6rc8o,1," I just want to post this about my feelings regarding GSAT's future and the constant comparisons that GSAT can't compete and its satellites are just so old and their new satellites aren't going to compete is not being truthful about GSAT and its possibilities at this time in my opinion.The new 17 satellites will not be simple clones of the ones we have now. It's frankly simplistic to say so. The newer satellites will no doubt have higher capacities then todays current satellites have. Why? Technology has changed from 15 to 20 years ago. Are not our phones and laptops having significantly higher performance from so long ago? All chips made today are much higher in performance so it stands to reason so will our new 17 satellites being planned as we wait. Just so the board knows: GSAT's current constellation as it currently exists handled  1,800,000,000 messages a year. Read that on GSAT's website! More capacity is coming soon as the newer satellites are launched and put into use as I do not see Apple and GSAT settling for 20 year old technology. Everything has gotten smaller, faster and higher capacity over the last 20 years and so will our next generation satellites in my opinion, it just makes sense.  GSAT has the spectrum in the S-Band and C -Band to handle much more traffic than it does now. Uplink: L-Band (1610-1618.725 MHz)Downlink: S-Band (2483.5-2500 MHz)Terrestrial: S-Band (2483.5-2500 MHz)Uplink: C-Band (5091-5250 MHz)Downlink: C-Band (6875-7055 MHz)\*\* Above from the GSAT website 2021 PresentationNoticer the S-band: it can be used as a satellite downlink and we have the right to use it here terrestrially as well.There is no FCC filings that I know of that seeks to change any of the above.

# Going to the second quarters earnings release shows a company truly getting ready to fire on all cylinders.  Why:  The recognition and release of the large IOT order of 23K devices with the likely purchase of additional devices. As GSAT advised this is likely to be a breakthrough for additional contracts and sales to other companies. They have made significant hire's in the IOT field which in my opinion have already paid off.  This regarding production issues from the 2nd quarter release:  As we resume production over the coming days and weeks, we expect equipment revenue to be meaningfully higher in the second half of 2022, leading to further subscriber revenue growth. Demand, particularly for Commercial IoT service and products, has not faltered even in the face of material supply issues. Sales orders continue to build at an impressive pace, and we will fulfill these orders expeditiously. Band 53/N53 GSAT is pending to release of additional approvals to bring the total of over one billion pops. Greater the number of POPs the greater value. We know there is a term sheet involving Band 53/N53. We already know that this will lead to an increase in GSAT's value, we just don't when the agreement will be released. I can't see the release lasting much beyond the new year, likely sooner imo.  Also, we know they are actively refinancing the debt of the company and for the capital they need for the new constellation of satellites.  Last but not least: we have the filing for a brand new constellation of 3080 satellites with the ITU from I believe their German subsidiary. That constellation they have applied for would be the same size of Amazons potential project Kuiper. Large enough to compete with anyone!  And so we additionally wait to see if Apple will the other terms agreement entity. Will they buy us out or make payments, we don't know and we won't until the announcement is made.  However, without recognition of the payments made to one of the terms agreements, GSAT had 23% higher revenue 2nd quarter. With the above sectors all coming online should show increasingly higher revenues and 4th quarter should be the first actual profit I have seen the company have since I've been here, imo. And it will not be any larger number for the profit but if GSAT manages to pull it off it will lead to a change with any partners for IOT as companies want to make sure they are with a company that will still be in business.  This is why I am very bullish on the long run prospects of GSAT and/or anyone who purchases GSAT.  Let's remember, Starlink has nothing to show and no approvals to even do what they say they want to.  GSAT has been doing everything for the last 10 years and has regulatory approval for it all right now: VOICE/TEXT/IOT.   I think its important to note that all GSAT or anyone else is talking about is moving data: bits and bytes - he digital world as we know it. No matter who partners with GSAT or buys GSAT - it's only moving data and it is beyond me to think that if any Computer company buys GSAT that the engineers are not capable to make this work. Especially Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.   So yes I am tired hearing this can't be done or Starlink is the only one that can. All Starlink has right now is a name and thats it: No VOICE/IOT/TEXT. No regulatory approvals to do so. No application or software to make it so. No reason to fear them if we get a major technology company to partner with us or buy us.  What we will all have to do is wait for the NDA's to expire or permit GSAT to announce the partners or buyout and off we go. I hope.",GSAT,1.0,2022-09-05 21:06:50

If you had taken my call out you woulda reaped the rewards had you sold immediately at open. However, despite the pretty amazingly bullish morning we had (after the $3 sell off) we put in a big resistance today and from there it was an elevator to the bottom. 

https://preview.redd.it/b314vjnxfjl91.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f25a1cff8012d85f03b285aba7cd80ef520786

Todays and yesterdays intraday charts are pretty much polar opposites of each other. 

https://preview.redd.it/845zva8yfjl91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d8cc35aafc174bee33ea39e3e341f90d9fee79f

There is a lot of bearish about this chart, however, there is also a lot of bullish about it too. 

Lets talk about the bullishness of this week and this chart. 

Spy just had a 13 day sell off for a nice $41.69 drop or 10.7%. 

Lets reference back to last weeks weekly TA for a second here‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/x39oaasyfjl91.png?width=742&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0eaba5c66d5ca54713f88dd4b9cfba318ba4c46

So we are 2 days and 2.6% (379.9 potential low) from the average drop from highs during this bear market. That then brings up the question of are we at the end of this sell off or is there more to go? 

Yesterdays sell off was the result of 390/391 support holding up stoutly and providing a massive bounce. That 391 level is a key support level on the daily that spy has established in 2022. With yesterdays bounce off 390 and then todays bounce off 390 I actually am suspecting a small bounce next week. With the failure two days in a row to break through 390 that is showing that it is going to take a bit more to break through this level. As I have mentioned before we are at a spot where we can play spy level to level. This 391 level refusing to break actually infers we should make a run back for 405.2 next. 

Today intraday there was a lot to be said that we might actually see a run back to 405.2 today or Tuesday (no trading Monday), however, 401.4 put in extreme tough resistance and due to some news about oil supply (as far as I can tell‚Ä¶ see tweet below) markets went in to a massive 3.5 hour $11.23 nose dive. 

https://preview.redd.it/4mb1jxezfjl91.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15e4cb4f66422c2e2810710213bd0fbfeae577f9

However, despite that massive sell off there was still a failure to break through 390 EOD and even a bigger pop EOD. 

https://preview.redd.it/sctb6q20gjl91.png?width=815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07c565d662d1465c308f21fe7097b7d4da680275

Looking at SPY weekly you can see that we bounced right off key 390 weekly support. Holding that will provide some upside and until we break and close below that 390 level there is more upside to be expected. 

The current resistance line from this sell off sits at 395.9 for next week and support will be at 390. From 390 we have the recovery support line at 388.9. If we see 388.9 fail next week that would be a bigger signal of a sell off possibly back to the lows in the 360s. 

If you see that purple line that utilizes the March high and June low to project a possible sell off if we see the same sort of sell off. This gives us a bear trajectory of 332 by October 31st if we were to see the same sell off as March to June. 

Overall looking at this chart and knowing that CPI is on September 13th (Tuesday) and that usually the markets start to price in CPI about 3 days before. If we are under the same sort of scenario I would for see a small move up to 405.2 early next week and we end the week on Friday with a bigger sell off. This would then lead into a sell off into the week of CPI. If we were to see a bad CPI (as of now there is still no prediction or forescast) that could accelerate a sell off down to 360s before FOMC, however, a good CPI would start a rally in my opinion back over 430 and possibly 460 eventually. 

I am bullish (short term) until a daily candle closes below 390. I am bearish once a daily candle closes below 390 and will remain that way till we see a change in sentiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/u7gmvrs0gjl91.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8ffb607841293f708f884465da63f85cffe75cf

Futures is showing a lot of the same sentiment. Bullish until 3900 breaks and bearish once that does break. 

Support is 3900 -&gt; 3827 -&gt; 3675

Resistance is 4000 -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4060

Apple had an interesting day today too. 

Along with SPY they both perfectly rejected their daily 8 emas. However, Apple attempted for the 2nd day in a row to break below and attempted to close below the daily 200ema, however, was once again unable to. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/37ou7833gjl91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7955134ddf94f32068b3de97d8fd5e52c66f5436

Apple is also another great candidate for level to level, however, unfortunately we ended in the middle of a level. We held 154.2 this week which is the daily 50ema. That should provide an upside push to retest resistance at 157.6 and eventually 161 which is this sell offs downward resistance line. 

Key support will be at 154.2 which would ensure a break down of apples 13 week bull support and would signal a bigger move down of Apple into the 140s.

I have the same purple trajectory line on Apple which shows a possible downside of 125 by October 31st is the same level of intensity and sell off was to occur of March to June. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mu3h6l3gjl91.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893a53038a33bb03c3168f2c7026fa0ea0ea8686

The VIX had a really interesting day actually. It started off the day with a massive sell off (when we were hella bullish) that led to a massive spike of the VIX to a peak of 26.3. However, the Vix managed to close its daily candle back under 25.5. 

I have 18.9 to 25.5 and 25.5 to 34.9 as a key level for the VIX. We spent a lot of time in that 25.5 to 34.9 level which is when we spent most of our time selling off. However, the fact that the VIX is not ready to hold over 25.5 and is not ready to see a higher move up to 30 despite a 13day and 10%+ sell off says a lot. This also gives me a bigger expectation of a move to the upside. 

My expectations would be a move Tuesday thru Thursday up to that 405.2 range and then Friday will start the next sell off. 

Remember markets need a reason to sell off. CPI will be the next catalyst for a sell off followed by FOMC.

10% challenge-

This was a frustrating week for me where I just beat myself. I started the week off with a big loss (my own fault for removing my stop loss and thinking a bigger sell off was coming‚Ä¶ of course came the next day). I fought back all week trying to get back to a green. I managed to recover a lot of my loss but still finished red. 

I miss played yesterday failing to take profits on two winning puts that the EOD massive rally burnt me on. Then I unfortunately got caught bag holding a call right before the markets bottom fell out. I was able to turn the day around today and finish nicely green though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yavjc654gjl91.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3cdb0bd366879f0f8c3206733b66e88a9cde6f1

The good from this week was my swings. This week I played some 5-7dte swings on apple and spy that all paid well. I went extremely small so despite how well they paid. I also did really good this week identifying level to level and setups. However, I failed to be aggressive enough to capitalize on the moves. I watched a lot of great setups and moves go 20-50% and failed to take them out of caution. 

The biggest failures this week was trusting the trend too much. Monday I expected the trend to continue and it did not. By time I went to cut my loss it was nothing left to cut. Similar happen today that I failed to accept the break down and was expecting a rally (in this market despite the wildness of some of these moves up or down once they happen we really should not expect an equal or bigger reversal). 

I did have two great wins yesterday I failed to take profits on which led to some green and resulted in the week finishing green. Even with my big loss Monday‚Ä¶ had I close my two trades profitable yesterday (when they were green) and today cut my loss any time before I did I actually would have turned in a great week. 

I also let the fact that I was down $xxx all week effect my trades as I was constantly looking for the ‚Äúbig move‚Äù to get me back to green all at once instead of just taking the good clean setups. 

The plan next week is some smaller position sizes with 20% take profits and 30% trailing stop loss on all plays. I am going to be more pro-active and more aggressive with my entries and exits. And when I recognize the move I envisioned didn‚Äôt happen I am going to aggressively exit early instead of letting it run to my stop loss. The full stop loss should only be utilized when I catch a bad move or some sort of fuckery like this mornings dump. 

Everyday is a new day and everyday is a day to learn and improve. Not the week I wanted but I take the good and the bad of every week to revise what I am doing to make the next week that much better. 

I hope you guys have a great weekend and enjoy the extra long weekend.

Analysts believe that the customer is a single entity. The scuttlebutt is that Apple is behind these deals, with the goal of using Globalstar to provide satellite connectivity to a future iPhone. Globalstar says it has been working with this customer since 2020 ‚Äúin connection with the assessment of a potential service utilizing certain of our assets and capacity.‚Äù

518,1662069154,x3jpof,1,"I had mentioned last night in my TA that the probability of closing a 4th red daily candle was low. There has only been about 4 times this year that has happened. However, I wouldn‚Äôt have imagined spy to make a $6.74 rally in 3 hours to end the day. 

There is a lot to unpack about what happened today and where we might go. 

https://preview.redd.it/kg7k4ie8jbl91.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c503a857b04719ee0158ba051cf76a1e7ee1ef47

My biggest mistake today was that while I saw 391 support broken (a key daily level) when that support broke i was expecting a continuation as we had great momentum and volume support to take us lower. Closing 15min candles below 391 should have, well could have, led to a bigger downside especially after a bearish jobs report and such a red pre market. However, what I missed was that the bulls actually defended 390 extremely well and they just took back control of SPY and the markets today. 

With that massive 390 support bounce and close over 395.2 support there is a case now to expect a retest of 405.2. As I had said before I want to play SPY level to level. With this bounce here next key level is 405.2 to the upside. 

What we need to watch tomorrow to see how the week is going to go is see where we close. IF the bulls defend 395.2 and especially 392.8 support tomorrow we will be poised for a bigger upside push. There is a chance we will see a small morning sell off to back test support and then we will push green and look to break 398.2 and eventually the bulls need to retake 400. 

The scenario I am seeing play out right now is a green close tomorrow over 398. This will give way to a 405.2 resistance test and I do believe we go up and touch resistance near 410 next week. I do think next week will be bullish and we run green. Then we have CPI on September 13th. I believe markets will begin to price in CPI on Monday September 12th (perhaps even Friday the 9th). From there we start our descent down back to 390 and eventually 380 before FOMC. 

However, if the bears can take control again tomorrow and we can CLOSE the daily candle under 391. Then there is a case that next week actually continues the drill. 

I would have liked a red close today for a more probable green day tomorrow. However, this green close today really complicates whether we saw support established and now we go back to 405.2 or whether this was the much needed rest before we see lower lows next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/nfw423r9jbl91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cc7c1f8d2102109a5c9be7886f0a69968378d0b

Futures candle is actually even more impressive with that massive dragonfly doji. This candle shows upside should be expected tomorrow. 

3960 was established as support tomorrow and that will remain the critical level followed by 3923.

Bulls will look to overtake 3986 and possibly 4023 tomorrow. Which would lead to a bullish push back towards 4100 next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/ps3o2ngajbl91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dad85cde860055b1bb1b61377db41bd39af4f47

Now apple is an interesting one. Today we saw the 12 week long bull channel support line broken. That means the recovery support from the June lows has been broken. This support has held for 12 weeks that‚Äôs a huge deal and is very bearish. However, you see that red channel held. 

https://preview.redd.it/2j8e8hwbjbl91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d3e736ab344cd394feee0235778e842fa7aaf9

Apple held itself up long enough to not break through or even touch 154.1 support. Apple also broke back over key weekly level of 157.4. Bulls will look to take apple back over 161 tomorrow if they can. If they are able to do that we may see a push back up. 

While apple broke the 12 week daily bull channel it has not broken the 12 week long weekly bull support. So apple remains in an upward trend until otherwise proven.

Tomorrow I hope will provide some key answers on Apple and will give us better direction along with SPY.

Overall I mostly expect a lower support test form apple near 157.5 and SPY near 395. If those levels are able to hold tomorrow I do favor an upside push tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/ehmfibmcjbl91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27ad8d0fd330633f94107301d2b02ebfde03de65

A bigger give away of what way we are going tomorrow will be the VIX. The VIX has tried for 4 days in a row to close over 26.8 and has failed to do so. We are seeing the vix closed back at key 25.5. A closing under 25.5 tomorrow going into the weekend would be a very bullish case for SPY and would further support a case for a bullish week before markets begin to price in CPI.

Today I tried something a little different. I wanted to test my macro ability so I started playing some smaller position sizes so that I wouldn‚Äôt mind letting them run or sit a little before I felt I needed to take profits. Overall it was going extremely well. The issue I ran into was greed and I majorily missed the 391 support being established today. I should have closed the first put around 20% green but i was letting it go as I was seeing after 391 broke and we closed candles below it a back test of 391 resistance before we pushed to 388.5. The morning was so bearish in nature I got caught being greedy. The other put I had two different chances for 5% profits and failed to take them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that also caught me up today was that VOLD was so incredibly bearish all day. From pretty much open till 1pm you can see we just straight dumped all day. However, that was obviously not the trend we saw. Even from 1130 to 1215 when we were pushing green the volumes never really pushed green with it. The extent and strength of this volume is like we saw last Friday with that huge red day. This was another reason I struggle to believe in the gap fill happening today and why I failed to close my puts when I should have. 

Today was a really good learning day for me. I closed slightly red today but I learned a lot from today. I look forward to tomorrow and chipping away at the weeks red.

521,1661998454,x2vjmj,1,"Is the option market badly under-estimating (and **under-pricing**) the likelihood that APPL announces a deal with GSAT on Sept7, the day the iPhone 14 is unveiled?  I think the facts say yes, largely because the Apple-focused market seems so ignorant of the story of Globalstar and its technology. A few details:

Last year,  based on nothing more than an (easily disprovable) rumor that APPL was planning to announce a GSAT deal as part of the iPhone 13 launch, GSAT shot from $1.43 to $2.69 in early Sept, then back down when the deal didn't happen.   A year later, the same story is beginning to repeat, only from everything I have dug up this time the technology is real and ready, there is lots of varied supporting evidence, and industry experts, including the top satellite analyst Tim Farrar, think the deal is real this year. 

So what will happen to GSAT if a deal is announced?  Well, if last year's poorly sourced rumor could send GSAT up to $2.69, it seems reasonable to say a real deal with the world's most valuable company should send GSAT much higher.  Let's assume, very conservatively,  it jumps to $3.50.  Right now 9/9 $2.50 calls are selling for 11 cents.   If the deal is real and you exercise on Sept 9 for $3.50, you'd turn 11 cents into $1,  9x your money.  Of course, the stock could go much higher than $3.50...

So what's the evidence this time the deal will happen?  A little history...  

Apple's has had what Bloomberg called ""a top secret team working on satellite"" since 2019.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/apple-has-top-secret-team-working-on-internet-satellites](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/apple-has-top-secret-team-working-on-internet-satellites)

On Feb 10, 2021, Globalstar issued a press release GLOBALSTAR‚ÄôS BAND N53 IN QUALCOMM‚ÄôS X65 MODEM""   ....""By having global 5G band support for n53 in Qualcomm Technologies‚Äô 5G solutions, our potential device ecosystem expands significantly to include the most popular smartphones, laptops, tablets, automated equipment and other IoT modules.""  GSAT Stock Jumped from  $1.28 to $2.48 before giving up all those gains. 

Skip ahead to Aug 30, 2021.  TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, speculates the iPhone 13 will use the Globalstar.  The stock goes from $1.43 to $2.69.  The only problem:  The iPhone 13 used the Qualcomm **X60** chip.  That was \*not\* the **X65** chip released 6 months earlier with the Globalstar band.  The x65 will be in the iPhone 14, Apple has confirmed.  That means the new iphone released next Wed. will have a built in ability to connect to GSAT.

There's a lot more to the story, especially the part about how APPL is almost surely the company that has anonymously invested \~$450 Million in GSAT already.  More on that:

There are a lot of bearish omens that are forming right now in this market. I think the next month is going to be very interesting. September is historically a down month for SPY and the markets. We will see how things develop. 

SPY also turned its 4th red day in a row and made its 4th lower low in a row. Can it go for 5?

https://preview.redd.it/ktk3d61604l91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9cd7a7324fade230bbbee8ab3193db631f4ab59

SPY daily closed below the previous daily support of 398.2 today. However, we failed again to reach the next support at 394.5 and also test blue bear support there too.

Key supports tomorrow are 394.3 -&gt; 393 and then 391. If we were to see the daily candle close below 391 tomorrow that would be a pretty strong indicator that we are about to see a bigger break down on SPY and could even be testing the 370-380 lows in the month of September.

Key resistance is going to be that 398.2 level tomorrow. If bulls are able to breakout over that level we will look for a bigger move back to 402.2. 

https://preview.redd.it/zfaf4kt604l91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28402b1e1f9677bead59646d76922541f97d0a32

SPY weekly still showing us in a nice downtrend with next major weekly support at 390. If bears break through to the 380s by EOW we are looking at a bigger sell off coming over the next month or so (leading into CPI/ FOMC). 

https://preview.redd.it/hjk91vh704l91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f33d46b08623d6380e1be99345538abeb887533

While SPY did not test its blue bear channel Futures did. It found support perfectly at 3953 there. That means tomorrow we should look for key support for futures at 3940. However if that breaks down we will be looking at support at 3920.

Resistance will be at 3988 and 4025.

https://preview.redd.it/tg5l12f804l91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8886d711e16fbfc6a6c62e6016320bbf0c684fb5

Apple actually was the most exciting EOD chart here. I had mentioned how 157.3 was key support‚Ä¶ upon further inspection it was closer to 157.1 if you zoom way in. Well today EOD spy dropped almost $0.8 in one second and bounced right off that 157.1

This was a confirmation of the 12 week bull channel support level (black lineS). However, in order to prevent a break down of this channel Bulls have to open apple over 158 and hold that line all day long. I do not suspect the bulls have that type of momentum.

We will look for support at 157.1 to break down tomorrow which will lead to a test of support down at 155.5 which is also that daily 200ema. A break through and closing back under the daily 200ema will be a very bearish indication going into September. 

Key resistance remains at 158.9 tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/bu91b65904l91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b80b52d64a78518984477898d74ccea0c1cf462

The most bearish thing that happen to apple today is breaking key 157.5 weekly level. While the weekly candle really does need to close below here to confirm it‚Ä¶ we should expect further break down to 154.2 weekly level. This is a weekly level that if broken breaks the 12 week long weekly support.

The most perplexing thing of the whole day is how SPY managed to drop $6.2 intraday and the VIX managed to close red. So either volatility is disconnected from the markets right now OR markets actually agreed in the selloff and that causes less volatility today‚Ä¶ both perplexing.

Tomorrow morning we have initial and continuing jobless claims. Usually not a big market mover in and of itself, however, when we look that the markets now have switched to a bearish sentiment‚Ä¶ if we were to see a decrease in jobless claims markets could see that as a bearish indicator that the feds policy isn‚Äôt working yet (they wont say it but they need unemployment closer to 5-6%). However, a big increase could mean the feds hikes and everything is working. Will be interesting to see how things play over night. 

We have also see two days in a row now green opens that have turned to a red day. Will be keeping an eye on futures tonight to see if they finally see a sell off overnight that holds at open or not.

Slowly crawling back to closer to breakeven on my week after a bigger loss. 

These candles have been hella volatile lately. I have considered whether should do some smaller plays and let them run for a trend level to level intraday (like I did the 0dte). I am also toying the idea of some smaller 3-5dte plays for level to level swings too. Things I will continue to evaluate as long as we are playing level to level.

Holding these puts overnight still. 390 will net me about 100% if we hit it tomorrow. I was planning to average down at 402.2 if we retested it today but we never made it. Had I averaged down I woulda closed up 25%... But I am going to look for a possible 398.2 retest of resistance tomorrow for a place to average down there. I still believe in 390 by EOW and will let this play out. However, a close over 398.2 tomorrow I would close these regardless of where I am at if that were to happen.",8-31-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis,1.0,2022-08-31 20:33:07

Let's do a bit of research and attempt to make sense based on our limited primate IQ.

&amp;#x200B;

# Circuit City &amp; Best Buy

I put these two together because they share the same sector, but one survives the other doesn't. Circuit City failed to turn around during 2008 recession completely, shutting down for good, while Best Buy is still operational today, just had their earnings report, and some apes here have been mistakingly thought we are all about about BBY. True regards.

One of the most damaging moves that Circuit City did was $1B stock buybacks. Source: [https://www.richmondfed.org/\~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ\_focus/2013/q3/pdf/economic\_history.pdf](https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2013/q3/pdf/economic_history.pdf)

Hey, guess what, [so did BBBY during Tritton's presidency](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-advances-1-billion-three-year-share) just last year! $1B dollar worth of stock buyback. Terrible idea. Stock has been spiraling downward ever since.

Even though Best Buy survived the 2008 crash, it faces yet another challenge: Amazon. What they did to turn things around is to focus on their [""showrooming"" and price-match challenge](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/amazon-almost-killed-best-buy-then-best-buy-did-something-completely-brilliant.html), and build partnership with product brands such as Apple. ""Showrooming"" is what big box retailers have an advantage over online retailers like Amazon. Bed Bath and Beyond better be showrooming lots of towels and scented candles.

# Sears

An infamous blunder down the capitalism drain. There isn't just one mistake to pinpoint when it comes to Sears, just a series of bad decisions one after another. Some notable errors: buying K-Mart when it was already struggling, failed to capitalize on the ""discounted goods"" market unlike Walmart, and failure to innovate. Very small e-commerce presence. Amazon took their customers like candies from a baby. Stores were not being maintained, and friction between upper management and employees are just icings on their bankruptcy cake.

To their credit, they did put some efforts, and did some right things, but more wrongs than rights.

&amp;#x200B;

# Six Flags

These guys managed to get out of the grip of bankruptcy because some hedgies and investment companies spent a whopping $725 million in debt restructuring and capital infusion, effectively reducing their debt from $2.7B to $1B. A whole lot of breathing room to invest that much capital on growth. This is somewhat similar to BBBY that JP Morgan decided to recapitalize with that $400M juice.

# Starbucks

Out of the 2008 economic meltdown, this one shines out and bright. You can order your pumpkin spice latte pretty soon, you millennial apes. What they did right was they closed down stores as they expanded too rapidly, shifted their focus back to customers, building relationship and brand awareness through social media and customer engagement.

What about BBBY?

1. BBBY will receive capital infusion from JP Morgan and RC Ventures (to be revealed tomorrow), just like Six Flags did. **This is good news.**
2. [There is a desire and need of restructuring and changes from the management](https://www.hometextilestoday.com/retailers/bed-bath-beyond-interim-ceo-we-are-working-with-urgency/). **This is also good news.** At least, they aren't sitting on their asses like Sears did.
3. Store closures. **This can be both good and bad.**
4. Bankruptcy is more likely out of the table. What Sue with reveal tomorrow will determine all your bets. Although at this point, I am just thinking the only way this company can go even lower is bankruptcy news. Since it's unlikely, it's just up from here on.

528,1661891914,x1tt0w,1,"Well nothing quite like an almost $8 sell off within an hour and 15 minutes of open to look like we have another Friday drill day on our hands only to end up chopping the rest of the day. 

In terms of trust‚Ä¶ there is no trust in this market. 

https://preview.redd.it/taocde18wwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9dc3013e8bf872087baa0486fded3b806a5852c

We are still attempting to find support for our blue bear channel. Today we could be establishing the actual support if we use August 10th and today as support. 

We did not retest 405.3 today which in bearish in the fact that we are separating ourselves from that resistance level on the daily. We also managed to break though that 402.2 support that was holding us up yesterday and also took out the next support at 398.9. However, due to the daily candle finish new support is going to be at 398.2 tomorrow now. 

Bears were not able to continue the sell off past 396. Key supports tomorrow is going to be 398.2 and then 394.4 (this is the blue channel support). If we can take those two levels out the last support is the daily support level at 391. 

My ultimate target remains 390 to 391 by Friday this week. 

Resistance wise the bulls have some work today and they need to retake 402.2 resistance tomorrow. If they can retake that level we might see 405.3 again. We are currently sitting right in the middle of the daily resistance and daily support levels we should continue the break down to 390/391 this week though. 

https://preview.redd.it/embk8tn8wwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4696fc9405d0110448611ff7c95b0068e65f4f7c

Spy weekly continues to show a breakdown pattern and we are closing into that blue support line for the symmetrical triangle. That support is at 387 for this week. However, weekly level support remains at 389.4 for the rest of the week. 

https://preview.redd.it/w1dlh0c9wwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b88bf03c489ef5862d0d828e31970d848525de3

Futures established support at 3965 today and never looked back. It also back tested resistance at the daily 50ema and failed to retake it. The futures daily candle is actually an engulfing candle too which should lead to more downside tomorrow and rest of the week. 

Key supports are 3988 followed by 3965 and then the blue support line at 3955. From there if we break through those we should test red support at 3940 and potentially breakdown as far as 3925.

Key resistance remains at 4025 and 4060.

https://preview.redd.it/wfwghtw9wwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48500aed56d0dead59bbd5ed3132bee58087977c

The weekly is continuing to look bearish. We are seeing the weekly 8ema and weekly 100ema as resistance. Support remains at 3900 and 3875 for the blue symmetrical triangle support line. 

https://preview.redd.it/mm87ssjawwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424a9dbf91b2b849ad77ba293958db48e8646d44

Apple continues to have nice breakdowns however it is not seeing the magnitude of moves that it used to see on big red days. It continues to lag behind it appears that most tech is in a slow bleed rather than a massive sell off that will bottom and bounce fast. 

Apple did bounce off key support of 158 today and failed to go lower. 

https://preview.redd.it/f1hjc82bwwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1e04c4f0d09282b47f239d97cfe80286d13c8b7

I went ahead and closed both my Apple longs here. They were down more than 50% at open so I couldn‚Äôt really hold them much longer. I was able to offload them at 157.5 before the big EOD bounce so I take that as a nice win today.

Support tomorrow will be at the blue bear support and black bull support (this is the 12 week long bull channel that apple has STILL not broken) at 157.3 tomorrow. If we see a bounce here tomorrow that is a pretty bullish indication that markets might not breakdown much more then here. 

However, if we break through 157.3 I will be looking for the gap fill to complete from July 28th at 157.64 (apple missed it by about 8 cents today) and will look for support next at  155.5. 

Resistance will remain at that 159.9 and 162.2 levels for tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/v7bpplnbwwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a01223fc6e082647122c8c05680f9145214b14c1

I mentioned playing level to level on Apple weekly and that‚Äôs what I was doing with my puts I played from that 161 level down to the 157.5 bounce today. Apple did hold support there and that is also the weekly 20ema. We are holding under the weekly 8ema currently and will need to see that support of 157.5 broken by EOW to ensure further downside. 

As you can see the 12 week long weekly bull channel support remains at 154.3 for this week. 

https://preview.redd.it/yv5t99ccwwk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0963583c6b0b1da8c7e911a9183d6beb9d6fc233

The VIX did attempt to breakout today, however, was unsuccessful in breaking yesterdays high. It did retest that 25.5 level and held that level support once again. We will look to see if VIX can close back over 26.7 tomorrow. Markets should remain bearish as long as VIX is over 25.5. 

10% challenge-

https://preview.redd.it/2kecixvcwwk91.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05d3807f83ec783ee0e876b5136ca7492ba94541

Was able to recover some of yesterdays losses and hope to continue recovering more as the week goes on. I have accepted that I will most likely close red this week. So I am working on damage control one win at a time. 

https://preview.redd.it/cvc1lrcdwwk91.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c56738d33450498443ba835a8f80a79e004a4703

I did open a 3dte 394p closer to EOD (regrettably for the massive pump EOD) but I am holding this put until we see 390. IF we can touch 390 tomorrow or Thursday this should be a nice 100% play for me. 

I haven‚Äôt been much of a fan of swings lately as I have found I have trouble seeing them through and I cant really manage the loss how I would want to. So what I have done if I swing now is I open the position to be the size that if I was to take a 100% loss it would be only a 10-20% loss on a normal position. 

I do expect we COULD open green and back test resistance at 402.2 tomorrow. If we do I will be okay with averaging down one time there. However, besides that I do not plan to touch this.

529,1661856113,x1fq6d,1,"Apple may announce its long-rumored satellite connectivity feature for the iPhone 14 next month, according to Tim Farrar, a satellite communications consultant at California-based research firm Telecom, Media and Finance Associates.

In a [series of tweets](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1562967341347901440), Farrar said [T-Mobile's and SpaceX's satellite connectivity announcement](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/25/tmobile-spacex-satellite-connectivity-iphone/) yesterday was likely intended to pre-empt Apple's announcement of its own satellite connectivity feature for the iPhone in partnership with Globalstar. Apple is holding a media event at Steve Jobs Theater [on September 7](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/24/apple-announces-september-7-iphone-14-event/), and the event's ""Far Out"" tagline and starry sky artwork have fueled speculation about a satellite connectivity announcement.

In February, Globalstar [announced](https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-signs-contract-mda-new-satellites) that it acquired 17 new satellites to provide ""continuous satellite services"" to a ""potential customer,"" which might be Apple.

Farrar said Apple's service will be offered free of charge for two-way text messaging only at launch and will use existing satellite spectrum, with no rule changes from the FCC required. By comparison, T-Mobile and SpaceX plan to leverage T-Mobile's mid-band 5G spectrum and support SMS text messages, MMS, and select messaging apps, but Farrar believes this more ambitious approach will face regulatory hurdles around the world.

*Bloomberg*'s Mark Gurman first reported that Apple was [working on satellite connectivity](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/20/apple-secret-team-satellites-beam-data-to-devices/) for iPhones in December 2019. Earlier this year, Gurman said Apple was still working on the feature and said it [could be ready for the iPhone 14](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/25/iphone-14-to-miss-out-on-48mp-camera-and-a16/) later this year. Gurman claimed the feature would be intended for use in emergency situations, allowing iPhone users to report emergencies to authorities and send short text messages to emergency contacts, and he added that the functionality could also be available on a new Apple Watch.

iPhones [would need a special modem chip](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-emergency-satellite-features-iphones/) to connect to satellites, according to Gurman, suggesting the feature might be compatible with the iPhone 14 and newer only. By comparison, T-Mobile said the ""vast majority of smartphones"" already on its network would be able to connect to SpaceX's satellites with their existing cellular chips.

Additional details about Apple's rumored satellite connectivity feature, such as whether the feature will be limited to the U.S. or available globally, remain unknown. Apple's media event begins on September 7 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

533,1661805259,x0z3h2,1,"Well if you know me you know my two least favorite types of days to trade are either days we open with a massive gap up or down and trend days‚Ä¶ today we got both. 

Lets break down the fuckery that was today. 

https://preview.redd.it/owyue00kqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f3928be4c5de0b6dcac736a05e88761dbabd1b

Overnight we saw futures drop to -1% and higher for most of the night, however, by morning they had given back a lot of that overnight drop. Leaving a nice gap at 405.22 to be filled. From 930am till about 1030am the bulls tried as hard as they could to gap fill and failed everytime. This sent us into a pretty convincing sell off. However, the bulls had other plans in mind and from 11am till really the last candle of the day the bulls were in control. The most impressive thing was despite all the times that SPY looked weak and ready to break down with perfect setups and even volume dumping the bulls managed to rip the candles back bullish. I actually am impressive after Friday massively red day and the massive red futures and red gap down we had that the bulls were able to take control the way they did today. 

Once we gap filled 405.2 continued to be support. It was not until the last candle of the day that we finally saw the actual weakness of the day set it with a nice nearly $2 sell off on the last 15minute candle. 

https://preview.redd.it/br7bpuokqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9abc28ec28fcc0db77502675210b1ce4e47d48aa

We are trading below key resistance levels of 405.2 now. With that resistance we should expect to revisit 390 now. As I mentioned we should expect to be able to play level to level on spy and apple. 

Key support for tomorrow is going to remain at 402.1. with the blue bull support being at 399.9. 

There is also a projected red bull channel to keep an eye on with support at 402.1 tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough this is giving me Monday/ Tuesday flashbacks from last week. We had a big red day followed by a gravestone doji with slightly lower lows made. 

Overall looking at the red bull channel we have possible upside of 424.4 this week and the blue bear channel gives potential downside of 395.4 this week. Of course this blue channels support is only projected so the actual downward channel support could be much lower then where we are currently. 

https://preview.redd.it/772e7wdlqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae8a627f397dac89f4f3a56e433127052977f66

One interesting thing on the weekly that is forming is this solid black falling wedge. This falling wedge could actually result in a breakout to the upside. For this to play out we would have to hold the 401.2 low of day all week though. If we break that 401.2 level then that falling wedge will get negated. 

Key weekly resistance remains at 408.4 and major support down at 390.

https://preview.redd.it/5jspzqzlqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196f441749f25ecec2479b9fa02bb934021ed342

Futures daily looking the same as SPY with Key support of 4023 over night and tomorrow. From there the blue bear channel support is at 3995 with the red bull channel support at 4032.

Upside potential for the red bull channel is 4332 and blue bull channel potential downside is 3956.

https://preview.redd.it/08vi1njmqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e97cc83d51c1cba9007bb7ae1b4417294750a8b

Futures weekly shows the same possible falling wedge with key support being the lod of 4006 to hold the rest of the week. 

Key resistance for the weekly is 4112 and key support is 3902.

https://preview.redd.it/y0s3gg5nqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca1cca36dddec3caef8713f23c0dd134553b378c

Apple didn‚Äôt really have as dramatic of a day as SPY and they actually didn‚Äôt even gap fill completely today. And despite how many times SPY had retest hod apple never actually retested its HOD. 

Key support will remain at 159.8 tomorrow and if that breaks we should look for support at 158.2 and eventually gap fill at 157.64.

Blue bear channel support is at 159.2 for tomorrow with the red (this is the 12 week long bull channel) being at 156.8.

There is actually besides the 12 week bull support line not a smaller bull channel like spy/ es futures has. Therefore upside potential for Apple is 166.8 for blue bull channel resistance and support of 156.8 for downside potential based on the daily trends. 

If we see that 12 week bull support broken that would be a bigger omen for SPY and the markets in general. If we see big tech call that will be extremely bearish for the future. 

https://preview.redd.it/odcyw4snqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59854a27bdb0ef1599eb3e1a86b528edd7134224

Apple weekly does show that same falling wedge that SPY/ ES weeklies are showing. Key support will be at the 159.8 low for that. A key support to break through is the weekly level of 161.1 from there bears will look for support at 157.5. If 161.1 support holds bulls will look for 163.7 and 166.5.

https://preview.redd.it/4cfxlmcoqpk91.png?width=358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb08147da117d9fcb91b63e7f25cc13df48b9168

I am actually long on some this Friday and next Friday DTE apple (were ATM) puts. There are a little red right now but with the trend continuing to show weakness by Friday I do plan for these to be fairly green. My target sell for the 4dte is 157.5 and for the 11dte is 154.3.

https://preview.redd.it/mkiom2uoqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc7e08e997756eef31c295b59553772f5ffa2612

The VIX had an interesting day today. We had a really massive gap up that was followed by the gap filling and support at 25.5 being retested. That support held perfectly and resulted in a really big bounce up for VIX EOD and a close over 26. We are not trending back in the 25.5 to 34.7 channel that we have spent the majority of 2022 in. this is another bearish omen for the markets. As long as VIX is over 25.5 I do suspect we see downside. We lose 25.5 that will be a reason for the markets to turn around. 

So on Friday I mentioned while I wanted to be bearish I was skeptical. Like I had mentioned the markets need a reason to sell. And today they didn‚Äôt have a reason to sell. Almost all day we saw ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù playing out. It was clear who was in control today. However, EOD there we did see the bears take control with that $2 sell off. With the gap being filled and a rejection of key 405.2 level there could be a reason for the markets to sell off and there could be a reason markets do not want to hold anymore. The media is shifting to a really bearish narrative we haven‚Äôt seen since really February or march. This is going to be an interesting week and as long as SPY is below 405.2 resistance I favor a test of 390 support.

Straight up bad day for me. Made a great trade in the morning. Got a bad bounce on a fake break down for the -13.2% loss. 

I trusted that a range day was building with 404 becoming resistance. I entered a put on that 1230 candle that massively broke down and regrettably broke my rules and entered with a SL. I saw how choppy markets were and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wanna get stopped out before I would get rewarded‚Äù because I was convinced we would see a massive sell off and close under 402.2 support. 

Well I was wrong obviously as they gap filled us and then every convincing sell off candle was just ripped back green and when we finally did sell off as I was expecting it was too late. Bad day and bad way to start the week off. No one to blame but myself. 

Important thing for me here is to not over trade and to not break any more of my rules‚Ä¶ when you take a tough loss you have to fight back organically. Don‚Äôt over trade and definitely don‚Äôt revenge trade trying to get back.

While everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple‚Äôs valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.

A lot of people treat Apple like it‚Äôs the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:

&gt;P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  
&gt;  
&gt;P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  
&gt;  
&gt;P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  
&gt;  
&gt;P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  
&gt;  
&gt;D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  
&gt;  
&gt;Long term debt: $93B  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Earnings: $59.4B

Currently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:

&gt;P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  
&gt;  
&gt;TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)

In their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.

Apple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.

The reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. 

Apple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple‚Äôs revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple‚Äôs revenue and earnings will drop even more.

Everyone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn‚Äôt as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it‚Äôs expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can‚Äôt see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I‚Äôm wrong.

Another product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they‚Äôve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they‚Äôre gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [‚Äúmocked‚Äù](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.

Apple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it‚Äôs hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That‚Äôs a pretty big risk for a company that‚Äôs been bleeding cash.

And finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple‚Äôs main advantages with their software is the fact that they don‚Äôt show ads. When this changes, Apple‚Äôs software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple‚Äôs ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it‚Äôs hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he‚Äôs full of bad takes.

As Apple‚Äôs earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. 

If they don‚Äôt halt or decrease their buyback, they‚Äôll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.

tl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it.

So let's say your stock doesn't have voting rights or you don't care about them.

So let's assume that there are around 3,000,000 million births in the USA in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/birth-rate-increase.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/birth-rate-increase.html). If just 10% of the 3M shop only using BuyBuyBaby 3.0M\*(0.1) = 300,000 babies or customers. 

I am using the lowest price, 7 days because babies shit, spill, lose things and piss everywhere and rounding down. Each family purchases one stroller ($120), one car seat ($100), a crib ($130), pacifier ($1 each x 7 days = $7), toys ($1-5 x 7 days = $7-35), bedding ($10-20 x 7 days = $70-140), clothing ($5-10 x 7 days = $35-70), diapers ($50 for 100 pieces x 3 = $150), bath tub ($30), towel ($5 x 7 days = $35), baby monitor ($40), baby bottles ($20), baby food/formula ($10 x 200 days = $2000) and other shit. 

120+100+130+7+35+140+70+150+30+35+40+20+2000= $2877 for one baby.

Today we closed out at almost 102 mil volume which is about 160% of the 30day average. This is a massive volume day and is the highest volume since June 30th which was 112mil. Usually we consider large volume days to be bearish days. So this type of volume really could be signaling something much bigger is coming downside wise. 

https://preview.redd.it/aw9j9l3vl4k91.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90f229817d1a67bd2c881d86c78b7831dba2798b

Okay so where are we at? 

As of this morning I was working under the assumption of us trading within that blue downward channel, however, as you can see we broke through that end of day today. 

The big things that happen is we broke back through the daily 8, 200, 20, 100 and 50ema‚Ä¶ so we now have closed below all of those levels. Being back below all the EMAs hasn‚Äôt happened since the lows of July. 

We broke through key level support of 417.5 and from there we bounced and closed right on the next level support of 405.2. I mentioned we should start playing level to level. So breaking 417.5 we should have expected 405.2 (of course not in the same day‚Ä¶ ) but if and when we break and close below 405.2 I will look for 391 as our next major support for a bounce. However, if we double bottom at 405.2 we could start back toward 417.5.

The daily candle is a massive bearish engulfing candle that not only engulfed the previous days candle but the whole week and 62% of this whole months trading range.

We did not completely fill the 421.22 gap this morning as we only reached 419.96 before we saw the major downturn at 10am. The next gap below is down to 378.57.

So something interesting that I mentioned earlier this week is that‚Ä¶

If we are assuming August 16th and 431.73 is the ultimate top of the bear market rally we should look for 374.3 and September 16th as the next possible bottom. However we could see a range anywhere from 388.5 to 362.6. 

https://preview.redd.it/o29oqibwl4k91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0375e1d20d2c0aa7246d10bb19fbb24a0fccb47

Fun fact‚Ä¶ Cpi is on September 13th too and the next FOMC meeting is September 20th. There is a potential that we could see the next big bear market sell off and it could lead us right into CPI/ FOMC or those could be what takes us to the bottom.

Interestingly enough on SPY weekly we did not break through the 11 week long bull channel. We actually bounce just short of support which woulda been right at the weekly 100ema of 404.2. However, unless SPY plans to open over 409.91 (1.1% green) and never lose that support all week we will see that level broken on Monday. That would be the confirmation we need to suspect the next level down. 

Major supports to watch next week-

405.2 (daily level) -&gt; 404.2 (weekly 100ema) -&gt; 390 (weekly and daily support level) 

Major resistance to watch next week-

407.5 (daily 50ema) -&gt; 412.7 (weekly resistance level) -&gt; 417.5 (daily resistance level)

My overall thoughts are if we close below 405 on Monday that its safe to assume we see 390 before 417.5 again. If we hold 405 then we might try and retake 417.5 first. The most likely scenario for Monday is an ‚Äúinside day‚Äù where we trade within the previous days range and then Tuesday make a big move.

Futures daily is the same story we broken through all the levels and closed back below all the EMAs for first time since the lows of July. 

Key support- 4020 -&gt; 3922 -&gt; 3865

Key resistance- 4075 -&gt; 4100 -&gt; 4130 -&gt; 4157

Futures weekly actually did hit the 11 week long bull support line and did as of right now break the weekly 100ema of 4050. Again unless futures opens big green Monday and hold 4092 all day long and week long we will be through support which should signify a confirmed downward move towards 3906.

Key weekly support- 3906

Key weekly resistance- 4112

https://preview.redd.it/cj9bdv9zl4k91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=943e85f54a32d328d7bb51b199bea09b3d2bc9ee

A lot going on here with Apple so they closed with about 79mil volume which is the largest volume day since August 17th (the peak). Apple also had the reddest close since June 16th (the bottom). 

I was watching a potential black bull channel within the bigger red bull channel but we fell through that support. I was also watching a blue bear channel that we also fell through that support. 

So lets clean up this chart. 

https://preview.redd.it/mgxi83xzl4k91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f402fb3dcb39f51a1be46f7601ea7d27382e43a

As of right now the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù bull channel resistance using the June 8th and August 17th high with the Low of June 16th and June 30th for support we have a potential down side for Friday at 158 for Apple. 

Apple also closed back below its Daily 8 and 20ema. Apple almost filled its upped gap leaving about 25 cents there (that could be considered filled tho) and it also filled its lower gap today. The next gap on apple is at 157.64 and should be a potential target for next week. 

If we start to breakout upward we will look to that blue resistance line now established for rejection. 

Key daily support- 163.2 -&gt; 160.8 -&gt; 158.1 -&gt; 155.5

Key daily resistance- 164.9 -&gt; 167.5 -&gt; 168.7

https://preview.redd.it/9xgej7o0m4k91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fe08854cf31bf1ee1e3a52f9e145067225e04cc

The apple weekly actually gives a pretty good breakdown of where things are headed. 

The weekly gap is almost filled and would be okay to go unfilled the rest of the way. From here we should test the red bull channel support at 154 next week. Once we would lose 154 it should a clear down side to 120s/ 130s. 

Key weekly support- 161 -&gt; 157.5 -&gt; 154.1

Key weekly resistance- 166.5 -&gt; 172.2 -&gt; 176.2

I actually really like Apple for a level to level play also here using these weekly levels. So once 161 breaks look for 157.4. 

https://preview.redd.it/j6vluda1m4k91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b498a54e2ca44011a7dbf44361e4ade187439b8a

The VIX is the true winner today with a crazy 17.26% day. The VIX broke through all the major resistance levels and closed back in the 25.5 to 34.7 zone. If this can hold this level on Monday I would look for VIX to take us to 34.7 and eventually take SPY back to 360s/370s. 

However, if VIX were to lose 25.5 on Monday or any day next week then we will look for it to end up back in the green zone form 18.7 to 25.5.

So you guys are probably asking whats the play? What would I do? Am I long or short on anything? 

Well honestly I wouldn‚Äôt open or hold anything after a massive -3.4% day like this. You have to think about it like this‚Ä¶ I know many of you were in 30 and 60dte puts and I know many of those were up 200-500% depending on when you opened it. 

Would you rather close out a 200% gainer and open a new position (of the same size) for pretty much free (since your win paid for it) or would you rather hold till Monday and take the chance the markets slap the bear and we get a 3% green day and erase everything that happened today? You HAVE to secure profits. You can not let profits like that slip away. 

We are meeting the criteria that makes me think we are going to see the next major sell off. The one thing that will continue to hold me up is ‚Äúwhat is the catalyst for the sell off to continue?‚Äù Markets have known all of this info for months now and now all of a sudden they wanna act shocked? Is this just a massive over reaction and now we rally till CPI actually gives us a selling point followed by FOMC or is this actually the start of the next sell off? 

I am not someone who enjoys swings because I feel like my timing is never quite there (yes I know I can predict things pretty well but seems like whenever I take a long swing im early or way late‚Ä¶). The better play here is to wait for bottom and then play the rise back up with calls. Market will naturally and way more aggressively rise. Markets need a reason to sell off though. 

But the play I would consider is VIX &gt;$25, SPY &lt; $405 and Apple &lt; $163 on Monday at market close and we should expect to see VIX 30, SPY $390 and Apple $155-158 within the next week or two.

This week for me felt like one of those weeks where you just beat yourself. I had two trades this week that I let go red. I also had two trades that TOS screwed me on (one was a 15% stop limit that didn‚Äôt fill and the other was a 8% winner then filled at -1%). Thats four winners I should have had this week (not excuses but that‚Äôs how I look at it). Had I gotten those 4 winners (2 definitely my fault) I would have ended up with 88% win rate and at least $1000 this week. I beat myself this week is how I see it. 

But next week is a new week and Monday is a new day to do better. 

This market is chewing up and spitting people out left and right. This market is all about capital preservation. We have to think long term. 2022 is probably the hardest market any of us will trade in and probably the hardest day trading we will do for the rest of our careers. If you can survive 2022 profitable or not‚Ä¶ but just don‚Äôt capitulate out‚Ä¶ you will someday be hella prosperous. This is a marathon not a sprint!

A lot going on here now on the daily and we finally got some direction! 

SPY this morning tested the daily 8ema and daily 200ema, however, were smacked down to almost the lows of days. The bulls managed to regather all their strength and popped it not only through key level of 417.5 but they also popped it straight through and closed a candle over the daily 8ema and daily 200ema. 

This is a heavily favored bull chart right now. I had mentioned I took an L on my 418c (Friday dte) calls yesterday and it now appears I was about one day too early on those calls. This movement is what I was actually anticipating to happen yesterday. 

Now that we have closed over the daily 8ema, 200 ema and over key 417.5 resistance we should favor upside here. I mentioned last week (and got a lot of flak for it) that I did not go long put 30-60dte puts yet because I had a thesis where we would retest near 430 before we saw the sell off. Well that thesis looks to becoming true right now. 

With this fairly bullish close we should look for the 421.22 gap fill tomorrow and IF ole daddy JPOW can whisper the right sweet nothings to the markets we just might even see 430 tomorrow‚Ä¶ 

Key support- 

417.5 is the line in the sand. If we tomorrow lose 417.5 and close under it then it is time to go short and this should be seen as a failed breakout attempt. From 416.7 breaks the recovery support line. 

Key resistance-

418.8 (blue downward channel) -&gt; 420 -&gt; 422 (gap fill at 421.22) -&gt; 424.8 -&gt; 426 -&gt; 427.9 -&gt; 429.4 (bear market resistance line‚Ä¶ 2.3% day)

Futures support-

4183 -&gt; 4175 (breaks recovery support) -&gt; 4156

Futures resistance-

4210 -&gt; 4223 (downward resistance) -&gt; 4232 -&gt; 4256

Being that Apple broke through its resistance line of the downward channel (the same ones spy and futures are just below) I suspect we see a green day tomorrow across the board and we should see Apple fill its upper gap. 

Support-

170 (recovery support line) -&gt; 168.8 -&gt; 167.5 -&gt; 166.4

Resistance-

171.6 (gap fill at 171.31) -&gt; 173 -&gt; 174.6

The VIX broke its recovery support line today and therefore we should look for a bullish day for markets tomorrow while it completes its gap fill at 21.27 and potentially retests 19.7 support area. 

Where are we at then? What should we expect tomorrow? 

Well tomorrow morning we have PCE releasing which will be interesting as that is something that JPOW specifically mentioned was important and even more important then CPI. 

From there at 10am JPOW starts to talk about at the Jackson Hole. This is pretty much what my expectations are for tomorrow. 

If we look at the past times JPOW has spoken whether it be random meetings like this, any time he has testified, and even FOMC meetings/ minutes. What is the one common theme? Markets rally like no other. There has been times where JPOW is testifying for two days and the markets go on a bull binger for two days straight and then the third day once he is finally done speaking markets dump. 

This is my intentions and this is my thoughts on whats going to happen tomorrow and how I would like to play tomorrow. 

I am sitting cash gang overnight. I will check market sentiment in the morning and as long as we aren‚Äôt in some massive red open and massive sell off before 10am then I will most likely look to enter some calls to let ride for the day. Overall if this is going to do what I suspect it is going to do then we should see low volume over all (due to no sellers) and from there we should see SPY ride the 5ema/ 8ema on the 15min chart and not break it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how we know we are in a big trend day up. From there the key timeframe bulls have to survive with the trend through is 11am. 

I will try to if the trend holds ride calls all day long and then I will save some BP and I will look to open some 30 dte puts. My expectations are that we do retest bear market resistance and that we do see a retest of 425-430. The only reason I would NOT open 30 dte puts tomorrow is if 1. I run outta BP making trades (profits over speculation always) or 2. SPY breaks and closes over 430. 

10% challenge-

Its just been one of those weeks for me. Thankfully working with a green day and green week despite some rookie mistakes and TOS not filling two of my wins earlier this week. Patience remains key in this market and fast profits. Despite some of these huge moves we are having we are still having high volatility and trends that break the technicals.

This is a picture of the last 2 trading days on SPY (15 minute chart). What do you see? 

Well you see that 415.5 is key resistance to break through and 411.8 is key support to break through.

What does that translate to on the daily? 

Bear case- If we can break through 412 (daily support) and then close a candle below 411.8 (15min candle) I will be looking to SPY test 407.5 and ultimately level support at 405.2. 

Bull case- If we can break through 415.3 (daily resistance) and then break through 415.5 and close over it with a 15minute candle I will be looking for a retest of 417.5 (daily resistance level). From there we look for the 421.22 gap fill and ultimately a retest of 430.

Key levels 429.8 -&gt; 417.3 -&gt; 405.4 -&gt; 391.2 -&gt; 366.8

Futures is just as simple too. 

Break through 4158 resistance and im looking for 4210 retest. We fall through 4130 and 4110 and I will be looking for 4073 retest.

Apple is just as simple too. 

We break through 167.5 resistance and I am looking for 169.8 followed by the gap fill at 171.5. If we were to lose support at 166.5 I will be looking for the gap fill at 165.82 followed by support at 163.3.

The VIX started its gap fill process today. I suspect we could see it filled tomorrow. The VIX will look to gap fill 21.27 which would mean a bullish day for SPY. However, if we see VIX break out over 24.3 and especially break into the 25s then there is a good chance the sell off is coming.

Tomorrow and Friday are huge data and fed days. Tomorrow we have the revision of the GDP which is expected to be revised slightly better, however, will still confirm we are in a recession if its negative. IF that happens to be revised positive‚Ä¶ well you better buy some 0dte SPX calls and let them run all day.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know what this is that‚Äôs what it is‚Ä¶ 

There is two ways to look at this Jackson Hole‚Ä¶ either JPOW is going to say all is well I have no new data and I will wait for September CPI before we make a rate hike decision (aka dovish) or hes going to say I have been telling you guys the same thing for months and no one listened. Inflation is not under control and a 100bps hike is most likely and we will definitely not be pivoting this or next year. 

I think a lot of this chop right here is related to that and the markets not sure what JPOW is going to do or say.

Just been one of those up and down weeks for me. Missed three great plays by about 5 seconds (had ordered qued ready to enter and then it ripped before i could hit buy). Took a call about 5 minutes too early (it dumped on me and proceeded to face rip the next candle) and then I closed my swing call I opened. I opened that swing yesterday when I suspected the gap fill was coming. However, once we got absolutely smacked down twice trying to bullishly breakout I decided to cut the loss. Overall still on a path for a green week despite a odd week overall (had two positions that should have closed green but were closed red due to TOS not filling me and giving me a terrible fill). 

Two days to go this week and so far thanks to proper risk management im in fine shape so far.

I haven‚Äôt really see a day where the majority of price action was all within a tight range like that in a very long time. That was a frustratingly boring day to watch. 

https://preview.redd.it/zvgm4h5zwij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40af3217d6375453a83994854a4390a2b4939970

On the daily you can see we closed out today as a gravestone doji which I have touched on this many times before. A gravestone doji at the top (as in when price is running up) is usually a bearish reversal, however, when we are seeing a gravestone doji at the bottom of a trend (when price is dropping) then that usually is the signal of the bottom. Look at SPY 8-17, 8-9, 8-2 and Apple 8-9, 8-2, 7-26, and 6-17 for examples of what I mean. 

The most bearish thing that occurred today in my opinion is that we attempted to break through the daily 20ema at 414.9 and pretty much hit a brickwall. Once we hit that price and rejected we never saw it even attempted again. The only small bullish caveat here is that we did wick over the daily 20ema which could be seen as a hint of whats to come. 

Today price magnet all day was around 413 so of course that will be where we need to watch the most tomorrow. 

With the gap fill at 421.22 now 2.15% away from close it is harder to imagine that bulls fill that gap tomorrow, however, 2% days are not out of the norm and with the VIX closing just over 24 if that were to unwind back down to 20-21 that would be a big push for SPY green. 

Key resistance tomorrow-

415.2 (black resistance line) -&gt; 417.5 (daily resistance level and 200ema at 418) -&gt; 420.1

Key support tomorrow-

411.3 -&gt; 409.4 -&gt; 407.6 (support area for the July 29th to present bull run) 

Something to keep in mind that historically the SPY gaps do usually fill within 2 days‚Ä¶ of course this doesn‚Äôt always happen but it does have a history of doing so‚Ä¶ 

Overall I am still expecting that over the next two days we are going to push green and see that gap fill on the daily and weekly. Once that gap is filled I believe we will see Friday turn into a fairly red day as we are going to get JPOW talking at the Jackson Hole which he is going to once again say all the same hawkish things he has said for the last 2 months‚Ä¶ expect this time markets are actually listening‚Ä¶

Futures is what I will keep my biggest eye on as we go forward tonight and tomorrow. 

We saw a nice hold of that key 4120 level. As long as bulls can defend 4120 I do see a case to retest that 4130 level. However, if we do lose (close daily below) 4120 then we most likely are going to be looking for 4000 here by next week. 

Key support-

4120 -&gt; 4100 -&gt; 4075 -&gt; 4040 (projected new red bull channel) 

Key resistance-

4120 (black resistance line) -&gt; 4158 -&gt; 4184 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4210

Overall the black resistance line that has been showing this current 3 day down cycle is at 4120 tomorrow. In order for that line to hold and therefore trend we have to see ES close below 4120, open below 4120 and never break 4120 tonight or tomorrow. I do not personally for see that happening. 

https://preview.redd.it/d3vfsjh0xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60c69a4b3cd172ff910fe5fa0f14916ba2aceb0

There really isn‚Äôt much to see on SPY weekly but on the futures weekly you can see we also bounced off of the weekly 8/ 20ema which is trending right at 4118. Overall if we were to see a close below that then that would be a very strong indication of downside to come. If those two EMAs hold as support that‚Äôs strong bullish case. 

https://preview.redd.it/uhr71421xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10eda127ba8e591cffca8b513ac440d51c7278cc

Under SPY I spoke about how a gravestone doji is usually a bullish reversal when we are in a down trend. I highlighted on Apple everytime we had a gravestone doji on Apple daily and you can see almost all of them were followed by a fairly green day. 

To be honest this Apple daily candle closed in no mans land. We are trading within that 166.4 to 167.5 area where due to the gaps and wicks there really hasn‚Äôt been much price action at all to gauge sentiment. 

We are nearing the first gap at 165.82 with only 0.9% to go until that gap would be filled tomorrow if we break down.

Overall mostly on Apple I am going to keep a close eye on 166.4. If we were to break down through that support then I would think that the upside for SPY and Apple is more limited this week and that we might either consolidate down here or just drill. 

https://preview.redd.it/x7anznu1xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79fd01b87493626b07d47a1224af96300c89e51c

Apple weekly shows that that 166.4 level is a very key support that we should keep and eye on too. 

Apple and Spy weekly still do have gaps on their charts. 

https://preview.redd.it/rwlhjv83xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655a6ce205702bf3df406029fdbaff631b852ac8

The VIX is very interesting here to say the least. So after trading so long down at that 20 level we have now spent two days trading up here around 24. 

We do have the GAP on the VIX which I did mention in my video we have not had one since the June sell off and whenever we do have a VIX gap we don‚Äôt usually see it left for more then 2 or 3 days. 

VIX also is still rejecting breaking out of this 24.2 level. This is where we continue to keep our eyes on tomorrow. If we break out over 24.2 tomorrow and see 25 then the sell off is likely to come. If we see VIX settle down and we see it start pushing down to 22-23 like it tried to intraday today the gap fill is coming. 

This is one of those times where the VIX actually would be helpful to watch. 

10% challenge-

Despite the pretty much terrible chart we had on SPY to trade today I had a good day. 

https://preview.redd.it/lhvx7ov3xij91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47419fbdc82a8d1f954db7610988dc9b5a78798f

I took 2 calls for a 10% profit. 

I am not sure about you guys but TOS has been really screwing me over lately when it comes to fills and orders‚Ä¶ So yesterday you guys know my limit sell skipped over and now today. I opened that put at 9.5 and price hit 10.2 (so I was up 8%) I set a 2% trailing stop limit (purposefully set it at 2% to limit slip) well it triggered of course at 10 premium‚Ä¶ however, TOS didn‚Äôt fill me till 9.4. Of course im pissed off and contact them why I have nearly $1 of slippage on a contract like that when I was green and all they could tell me was that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how market orders work‚Ä¶ perhaps you should try a limit order never time.‚Äù   
   
 

To be honest I have been pretty much over TOS/ TDA crap lately and its only getting worse. They truly don‚Äôt care about their customers anymore‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs a discussion for another time. 

Overall a good day despite the fill issue. Looking forward to a possibly better trend or at least wider range day to get some better trades tomorrow too. 

See you guys tomorrow! Youtube will be up later.",8-23-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis,1.0,2022-08-23 20:33:38

As of last close, shares in the firm had fallen 60% since the latest so-called meme-stock rally peaked last Wednesday. The plunge followed the disclosure by the company‚Äôs top investor Ryan Cohen that he was selling his stake, while a report that suppliers were restricting or halting shipments after the firm fell behind on payments contributed to the declines.

Cohen went on to offload all his shares in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, triggering a record 45% intraday tumble for the stock on Aug. 19 as he pocketed $68.1 million in profits. Retail investors have since been scaling back their purchases of shares in the firm, according to data from Vanda Research.

Fellow meme-stock darlings AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. were also trading higher in premarket trading.

569,1661223951,wvdhs5,1,"Hello regards, I have been looking at some short squeeze plays for the last while and found this beauty of a gem.

AVYA has fallen 96.14% over the past year due to decreasing revenues and increasing chances of bankruptcy. Former CEO Jim Chirico has been ousted as a result, and in comes Alan Masarek who was the CEO of Vonage Holdings.

Looking at Masarek's tenure at Vonage, he joined as CEO in November 2014, the share price of Vonage was $3.51. He voluntarily stepped down in July 2020, when the share price was around $10, so we know Masarek is capable of helping a company perform well. He also was the co-founder of Quickoffice, which was **acquired** by Google in June 2012. Judging by this, he has experience with companies being acquired, which is great for one of the points later in the post.

&amp;#x200B;

[Around a 200&amp;#37; increase in Vonage Holding's value when Masarek was CEO.](https://preview.redd.it/ecq4cwwsodj91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddad82c7506313aa627c79204d150735024374e9)

&amp;#x200B;

Enough about the CEO, let's talk about the current situation Avaya faces. Q3/22 preliminary results were announced and showed a 20% YoY decrease in revenue which was substantially less than what was projected. Original guidance was $685M - $700M in revenue, but it is projected to be $575M - $580M. EBIDTA was also lower than expected; from $140M - $150M to $50M - $55M.

They also issued a statement regarding their ability to continue as a company. Convertible notes due 2023, along with their surprising revenue drop, puts Avaya in a bad place in regards to their heavy debt load.

""So how can they turn the company back around?""  you might be asking.  Avaya OneCloud, a service Avaya offers, is growing at 21% QoQ and 118% YoY according to their last earnings report (Q2/22). OneCloud generated $750M in Annual Recurring Revenue as of Q2 and will probably see even more growth once Q3 earnings are released. This is the primary driver of growth in the company. The company anticipated that it would hit $1B ARR by the end of 2022. They also announced that they would start to cut costs aggressively in order to put themselves on the path to profitability.

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""The Company has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/fw94ojbvodj91.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=285c7e28e94998aeaa2c74f67646c3cb2126c770)

Avaya have also not submitted their 10-Q report (for Q3/22) on time due to an internal investigation, prompting the NYSE to issue a delisting notice.

These problems have caused the stock to drop 70% in a matter of days.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there is hope. Avaya stock has been shorted very heavily over the past while. Currently, according to Fintel, their short interest as a % to float is 20.32% (as of August 22). 20% SI% is considered really high. Off-Exchange Short Volume Ratio is also very high at 49.57%. This is volume that is traded off public exchanges in dark pools. Regardless of public or private trading, short interest is really high. AVYA is a great short squeeze candidate **if** people start to buy shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[20.32&amp;#37; Short Interest as a &amp;#37; of Float and Off-Exchange Short Volume Ratio of 49.57&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/9ua2inf3pdj91.png?width=1230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db6659d9423cf32e693f4a95715ac622e33da9b0)

&amp;#x200B;

Another caveat to consider is the value of the company. The current market cap as of August 22, 2022 is $70M. That's **extremely** low, especially for a company that does $3B in revenue. Even one quarter of EBITDA is almost as much as Avaya's entire market cap. This tells me that the company is severely undervalued and is primed for a correction to the upside. Another thing that could help is the low stock price. At $0.80, it is appealing to any investor and could lead to many people buying shares.

&amp;#x200B;

[Up 31&amp;#37; since business update about substantial doubt to continue.](https://preview.redd.it/uhcn25wbpdj91.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13097ac5092005b6c38c87d5709482085fd25752)

The price has gone up 31% since dropping on August 9th due to its terrible preliminary financial results and claim that the company has substantial doubt to continue operating. If the stock continues to go up, this could cause shorts to cover, propelling the price further up.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0b8ntrcfpdj91.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d4210cf75bf567a8680393389c254465c33126

As we can see here, AVYA is down 95% since IPO and 97% from ATH. This gives us a lot of room to go up in the event of a short squeeze. Also we must remember that Avaya is a big player in the communications space, so this isn't another shitty penny stock company. This is a company that has a long history, a reputable brand, and many customers.

&amp;#x200B;

On that last point, one last thing is that Avaya could be a great buyout candidate due to its vast customer base. According to them, they server over 100k customers in 190 countries. Some big customers they serve include **American Express**, **Apple**, **Barclays**, **Bank of America**, **Citigroup**, **CVS**, **GE**, **General Motors**, **MetLife**, **UPS**, and **Walmart**. Seeing this customer base should make a lot of companies think about buying them out, especially since they are at an attractive valuation.

&amp;#x200B;

[Avaya has a huge customer base located all around the world.](https://preview.redd.it/u589muegpdj91.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54751a62ff9e2aee85fc09c0d3dd76ea7f24baa9)

&amp;#x200B;

The future is promising for Avaya, especially since they have a new, reputable CEO that is capable of turning this ship around. Best case is that Avaya returns to double digits in share price and in return, provide value to us shareholders. Another great case is that Avaya gets bought out by a company looking to expand their reach in terms of customer base. Worst case scenario, the company goes bankrupt, but even then it wouldn't necessarily be over for the company.

One more thing, we can track retail activity by using Google Trends. In the past 12 months, search results for NYSE: AVYA are at their highs.

&amp;#x200B;

[Rapidly increasing search volume for AVYA.](https://preview.redd.it/jw9fgwdipdj91.png?width=1423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a5b161f1105bb273cee6f537cae17039f921ba)

It's great to see that more and more people are searching up the stock. It indicates that the stock is gaining momentum in regards to interest in it.

&amp;#x200B;

There is my analysis of $AVYA. Usually, since I'm a lazy regard, I let other people do my DD for me. But since Avaya is still under the radar, I decided to do and publish my DD for this company and stock purely based on its current situation which had me really intrigued. This is my first analysis of any company, so I hope you enjoyed it!

Zoom Video Communications Inc. is struggling to convince people to pay for its videoconferencing service in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a trimmed forecast and falling stock price Monday.

Zoom ZM, -2.07% executives reduced their earnings and revenue guidance for the fiscal year Monday afternoon, and Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg blamed a stronger U.S. dollar ‚Äî a problem many global tech companies have called out in recent earnings reports ‚Äî but also a decline in ‚Äúthe online business,‚Äù or the more casual Zoom user.

‚ÄúOur revenue was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, performance of the online business, and to a lesser extent sales weighted to the back end of the quarter,‚Äù Steckelberg said in a statement included with the results.

In an interview with MarketWatch and a conference call Monday afternoon, Steckelberg acknowledged that individuals and small businesses have changed their habits. Many aren‚Äôt flocking to the service as often or for as long as they did during the peak of the pandemic, when many Americans were working almost exclusively from home and socializing with friends over the service. An increase in one-on-one meetups, vacations and hybrid work schedules have altered the post-pandemic business cycle for Zoom, executives acknowledge, and getting users to pay is harder.

‚ÄúThe big challenge is new customer additions,‚Äù she said.

Zoom recently installed a 40-minute limit on users with a Basic, or free, subscription, which Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said could be a way to push more users to become paying subscribers. Steckelberg told MarketWatch that the time cap has had a ‚Äúsignificantly positive impact‚Äù so far, but admitted in the conference call it was ‚Äúnot enough to overcome the macro dynamics.‚Äù

The news wasn‚Äôt all bad ‚Äî Zoom‚Äôs enterprise business, which sells subscriptions to larger organizations, grew 27% to $599 million. Enterprise customers improved 18% to 204,100 over the past year through contracts with UCLA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -7.43% and others, as well as longer deals. Zoom Phone licenses hit a record of nearly 4 million, up more than 100% year-over-year.

‚ÄúIt was a mixed quarter, with enterprise proving to be strong,‚Äù Steckelberg told MarketWatch.

The ongoing friction between employees who wish to continue to work from home and employers like Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.30%, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs GOOGL, -2.53% GOOG, -2.58% Google and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META, -2.92% ‚Äî all of whom are sitting on acres of unused commercial real estate and asking workers to come in at least twice a week ‚Äî could have a profound impact on Zoom. A group of Apple employees on Monday launched a petition asking CEO Tim Cook for a more flexible work policy.

The company also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.94%, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -2.03%, Google and many other corners.

M Science‚Äôs software analyst Charles Rogers believes users aren‚Äôt jumping to other platforms, but cutting the service because of inflation and more relaxed pandemic guidelines. He also saw more worrisome results internationally than in the U.S., with a second consecutive quarterly decline in the European region and sequentially flat sales in the Asia Pacific quadrant.

Zoom posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $45.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, up from $1.02 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Zoom reported earnings of $1.05 a share, down from $1.36 a share last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 94 cents a share on revenue of $1.12 billion.

Zoom executives said they now expect full-year adjusted earnings of $3.66 to $3.69 a share on revenue of roughly $4.39 billion, down from $3.70 to $3.77 a share on sales of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion. For the third quarter, they expect 82 to 83 cents a share on revenue of about $1.1 billion, while analysts on average had been projecting 92 cents a share on sales of $1.15 billion, according to FactSet.

Zoom shares declined nearly 9% in after-hours trading following release of the results, after closing with a 2.1% decline at $97.44. Zoom‚Äôs stock is down 47% so far in 2022. The broader S&amp;P 500 index  SPX, -2.14%  has slid 13% this year.","Zoom is struggling to convince consumers to pay, and the stock is sliding",1.0,2022-08-23 01:48:45

* QQQ closed down 2.63%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 1.91%
* VIX closed up 15.64%

Good evening everyone, hope you all had an excellent and productive Monday. The stock market continue its pullback that started last week when the indices ran into their May highs. This is still ‚Äútechnically‚Äù a market rally but the recent selling has definitely put pressure on this rally. This selloff may be in anticipation of Fed Chief Jerome Powell‚Äôs speech which he will give Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This speech will give investors a better idea of what the Feds economic outlook and may contain clues about future rate hikes. We may see lots of sideways action, especially after todays selloff, until Jerome Powell speaks.

SPY gapped down and fell throughout the day without making really any attempt to recover in price. We broke back below Mays previous highs which served a resistance area in early August. With this break and a close below the 21 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/), investors should be cautious about opening large long positions. This combined with the increase in volume we saw today means we need to be careful with new or open positions. Hopefully we will see some consolidation around these levels and a push early next week to new highs.

QQQ has a more positive outlook but not by much, the highs from June remain intact as a support zone but we did see a close well below the 21 day EMA. We had slightly less selling volume today but have still not seen any days recently with strong buying volume. QQQ is definitely acting stronger than SPY at the moment but both indices are telling us to be cautious.

**Recap on recent positions:**

I am currently sitting completely in cash. My lost position was in Apple (AAPL) but I was forced out Friday at my buy price.

**Potential Setups:**

If you read the [ETF and Market Evaluation for 08/21/2022](https://everydaytrades.com/etf-and-market-evaluation-for-08-21-2022/) posted yesterday you will notice many stocks that are doing okay in this environment are in familiar sectors.

Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) had a huge day today moving up 5.85% on a large volume increase. It stopped just short of its most recent high and has a potential buy point of $31.90. If this triggers and you choose to buy be careful if the market is not acting well. The major indices can play a large role in how an individual stock moves.

https://preview.redd.it/pzcm17eomcj91.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e04b2aaea9ad8c221ae9176cdfdc6ecb0ddb5e67

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has a small base with a buy of $306.00. This base is somewhat far from where VRTX closed so if we see this trigger it will need to be associated with heavy volume and a good market.

There are very few other stocks setting up with high probability trades. Todays decline hurt many stocks regardless of sector. It is interesting however that the sectors showing strength now, primary oil and energy, are the same sectors that where acting strong back in January and February.

**Bringing everything together:**

Following todays sharp selloff and Jerome Powell speaking on Friday there are few stocks setting up with nice bases. Buying a stock on a pullback hoping for a bounce off of the 8 day or 21 day EMA is extremely risky at this point. This continues to be a news driven environment and risky positions can quickly turn against you. There are a few sectors that are showing strength but many stocks within them have been damaged by todays selloff.

I bought 100 shares of AMC in premarket for $11 and snagged 20 of the first APE shares at $6.95. Was very happy at first, with a combined gain of about $200. Thought blissfully ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold these forever.‚Äù

Goodmorning traders, it's no secret I was expecting a gap down going into Monday. However, I am expecting the gap down to max us out to the down side so get ready for a pop up after the open. This pop could be pretty violent, so I will be repeating the game plan I had on Thursday. Once we hit recent lows on market strength, I will roll a part of my position out and down to lock in some profits and reenter either around 421 or 425 on the spy. Will do this on shorts I have in apple and the qqq‚Äôs as well. Now welcome back to volatility for a spell. Volatility is going to mean some violent two-sided action before confirming a new trend direction. Whatever high we make over the next two days divide the range into thirds and don‚Äôt get ran over by playing in the middle third. The key part of human psyche to beware of is that because of what we have been thru retail traders didn‚Äôt take long to give up their stance on a bull market and buying the dips so going down could be twice as fast this time. Also, go back and read the numbers to Europe's CPI print. The US massages the calculation but Places like Germany and UK don‚Äôt, Germany‚Äôs last print was 118 vs previous of 117 and UK was 123 vs 122 last print. If you didn‚Äôt catch the wave Friday, don‚Äôt panic and try to get short at the open, stay calm and wait for the reprieve to happen. 

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)422-423, (queen)424-425 and (king)426-431 area. Support (jack)421-420(queen)419-418 and (King)417-414. The main thesis is Bearish bias closing below 422.14 projected target/low of between 419-414. Alt thesis is Bullish bias closing above 422.14 projected target/high of between 423-428. The current major channel we are in is 425-416.¬†I am repeating the game plan for from Thursday and one of the reasons I am doing it is to build a bigger position down to the down side without risking much.  Scenarios for the day: 

1) Trend day down we open gap down and start with a rally back toward the previous close. We find resistance on or before the previous close then begin the downtrend for the morning. We find midday chop around either possible queen or king support.¬†It could feel like a trend day up with how big the gap is but until we get a reasonable close above the previous close it is still a trend down day. **38% probability** 

2)¬† ¬† Expanded Range Day structure We could look to set a decision area/ low boundary around the jack or queen support area before rallying back up and chopping sideways briefly before reversing to lows again. ¬†¬† Or vice versa **32% probability** 

3) Rounded reversal day type structure. We could get a continued push higher toward jack or queen resistance area and find midday chop around either queen or king resistance before spending the same energy we used going up to come back down the second half of the day or vice versa.¬† **30% probability**",Volatility is back or should I say back into the volatility box we go. 8/22/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY.,1.0,2022-08-22 11:33:06

&amp;#x200B;

When a stock has reached its maximum FUD is when you should be buying, not after the hype has been spread, and all the groupies jump on the ship.....

&amp;#x200B;

What we have seen is maximum FUD with many of the stocks, but one in particular, that being Blackberry. Evern on Reddit, they will not allow any upvoting to support what seems to me as a hostile take over actions of Blackberry, by who I am going to guess is Musk, as how can we know the true short position without a decentralized blockchain? As the endless selling and the manipulation from the insiders prove nothing here adds up.

When the run up came last year, why did the CEo jump out of the closet and scream - ""I have no idea why the share price has gone up""? And did he not dump a large amount of shares during this time (this I can not testify to though I am sure someone can verify this)? The next question why is he still hiding the facebook settlement? It has been 6 quarters and he is no longer collecting revenue which he was prior to the settlement, of say $50 million a quarter, and you can find anything on the quarterly reports, yet, he does wonderful in decimating the EPS. Another question, with all the partnerships and the IVY self driving software [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy) why has no revenue been declared for the 200 million vehicles it currently is installed in? And dont forget the 500 million on the backlog for installation, as we can all be aware these vehicles wont be driving themselves for free...

&amp;#x200B;

Then we review the patents the hold for cryptagraphy - [https://blackberry.certicom.com/en](https://blackberry.certicom.com/en) and the utility of blockchain security, as we can review any crypt project such IOTA with an $800 Million plus Market Cap, with no sustainable revenue or path forward, such is the greater fool theory. [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/)

&amp;#x200B;

Then of course comes the Cylance Security [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/cylance-endpoint-security) which has proven profitable, and now with former *McAfee* president John Giamatteo as president of its cyber security business unit, what amount of revenue will this generate... 

Now taking into account the partnerships throughout, for example, Microsoft, Amazon, (Meta as I am sure they are hiding the NDA as currently Meta is testing Blackberry End to End point Cryptagraphy for the messenger app throughout - WhatsApp, Instagram and FB - and their will be a large dollar figure paid to Blackberry quarterly on completion of the testing and implementation), and these are just a few players in the game..... 

Now reviewing the next item, how many EV manufactures has BB captured through out the global stage, with their self driving software? From my limited understanding I have been told all of them, excluding one, that being Tesla. And what did Tesla just do? Did they just not shutdown their auto pilot department? [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-of-autopilot-workers-in-latest-staff-cut) now why would they do such a thing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now then we come to the next item of concern, the Apple Killer, the Tesla PI Phone, now is this reliable or not?? Who am I to guess, though it makes sense,  [https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/](https://smart-phoneprice.com/new-tesla-phone-2022/) \- and where does this lead us, well Blackberry sure did create a great deal of despair when the legacy patent deal did not come through, though if you believe that deal was ever anymore than a jab to blind the investors, so they would give into more FUD, as the inside players are feasting on the insider knowledge, and the retail players are just being decimated, as i am sure if you do a bit of research it becomes clear very quickly the moral characters you are dealing with when you review the board members (one in particular who disgraces Warren buffet by referring to himself as the CDN one). 

And of course this post will get slaughtered by the reddit bots, who are against anyone doing anything other than holding bags, but for some reason, I would like to speak out and tell those who are having hard times to take a look at this, as the calls are cheap the SP is in the gutter, though all the fundamentals are in place, and it is evident management has been burning the books to ensure profitability is not seen, though what do I know I am just some guy who wishes he lived in his mom basement, though I am not that blessed...

Lets take a look at where we are. SPY- 422.14 (hit), Apple 171.52 (hit) and VIX 20.59 (hit). So all three conditions to make me consider the top was in hit today‚Ä¶ however I did not go long on puts yet today and here is why. 

https://preview.redd.it/jmw5knf4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d251511037330a044881177d14b0b2b3f9dcd498

If you are to put todays (on the left above) and yesterdays (on the right above) 15min intraday trading charts right next to eachother what do you see? You see consolidation. Today we opened pretty deep red and had a nice 30 minute sell off but after that the bulls were just as much in the game as the bears were. This was not some sort of capitulation, top is in, send this to the 360s tomorrow day. This felt almost like a ‚Äúslip‚Äù by the bulls. I did not see the crazy sell pressures and the crazy straight down trend day all day like I was looking for despite hitting all my price targets. The thing that happened was we had a big red pre market that helped us get to those price targets. The actually intraday trading today was essentially just another range day. 

I want to have the weekend for the markets and everyone else to maul over whether the next leg down is beginning or not. There are still a few more things I would like to see first. 

https://preview.redd.it/3n150my4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a510737b95b36b7b1cb0c3ceb9b49b51dc806da

On SPY daily chart you can see that we finally broke the 9 week long bull support. And this wasn‚Äôt just a small retracement through it like back on August 9th this was a clear break through it. 

Bear case- We saw the red 9 week long support line broke, the daily 8ema was broken and closed beneath, we failed to resttest the bear market resistance after hitting it, we had 104% of the 30day average volume today (this means that there was a lot of activity as in sellers greatly outweighed buyers‚Ä¶ not just that no one was buying). This is the reddest close SPY has had since June 28th which did lead to a small sell off. 

Bull case- Despite breaking support we still managed to hold 422 as support. SPY has now spent 6 trading days between the 422 and 430 levels. This could be just consolidation with the final rest before we push to the next level up. Despite opening red and immediately selling off the bulls did not let this turn into a massively red day and also prevented the VIX from escalating too much. Despite today being the reddest close for SPY since June 28th which did lead to a 3 day sell off that actually then led to the current rally we are in. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rfi2ukm5jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca338b125c35906ea821d1677b77b0b1636a7723

The SPY weekly finished about how I expected with that nice gravestone doji. The candle body also closed below the previous weeks candle. I do believe looking at the weekly candle that we are at the top. However, one thing to note about the December and March tops is that despite similar candles the Friday close and Monday opening price were +0.3% in December and +0.2% in March. So that means we have most likely will open green Monday and we shouldn‚Äôt really expect a -2% gap down Monday (this is also why I was okay waiting to open a position). 

The weekly is still holding its 9 week long bull support‚Ä¶ the daily breaking its bull support though should mean that Monday we break through our support. 

I will be looking for Monday to open below the 428.4 support level. There is very little chance we gap up $6 Monday and hold that all week. 

Key major supports for SPY next week-

417.5 (daily 200ema and level support) -&gt; 414.5 (daily 20 ema) -&gt; 412.75 (gap fill)  -&gt; 410 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 405.4 (daily level support and daily 50ema) 

Key major resistance for SPY next week-

424.6 (black downward line) -&gt; 429.7 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431 (weekly bear market resistance line) 

Overall when you look at Spy its clear to me that the top is in. There is a slight case to be made that this is consolidation and that we chop here for a week before our next leg down. However, look at the way the market has ‚Äúturned‚Äù and overall sentiment has turned in the market I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a flat to red day Monday followed by the leg down. Monday I will most likely go into my puts EOD as long as its not a massively big green day. 

If we happen to get a big green day Monday or come out hella bullish then I would wait until we retest 429.7/ 431 to see if they retest and break through bear market resistance or not. There is a case to be made still for 460 before the next CPI in September.

Futures daily also broke is red 9 week long bull support finally and still has not touched actual bear market resistance yet. 

Key supports-

4188 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4120 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 4073 (daily 50ema) 

Key resistance-

4278 -&gt; 4310 (bear market resistance) 

https://preview.redd.it/iccj3i27jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d33e0ddec6055c47e030d05ed8633a623c83170

Futures weekly closed out almost identical to spy. We are seeing closer to a true double top here though. Overall I will be looking to see the weekly bear market support of 4275 broken Sunday night at open and from there we should see the start of the sell off. Like SPY though there is always a chance we could see a final green push that touches the actual weekly bear market resistance at 4325 (which would also make a perfect double top) before we see the leg down. Being that SPY touched resistance and ES did not I do have that thought in the back of my head. 

https://preview.redd.it/uz7j8qn7jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe10607d46561a53a39efd4ef006eddd185d92fa

Apple is honestly the main reason I did not go long on puts yet. I see we hit my price target of 172.3 which is great and all but I really wanted to see a bigger sell off. On Apple it bounced off the daily 8ema and did not close below it. This is the reddest day for Apple though since July 18th. 

A few things that have me hestitating that the actual top is in is that on Apple we broke the 3 week long black bull support line but we have still not even touched the 9 week long red bull support since July 26th. I would like to see this tested and broken officially. This also was not that red of a day in terms of Apple compared to the green days we have seen Apple having. This really seemed more like a rest day then a true drill day. 

Key levels to watch on apple

Support-

169.9 (red bull support on Monday) -&gt; 167.6 -&gt; 164.9 (gap fill) 

Resistance- 

173 -&gt; 174.5 (bear market resistance)

If I can see Apple on Monday especially break through that red bull support I would consider some 14-30dte puts to ride down to the 164.9 gap fill. I think that would be a very high probability play. There is another gap down at 157.5 but we could see the gap fill, consolidation and then either move back up or down. So I would hesitate a longer dte here and wouldn‚Äôt hold it pass the gap fill. 

https://preview.redd.it/wovgxoe8jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5eaaa694d543bf591ad242d815504251062e798

Alright so the VIX final is doing something right? Well yes and no. So we finally broke this massive falling wedge. So that means bottom of VIX is in and we are going to rocket to 40 right? Well no not really honestly. Despite that we still closed within this 19.5 to 20.5 range. It was a good start for sure. But I like I have said many times before would really like to see VIX close to 22 and put more than one green day in to really sell it. 

10% challenge-

As you guys who follow me or are in the server I really struggled the last month. My main struggle came from failure to mitigate my losses. I would feel so confident in my plays that I would marry them and by time I finally realized how toxic the relationship was for me‚Ä¶ they would take everything I have. I finally last week said enough is enough and I have started doing a 20% trailing stop order that is opened with any play I open. I mitigated my losses very well this week. And I was able to lock in a green week this week. It was not some amazingly green week where you put it on your fridge‚Ä¶ but it was a really good step forward for me. 

https://preview.redd.it/29zog4y8jri91.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6d85e441c10cd3b5d3a7ae84f7b01a88ad9ac7

Overall I locked in a green week. Again nothing to get too excited about. While its not an excuse but due to a crummy last few weeks I did use about ¬Ω my normal position size Monday through Wednesday which did mean when Thursday came and I finally felt ‚Äúconfident‚Äù and took two losses and a loss today that I erased a lot of gains. However, again still a good week. 

It‚Äôs a good step forward in being mechanical in taking profits and locking in gains. 

I did have a few issues this week with LIMIT orders that I missed probs 5-7 solid plays this week because I could not get filled on a limit order and by time I was ready to be filled the play had moved 10-20% already and then I was chasing. I am going to evaluate going back to market orders for opening like I used to. I did have one case also of a limit sell not being filled but overall my sells have been fine besides one play that missed. 

I look forward to this being one big step back in the right direction. 

I hope you guys have a great weekend and I will see you guys on Monday !

Wednesday, I said' ‚ÄúI am starting to come around to the thought once this happens, we can start to see a near term top or the beginning of a pullback that will take 3 days to completely get started. Wednesday will be the reversal start into Thursday and Friday will be another steam roller bull rally, with a huge gap down on Monday.‚Äù Tuesday; I talked about how to avoid getting chopped up by the algo trading programs. So now if you were falling me, you were short coming into today. I am expecting close to a 3 deviation move today or spilling over into Monday.  I Expect internals to open pretty low, I won‚Äôt know exactly where until we open but I expect to roll some profits out by rolling out and down in¬†some of my positions pretty early only to reposition myself back in hopefully above 426-426 depending on how market strength looks. I have shorts on in Apple, the QQQ and the Spy. I plan on rolling a portion of all of them so I can take some profit and keep some skin in the game. 

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)425-426, (queen)427-428 and (king)429-435 area. Support (jack)423-422(queen)421-420 and (King)419-414. The main thesis is Bullish bias closing above 427.89 projected target/high of between 427-433. Alt thesis is Bearish bias closing below 427.89 projected target/low of between 424-418. The current major channel we are in is 425-453. When we open, the channel we will be in will be 425- 416. Early this week I talked about a splash back down into the previous channel... Splash. ¬† Scenarios for the day: 

1) Trend day down we open gap down and start with a rally back toward the previous close. We find resistance on or before the previous close then begin the downtrend for the morning. We find midday chop around either possible queen or king support.¬†It could feel like a trend day up with how big the gap is but until we get a reasonable close above the previous close. **40% probability** 

2) Rounded reversal day type structure. We could get a continued push lower toward jack or queen Support area and find midday chop around either queen or king support before spending the same energy we used going down to come back up the second half of the day or vice versa.¬† **31% probability** 

3)¬† ¬† Expanded Range Day structure We could look to set a decision area/ low boundary around the jack or queen resistance area before chopping back and forth then pushing the low boundary again. Then give us a big rally up to close the day.¬†¬† Or vice versa **38% probability**",Recap and the Game plan for the next 3 days. 8/19/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY.,1.0,2022-08-19 12:19:18

**My prediction 3rd Friday,16th September 2022.** 

Biggest reason is because its my birthday on the 16th September and there was a typhoon in my city the same day when i was born.

Okay here we go, as i write the SPY is sitting at 424 pre market, Apple is at 172 (wtf just 10$ away from all time high), MEMES i.e. Retail favourites are going down rapidly with a Lack of trust generating and increasing with their promoters, I don't want to get into the details as its a touchy subject for many. But all i can say is in meme stocks, retail thinks they move the money and price, whereas in reality its just an illusion created by institutions and well marketed by their respected promoters. 

Please check institutional holdings of any meme stock big or small. You are not fighting against the hedge funds. 

""**Big actors move the markets and retailers are just participants""** Period. 

**Coming back to why markets will be heading south henceforth starting Today :** 

(1) Approx **$2 trillion** worth of options are set to expire on the 19th, 3rd Friday for the month of August.

(2) 3rd Friday for the month of **September i.e. 16th** is a Quad witching/Tripple witching day (whatever you may call it). Which means a ton of options expire that day. Example, during Triple Witching in September 2021 around **$3.4 trillion** worth of equity options expired.

We put in about one of the smallest overall movement days at $3.11 ive seen in a long time (was less than $3 till power hour) and we had yet another low volume day currently sitting below 50mil total on the day. 

Usually low volume would be bullish because that just means there are buyers and means there are no sellers, however, today its tough to really say that the low volume was bullish as most of the day there was not upward momentum. Today felt like a good ole stale mate. The question is‚Ä¶ who is going to win?

Looking at the daily you can see that we had a pretty good bounce this morning directly off the red bull rising wedge support line. I had suspect a bounce there would be a great call opportunity and it sure was. Tomorrow SPY bulls will once again be forced to defend that support line. 

You can see what has happened the last few times we have bounced off this support line, however, I will say this time feels and looks much different. 

SPY actually closed out its third doji in a row today. Gravestone doji to gravestone doji to dragonfly doji. 

So the question is where do we go from here? 

So tomorrow is monthly OPEX which always brings added volatility to SPY due to profit taking and rolling of options. 

https://preview.redd.it/oik15xhnhji91.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e20fc3b9fc5e577144d7431a3c58d3f8ea66d43

Here are the STATS for tomorrow. As you can see there is a fuck ton of OI on puts for tomorrow‚Ä¶ dang near 3x that of calls. And almost every single one of those puts are worthless as a poopy flavored lollipop. So what does that mean for SPY? I think we are going to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. While we don‚Äôt usually touch actual MAX pain and there would be very little argument to suspect we will have a $16 drop haha. 

But I am suspect for us to break through this red 9 week long bull support tomorrow. Which is going to set us up perfectly for the ‚Äútop‚Äù being in. My plan for the last week or two has been to wait till tomorrow night to open some 30dte ATM puts and I am very close. However, If we do not break that red support line I will NOT be opening puts. 

Key support-

428 (red bull channel support) -&gt; 425.8

Key resistance-

As I have mentioned I am watching this weekly candle closely to see how it finishes out tomorrow. If we close with a hammer and/or doji candle then I am 100% in puts. However, if they poke this candle tomorrow through that weekly resistance like of 423.5/ 4338 then I am going to hold off on puts. There is a VERY real scenario where we COULD see 460 by the September FOMC at the end of the month. I am still not counting that scenario out and as much as I would love nothing more then to be in some juicy puts right now‚Ä¶ I cant and wont be early like burry‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/om65d04qhji91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ba8070bda0e1fcec3bb7df87b5ee0fcf0b2896

I would dare say that Apple is looking weak cause its not‚Ä¶ however, I would dare say its slowed its abnormally fast ascent to ATH. Apple is currently about $6 from ATH and exactly 4.8% from ATH at market close today. 

Which is pretty crazy considering SPY is still about 14% from ATH but that‚Äôs to be expected when Apples been the golden child. 

Key thing I watched happen again today is that Apple attempted to break through and close over 175.5, however, they did not do it. They failed once again and failed to close the candle body over that line. That is showing weakness. With a doji on the daily today I am expecting some sort of retracement tomorrow out of Apple. 

Key support to watch is 173.3. If we break that we are breaking the 3 week long support line if we fall through that level. That would only leave the 9 week long (10 week by time they get to it) support closer to 170 for Monday. 

Key resistance remains at 175.5 tomorrow. 

So as I mentioned I REALLY am close to thinking the top is in and that we are going to see the top within he next week. My ideal case tomorrow to be able to open puts EOD (this will be after 4pm market close) is‚Ä¶. 1. SPY closing the daily candle under 424.7. 2. Apple closes its candle under 173.3 and closer to 172.1 if not below and finally 3. The VIX must break through its almost 3 month long resistance line at 20.5 tomorrow. 

If I see all three of these key things tomorrow then I will feel comfortable entering puts ATM 30dte. However, IF any of the three are not met then I will wait and re-evaluate Monday. 

10% challenge-

As much as I hate to upset the apes‚Ä¶. I did a bad thing today‚Ä¶ I played a put on the beloved. She was small and less than fulfilling but she did reward me a neato 50% profits.

I am not quite sure what it is about Thursdays but they continue to be my kryptonite. The one positive thing about today was that unlike the past I did mitigate my losses. I didn‚Äôt let a loser (even though both of those plays I had strong confidence in them) turn into bigger losers. I was mechanical and for me that was a big win. 

The first put I loss on was a great play but I entered too early and my stop got hit before I could allow it to play out. The call I got stopped out on I am not quite sure what happened but it was up about 5% and I tried 3 different times and it even hit 3 different times at the 5% premium target but it wouldn‚Äôt fill and then it ripped against me. Overall it has been a good week for me. I am still green on the week and I look forward to tomorrow trading and closing out the week green.

Now that it is legal to buy and sell otc hearing aids, I think this stock will be bought out. 

My second proposition on why ear will go higher and is because it has come down from a high of 76.75 and a 52 week high of 24.95. This stock has made me quite a bit of money ever since I bought at .83 and it is now at 2.60.

Perfect play for FOMC minute today I called out for you guys. I saw a lot of people take these trades and kill it today. Proud of each and every person who made killer gains today. 

I had a great day two green trades.. no complaints. However, I continue to mental block myself on these big fed days and big moves. In my mind I know that xyz is going to happen cause of historical and I pretty much call it out to the penny sometimes (called the initial 428.5 rejection at 2pm) but I continue to be in a mental block in this market. I had a while where I was going for too many homeruns and I was anticipating too much from this market and got burnt‚Ä¶ I got to a happy place taking my 10% scalps and now im very hesitant going for some of these homerun plays. The more im right the more I trust the analysis. I look forward to actual FOMC in September as that‚Äôs usually a killer play.

Today was the first day in months that we saw extreme bear momentum maintained almost all day. The issue with the bear momentum is that when we have bull momentum the candles just rip green all day long, however, today we watched with selling volume increasing and at its extreme momentum that SPY continue to trend green for almost 2 hours straight. When we have an extreme like that we should not see the trend inverse it like we saw today‚Ä¶ it was one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt take the call play myself as I wasn‚Äôt sure if markets were setting up for a massive dump with the fake rally against momentum. 

Spy today rejected that 429.7 daily resistance level again and failed to reachout for the bear market resistance level. Overall we closed out with another gravestone doji. However, you can see that the last few times we have done this while it should dump the next day and be a sort of ‚Äútop‚Äù it actually has signaled a bottom. 

We are still riding within the red rising wedge. 

Key support- 

425.9 (red rising wedge support) -&gt; 422.9 (daily 8ema)

Key resistance-

427.3 -&gt; 429.8 (daily resistance level)

If I see a support test of 425.9 in the morning that holds I will be looking to play some calls without a doubt, however, if we break through this level I will look for puts and a bigger sell off continuation tomorrow.

Futures has a more convincing top with that doji from yesterday that formed a double top today.

I am growing more and more convinced the SPY and ES weeklies are putting in the top weekly candle right now‚Ä¶ both are formed with gravestone dojis. 

Key resistance remains at 432.8/ 4340. 

https://preview.redd.it/wvo5cy862ci91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=952867709c83fea66f413cbd9bb1cd704a341d11

Then we have our problem child Apple‚Ä¶ We saw apple BREAK through the bear market resistance line‚Ä¶ effectively apple just broke the 2022 trend of no higher highs‚Ä¶ however, we saw a pretty strong rejection there and the candle body closed AT the resistance of 174.5. So what does that mean for tomorrow? Well there is a theory that sometimes we see a huge fake push through resistance and that is followed by a pretty massive dump. There is also a theory that sometimes we fail the first resistance test and then have to go for round two. 

Which one will it be? We will find out tomorrow and Friday. 

All eyes on 174.5 tomorrow for Apple‚Ä¶ if we hold under that level and especially if we see a bigger sell off back to 173.3 range tomorrow then I am thinking today just put the top in. Again im not getting excited as we finally saw a nicer red day for SPY but apple closed super green‚Ä¶ Apple closing at 0.88% green while spy closed 0.71% red doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense‚Ä¶ especially when the rest of tech was pretty bloody too. 

Key support-

173.3

Key resistance

174.5

The VIX continues to trend for the 6th day in a row now near this 19.5 to 20.5 range failing to break down or out from here‚Ä¶ I still am waiting for that VIX breakout towards 22-23 before I get into long term puts‚Ä¶ we are close but not there yet.

Surface level‚Ä¶ I had a great day today‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt be any happier with my day trading today and this week‚Ä¶ 8 for 8 this week. Cant beat that right? 

But when I look at the volatility of today and the fact that I could have made 100-200% gains easily today and that I had plans to but failed to execute does hurt a little. The day played out nearly perfectly for what I expected. 

Sometimes I get in my own head and I look at too much information and I talk myself out of a high risk to reward play because of one indicator. I am still learning that I can trust myself again in this market‚Ä¶ those June to July months where everything look perfect and then we would see a massive 1% reversal out of no where still haunt me. 

But ignoring FOMC minute play‚Ä¶ this week has been great for me‚Ä¶ Thursdays have been my downfall the last 2 weeks and I look forward to changing that tomorrow.

Let's get to fundamentals: There are no fundamentals for the company, it is probably going to go bankrupt and the different options like selling off buy buy baby would also not save it from the inevitable doom.

So this is where it gets interesting, the company stock price has zero fundamentals backing it and is solely driven by APE energy.

Now , the stock market has been on a continuous uptrend for the past couple of months and most would agree that the rally is unsustainable.

The ones that keep rebalancing their portfolios during volatile times would usually get out of their positions in 'high risk' stocks and put it into industrials/defensive or in stocks like Apple and Microsoft to get more stability and not miss any recovery gains.

Now this may sound like really regarded advice, but right now the best bet and safest stock will be $BBBY, 
The stock has tremendous euphoria behind it and the FOMO is only going to increase, this will last atleast a month after which we may see some heavy bagholders or some people with Lamborghinis, noone can predict that, but what I would like to predict is the price being above 25 into September regardless of broader market action which will probably be negative.

So let me sum up the most regarded advice on the probably most regarded post here,

606,1660708195,wqep9t,1,"How can I siphon a single cent out of millions of people a day? seriously anyone that can do this would be rich. we live in a society where real estate is the best investment because you can supress anyone that doesn't own it simply because your name isn't on the loan or deed. There are a lot of worthless people out there that don't do anything for society and get paid a lot of money while everyday people actually run society while everyone else is just having fun with their lives. Celebrities, sports players, and people who make youtube and tik tok videos aren't needed and worthless in society.. they just do it on a large scale.

Bankers are legit fucking goddamn broke and don't actually have any money. Seriously think about it for a second.. you're telling me that I can deposit $3,000 in a bank account right now and then that bank leverages your money 100 times over and loans it out (aka they know there's enough money out there in bank accounts where not every single person is going to take it out at once so they can inflate the number of actual bank notes in existence and loan it out to people and make money off of your money). Why in the world can I not take a loan out of $300k for myself on this if it's so secure and pay very little interest? oh wait because the bank does it and needs to make money on top of the federal funds rate even though they are lending out your government debt notes that you have in your possession and have the audacity to charge you interest on it, charge late fees, charge fees if you go below $0 on your account. You're all fucking broke you, stupid bankers. Don't you dare think because we have a society set up to protect the rich and that money is the new form of survival of the fittest that you think you're better than me. Let's go to the woods and see who deserves life once and for all. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-MEF\_\_IOe8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-MEF__IOe8) you're broke bankers.

If you think about it, investing is the weirdest thing, but also at the same time the best thing. Investing regardless if it's good for society or not, has a good utility or not, is good for anything or not, is about making one's own self more capital. Investing or day trading penny pumper stocks is investing you're just hoping some poor old sap buys it off you. Everything is speculative. Even Apple is speculative because anything can happen. Investments are just backed by something underneath. So being speculative or not it's still investing in yourself but it also has an underlying benefit.. it makes a company more profitable hopefully and there for your investment was worth it. Nothing is done without someone else. Investing is great because anyone can do it. Anyone in the world, invest and you do the work yourself or you invest and someone else does the work. It's nice having the ability to invest and have other people do the work, it makes you better off of others' work. Companies and other people's work is nice to invest in people anyone can be a partial owner, but the weirdest part is that since anyone can be an owner.. the have a say in it. Someone that doesn't even shop at that store, buy that product or in any way use such service from a company or use such real estate can benefit.. anyone! I can buy ford Amazon stock and based off how the company is ran essentially force everyone in that company to work harder and be a better company. Driving down your road and complaining that someone sold their house at a lower cost that you don't like and bringing down the neighborhood property values. Essentially investing these days it feels like it would be the same as driving past a home being built and not liking how slow someone or fast but not fast enough or efficient someone is working and telling them to work more, faster and smarter. Writing a note to an employee to be better or I will vote your CEO or want your CEO to fire you because of needing more profit in my hands. It's insane that it's like that these days. Employees and every employee needs the ability to get more company stock to have more wealth around, they need to get paid more in general to live life. What's wrong with a market cap of $600B vs $550B?? They still are a successful company, can take out loans and grow and leverage, but they cannot pay their employees more to buy products in society and live happily. It's all we have is life. what's the difference of someone being worth $1B in cash vs $100M in cash they still enjoy live the same, why can't someone who actually does work to increase the companies worth more get paid more? CEOs don't do 347 times the work as an engineer or a cashier or a desk worker.. Warren Buffet isn't great, he just invested in companies and happens to be healthy. He's just the same old person who thinks Coke is a great company because of cash flow and doesn't care about if it's actually good for society or eats a McDonald's burger each day because he likes the business.. it's not healthy.. But investing is the way to improve society and yourself but it's not always good.

Siphoning money out of people is the way even if you're worthless and just a living sack of dusk in a human flesh bag. World doesn't make sense.

Well we are quickly eliminating resistance and support lines from the mix. Today we broke below that black dotted support line and we perfectly rejected the red solid rising wedge resistance AND the bear market resistance line while managing to close at the daily level resistance. Lots of resistance here huh? 

Tomorrow is where things will get interesting. 

Key support tomorrow-

427.2 -&gt; 424.8 -&gt; 423.5 (9 week bull support) 

Key resistance tomorrow-

429.8 (daily resistance level) -&gt; 431.4 (bear market resistance) -&gt; 434 (red rising wedge resistance)

Overall watching how we reacted here and the fact that we have no had 5 green days in a row (technically one of them was 0.00% but still 5 in a row green) I have a feeling tomorrow we are going to see a red day and test some supports down below. 

We have FOMC minutes tomorrow and while that does not always mean a red or green day usually from 2pm to 3pm we see a fairly big green move when the news it released. I posted to the server my game plane and will update my game plan tomorrow with the premarket post. 

I most likely will be looking for a back test of support down near 427.2 and potentially 424.8 if there seems to be a pretty big overnight or morning drop.

Futures daily looks a little different in that we broke through the blue resistance line of the rising wedge and we broke through support of it. However, today we did not see the bulls test the ES futures bear market resistance. We are seeing more of a doji daily candle finish for futures though compared to SPYs candle.

Resistance-

4330 -&gt; 4352

Support-

4300 -&gt; 4277

SPY weekly you can see we rejected the weekly resistance level of 431.7 very nicely today and the black dotted resistance line, however, failed to reach out and touch the actual weekly bear market resistance closer to 432.7.

Futures is about the same looking but we failed to touch the black dotted rising wedge and the bear market level. However, futures weekly is setting up more like a doji candle at this moment. 

https://preview.redd.it/l8o4ug9sd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9534dd6ec21ad064580c32095020f297e91ba3eb

Apple and tech in general today showed the most weakness of the whole market. With apple finishing red and SPY green. Most of the morning Apple showed a great deal of weakness. 

Currently we are seeing a double top with a doji which could signal a small pullback is warranted tomorrow. We are also seeing that 6 day long black solid rising wedge support broken through now. 

Key support-

172.1 -&gt; 171 (red dotted rising wedge)

Key resistance-

173.3 -&gt; 174 -&gt; 174.5 (bear market resistance)

On the SPY daily we had that massively tight and aggressive black dotted rising wedge form last week. Well today we saw SPY poke its head over that black dotted resistance line. We also perfectly rejected the 429.4 daily resistance level (that‚Äôs the yellowish tan horizontal channel). 

We also saw the support line of that pretty aggressive black dotted bull support line reconfirmed today at open. 

Overall tomorrow or Wednesday is shaping up to be the ‚ÄúD-Day‚Äù where we are finally going to reachout and touch that solid green bear market resistance line. Tomorrow if we get a bullish enough day we are going to test not only the black solid rising wedge resistance but we are also going to test the green solid bear market resistance line at the same time. Could be a very big make or break type of day with it only being 0.6% away from close today. 

Major resistances tomorrow- 

439.3 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431.8 (bear market resistance and black solid rising wedge resistance)

Interestingly enough the VIX bounced pretty high today. With a close at 20.34 Friday and an intraday high of 21.74 that was a pretty green open for the VIX. However, like usually throughout the day we saw the VIX slowly unwind and with that SPY go up and up. 

As I mentioned last week im looking for the VIX to break that resistance line and end up somewhere near 22-24 before I assume the top is in. 

Overall I will be looking for Spy to touch that 431.8 (daily) bear market resistance and the 432.8 (weekly) bear market resistance lines tomorrow. A hard rejection at either one of those should be assumed as a great put opportunity. I will be watching the daily level first. If we break through it but don‚Äôt break through the weekly we can assume the next day the weekly resistance will be taken down. However, if we get stopped in our tracks at 431.8 then I am assuming for the time being we are maxing out. 

With the bigger red open today and the early morning chop and weakness and the continued low volume trading I would not be surprised to see a little consolidation and back testing of support at 427.2 tomorrow and actually attempting bear market break out on Wednesday with the assistance of FOMC minutes at 2pm. FOMC minutes is usually a pretty bullish day and movement and we should suspect nothing less in this current environment we are in (TA has been posted to the server on how to trade Wednesday). 

10% challenge-

I didn‚Äôt sit down at the computer till closer to 930am this morning cause it was the kiddos first day of school so was playing a little catch up. Overall I was fairly patient today and only made two trades before I had to leave around 230pm. Short trading day for me but overall a good day. 

https://preview.redd.it/lejru4srzxh91.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d9743f1e9553377371ce5969f579dab24c38012

I know the server has been discussing this but premiums continue to move wildly abnormal. I took that put trade around 1030. I went green instantly and then red. I had my 25% stop limit set which should have triggered at 426.5ish, however, I approached there on a bounce saw about -23% then Spy fell back my direction by about 10 cents and all of a sudden I went from -23% to -10%. SPY then came back to me and I was green before my PUT hit the spot price that I entered at. I bailed pretty quickly on that just cause of the abnormal movement. It was extremely odd. 

My call was just as odd today but it was a TOS issue. I bought 25 contracts and when I sold my bot only showed that 1 contract sold, however, I had the profits from all 25 selling. Even my orders for TOS showed that only one sold. It was an odd day for sure. Thankfully finished all green. 

Days like today though I do not enjoy trading. I didn‚Äôt wanna take calls today cause it was at extreme overbought levels pretty much from 1115 to 1pm when it finally rested. I was comfortable taking the call around 2 when SPY reconfirmed the 8ema as support on the 15minutes and we were showing oversold levels with favorable volume. 

These bull days are even more intense and extreme then the 2021 bull rally was. I was comparing todays and especially Fridays movement to those of 2021 and even the really big days in 2021 (and even in early 2022) that we bullish SPY rested along the way. It would retest the 8ema and sometimes even drop a candle below it. However now we are just seeing these bullish days where the momentum goes green and it never stops and it pretty much negates every indicator out there. And the worse part about it is its not like we have extremely high volume where I can say well yeah everyones buying so it makes sense‚Ä¶ we are just not seeing anyone sell right now is the issue.

Burry's Scion Asset Management only held a $3.3 million stake in Geo Group, a new filing shows.

Scion owned $165 million of stocks at the end of March, excluding its Apple put options.

Michael Burry, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame, slashed his US stock portfolio to a single holding in the second quarter, a SEC filing revealed on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosed just over 500,000 shares of Geo Group worth $3.3 million. Geo invests in private prisons and mental health facilities, and commands a market capitalization of less than $900 million.

Close followers of Burry are likely to interpret his decision to effectively liquidate his portfolio as a bad omen. The hedge fund manager diagnosed the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" last summer, and warned owners of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were careening towards the ""mother of all crashes.""

More recently, he has cautioned investors not to get too excited about the recent rally in stocks, as previous downturns have seen lots of temporary rebounds before finding a bottom. 

Scion's portfolio comprised 11 stocks worth $165 million at the end of March, excluding bearish put options it held against 206,000 Apple shares.

The Scion chief has taken a knife to his portfolio in the past. He pared it from 20 holdings to six in the third quarter of last year, reducing its value from $140 million to $42 million in the space of three months.

Burry shot to fame after his billion-dollar wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in the book and the movie ""The Big Short."" He's also known for betting against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation fund last year, and for investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock.

619,1660496308,wob2gb,1,"Hi y‚Äôall! West coast Ryan here. I wanted to bring another short squeeze stock to everyone‚Äôs attention. The stock of interest is KOSS. For those of you who do not know. KOSS squeezed very hard as GME squeezed. Further KOSS has a very small float. Not sure the exact amount but I know for a fact KOSS has a lower float than most stocks discussed here. So what is the thesis for this company ? 

1. KOSS is an old school head phone company who has patents for all types of headphones. Well recently about two weeks ago, we received news that KOSS won a law suit against the most valuable company in the world (üçéüçè) for their patent. The lawsuit was about the design of the AirPods. KOSS claimed that they had the original design and hence won the case. Not much details about the case have been revealed regarding what KOSS gets out of it. However, I know royalties will be involved and to be honest, the company has a such a low market cap (80 million) that even a small royalty payment could be huge. Look at how much Apple makes off of AirPods alone. To further this case on the lawsuits, KOSS has other outstanding lawsuits against other audio companies (skull candy being one of them) for the same exact reason. All in all, based on royalties and compensations the stock could fly. Further the fee float is probably the smallest out of all of the meme stocks who squeezed and could set up for a massive gains. 

2. As we know BBBY AMC and GME (HODLING BBBY And GME) have been making moves and we all hope to continue these moves. KOSS will follow as it appears it‚Äôs in the same basket. Considering it‚Äôs price, float, and upcoming catalyst, this stock should be looked at by more of us. 

I know this wasn‚Äôt a complicated DD but any feedback would be appreciated as this is my first post haha. Thanks y‚Äôall!

620,1660353015,wn1eqg,1,"If you ask a trader ‚Äúwhat your favorite kind of day to trade is‚Äù you are going to get lots of different answers. Some people love (and can only trade) trend days others love choppy/ range days. 

For me my absolute least favorite days during this 2022 bear market to trade are trend days like today. The reason why is that fundamentals are pretty much thrown out the window and the price action doesn‚Äôt match the chart and fundamentals. Watching SPY sit in overbought territory all day long, set up for the perfect rest/ reversal and then blow through resistance like it wasn‚Äôt even there is one of the most frustrating things out there. 

Which brings me to my other frustrating side of this is that we have yesterday which was setup just like today was and came out guns a blazing in the morning and made me fully expect a bigger green day like today, however, as soon as you buy calls it drops and never recovers. Then you got days like today that follow it up where you cant even trust the price action cause of what happened the day before on nearly identical setup. I swear the MM just like to mess with us.  

The weirdest thing about today for me though was the IV rank. Generally speaking on a very bullish day like today as price goes up IV rank drops. However, there were quite a few times today where the IV rank actually raised while price raised. In addition, todays opening and end IV rank is higher than yesterdays IV rank which was a red day (0.00% but dumped during the day). This did mess with some premiums today as I know I had quite a few people in the server today that mentioned their 0dtes were moving a snails pace like 7dte. I know I had a 0dte put qued from about 1115 to noon and the premium despite the price action going away from it barely turned red‚Ä¶ I also watched a put at one point go up in premium as SPY went up too. It was very odd today. 

Okay now onto the TA!

Pretty big win for the bulls today. So lets cover the bull vs. bear case for next week and some highlights. 

A lot of people are talking about the 50% retracement mark which is at 421.08. Apparently this number is significant as most bear market rallies don‚Äôt break the 50% retracement level. Also, most bear market rallies have apparently averaged about 10-12% recovery and we are currently trending at 17.9% as of close of market today. So the question now becomes are we reaching the end of bear market rally or are we already in the next bull market? 

https://preview.redd.it/asinhgz5sdh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57db0a3f2de7be8011149748b2f4957fe9cff1f2

Borrowing this picture from u/gaur but it shows that we cleared the 50 fib and should be headed to the 60 fib which is around 434. This level is key and aligns with what I see on the daily too. Actually interestingly enough these fibs overall align with my levels I have on SPYs daily chart too. 

Bull case- we have closed over the daily 200ema with three candles now and today we saw that extreme bull momentum return that we had the two weeks before this one. We are slowly pushing through all the resistance lines. We are headed for the MAJOR resistance line of 432.2 on Monday. Why does this resistance line matter so much? Well this resistance line is the last higher lows from SPY. This uses the high of January 4th and March 29th to give us a resistance line which come Monday will be sitting at 432.2. Effectively if we were to cross over this line one could say ‚Äúbear market is over.‚Äù We would be well out of bear market territory and we would be inching closer and closer back to the ATH vs. the 52 week low. Now the real question will come when we touch this level. Do we break through it and continue a trek to 440 or 458? Its possible. If we were to continue trending bullish like we are now then I would suspect that we could see 458 by middle of September at the latest. 

https://preview.redd.it/qsvgl4x6sdh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e2bf8b5029552ed7a0b9068af410b1cc31f0bd0

If you look at this daily chart with no lines on it and compare the late 2020/ 2021 bull market to now you can see we actually are trending upward more rapidly then the 2021 bull market even did. The 2021 bull market trended over the daily 8ema and then would back test support and the 20 and 50ema ever few weeks or months. I suspect we are seeing a retail driven rally and that the rally is going to come to an end eventually. 

Bear case- Despite todays extreme bull momentum and push green the bulls are still showing weakness. This mornings price action was mostly driven by sellers not buyers and looking at the previous days from this week its hard to say that buyers are in control 100%. We have monthly opex on Friday and we also have FOMC minutes on Wednesday. I doubt fomc minutes will be a catalyst but it could be the excuse to shake the markets up and drop us. Markets are expecting a 50bps hike right now and if there is something at that meeting indicating a 75bps hike regardless this could sell us off. With MOPEX coming up we will finally see all those puts down below expire worthless. This august 19th opex is heavily weighted in puts. The MM know this and my theory is with this large run up we are going to see everyone rotate into calls and that‚Äôs when the next sell off comes starting Monday the 22nd. It would make sense to see a consolidation week here around 430 and then we finally drop. 

We still have two aggressive rising wedges playing out on the daily right now that eventually I envision coming to an end. 

Key supports for next week on the daily-

424.5 (black dotted rising wedge support) -&gt; 419 (red solid bull support) -&gt; 417.5 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 407.6 (daily 100ema)

Key resistance for next week on the daily-

427.3 -&gt; 429.4 (black dotted rising wedge resistance) -&gt; 430.6 (sold black rising wedge resistance) -&gt; 432.4 (green solid bear market resistance) -&gt; 438.1 -&gt; 446.5

The Futures daily chart shows a very similar picture however I almost think its more clear. We have the red bull channel (if you zoom out its more of a rising wedge tho) but gives us resistance Monday at 4295 and support at 4184. There is also the extreme black rising wedge we are in right now too that is 4290 resistance and support 4250. That key level I mentioned on spy (green resistance bear market line) is 4340. 

https://preview.redd.it/688gd6rasdh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e18a6c53a61fcc76b56bea700648cd72a737659b

SPY weekly we continue to trend in a pretty massive breakout/ down triangle. Key weekly resistance is going to be 432.7‚Ä¶ which interesting enough is the weekly level and the black dotted rising wedge resistance. Support is at 419.6 for this current 9+ week long bull channel. 

https://preview.redd.it/t2yih2acsdh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=402c786617b403b82f6d068a2b447f5c8cf4593d

Futures has a similar outlook with 4340 as weekly resistance and rising wedge resistance. Support for bull 9 week long bull channel is at 4192. 

Which ever of these weekly support or weekly resistance lines are broken first next week I suspect to be the trend for the rest of the month and beginning of September.

Amazingly apple is only 6.29% from its ATH‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs absolutely mind boggling when you think about the fact that we are in a bear market right now. It will be interesting to see what apple does next week. Apple is on a near vertical extend that has only accelerated as time has gone on. From June 13th to July 22nd we had a nice bull run but From July 26th to today Apple is on some unbelievably extreme bull rally.

For comparison Apple has rose 12.3% from July 26th to today over 13 trading days. While from June 13th to July 22nd it rose 13.6% over 24 days. Apple has covered almost the same ground upwards in nearly half the amount of time. Or a total of 25.9% over 37 trading days. 

For another comparison the March rally from March 14th to March 30th Apple rallied 19.6% over 12 days. 

This run Apple is currently on right now during a bear market is the same size and strength that Apple went on from October 2021 to December 2021. The only rally that Apple has been on of this size and strength is the July 2020 to September 2020 bear market rally (and yes it dumped immediately after). This might be the strongest and fastest/ biggest rally that Apple has ever been on since Covid 2020 crash. 

Key daily resistance for Apple next week-

174.1 (rising wedge black dotted resistance) -&gt; 174.7 (bear market resistance line) -&gt; 179.1

Key daily supports for Apple next week-

172.2 (black dotted rising wedge resistance) -&gt; 169.4 (red dotted support line) -&gt; 166.4 (red bull channel support)

The weekly chart for apple looks like someone forgot to change the printer ink and its only printing in green now. 

Key weekly resistance is 174.5 (weekly bear market resistance) and 176.6 (red bull resistance channel)

Key weekly support is 165.7 (bull weekly support)

The VIX continues to be more and more interesting everyday. We rejected again off that support line today. However, while the VIX didn‚Äôt continue to unwind SPY did continue to go up EOD today. We did see a close below that 19.7 top 2021 red trend line. 

I am going to be keeping an eye on the VIX to see if it gives us any sort of guide into if and when this bear market rally is over. If we were to see the VIX break over 21.5 and especially over 22 next week I would start considering that we MIGHT be in store for some downside. 

Overall my thoughts next week is we are for sure going to see the 430s. Whether or not we are going to see 440s after that remains to be unseen. While I believe the bottom is in‚Ä¶ I would be shocked that we don‚Äôt revisit the 370s to fill the gaps on the daily chart. We currently have three gaps down below on SPY. If we were to leave these behind, not fill them and just go back onto the next bull market for SPY I would be shocked. 

My overall plans for next week is to wait for 430s and wait for Apple to hit mid to high 170s. From there I will be looking at the VIX to signal the top is in. I would like to see the vix break over 23. I believe that would be the perfect storm. SPY touching 430-435, Apple touching 175+ and VIX back over 23+. From there I think some 60dte puts would be a golden ticket. 

The key IF you are going to play puts here long term and you are looking for the downside is to buy yourself some time. 30dte would pay like crazy if the drop is just as big if not bigger then the rise (remember in June we dropped 13% in 8 days and in April we dropped 17% in 15 days and 11.5% over 10days in February and of course in January we dropped 14% in 13 days. 

We should be looking for about a 13.88% drop over about 11.5 days. For perspective that would be say 435 on Tuesday August 16th  to a drop of 374.6 by September 1st. This would fill all the gaps on SPY. 

So like I was saying the key here is to buy yourself enough time. The perfect sell off and a 30dte is going to pay unbelievably well, however, if we chop on the way down and this isn‚Äôt the normal sell off you are going to need a 60dte. 

30dte with a 12% drop would be about 1400% on a way OTM put 

60dte with a 12% drop would be 478% on a way OTM put 

Just something to think about. The key about this though is to not be early. If you are early and we still have another week of rallying and we end up hitting 440 or 450 your puts going to be toasted. 

Hope you guys have a great weekend. Lots of good lessons this week.

SPY closed out the daily perfectly even at 0.00%... very interesting.

SPY still running as strong as ever with our second candle and our first FULL candle closed over the daily 200ema. With the morning gap now filled here EOD there is an equal case for bulls and bears here. 

We are still trending in the red bull support pushing us up on the daily. Closing over the daily 200ema is bullish, however this whole week we have seen quite a bit of weakness start to develop. This is not the face melting green bull momentum intraday we have seen over the last 2 weeks prior. However, after hours we are getting some pretty impressive pushes green. 

The one interesting thing is that despite 5 of the last 6 trading days being red (if you count todays 0.00% as red) we actually are up 1.5% total over those 5 days‚Ä¶ 

We very well could see a gap fill day tomorrow with the amount of weakness we saw today. That gap is sitting at 412.75 for a nice 1.7% drop tomorrow. Since June 29th we have only had two daily closes that were over 1% red, it will be interesting going into the weekend if we see the bears get their close.

Not only that but if you remember on the weekly chart 415 is a KEY support level. If we close under that I lean bearish for next week. 

Key supports-

420 -&gt; 417.5 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 416.8 (bull channel support) -&gt; 414.6 -&gt; 412.2 (gap fill)

Key resistance-

The weekly is telling a more bullish story compared to the daily. Today we saw the bulls break through the rising wedge resistance at 422.8 that break through should be a gateway to upside, however, after the pretty large sell off today the bulls now have to defend 415 tomorrow to close over that key weekly level. This 415 level is the bearish to bullish line in the sand for next week. Over it I look for 430‚Ä¶ under it I look for 400 and below. 

https://preview.redd.it/mtle2f15b5h91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57d30040b1f0739c85aaf46eeebe9ce823ea68d7

Lately futures has been doing an excellent job of predicting the future‚Ä¶ what is it predicting right now? Well it just put in a MASSIVE gravestone doji. Probably the biggest and best looking gravestone doji I have ever seen on the futures or spy chart (actually August 2nd on SPY had a similar candle but a much different setup). There has not been a setup like this on the daily charts all year. 

If you wanna know why I think its so important then look here on the intraday 15min chart at the 1015 and 115pm candles.  

https://preview.redd.it/8i4ru9s5b5h91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8602e68bf52740eceeb0f6a38417e8912ec88810

As you can see these gravestone doji candles when seen at the top are usually massive reversal candles. 

Now don‚Äôt get too excited yet. Why? Because if we see bulls step back in tomorrow with some extreme bull volume then none of this is going to matter. Sheer volume can easily out weigh any technical pattern. Today wasn‚Äôt a bad volume day overall with 60mil and about 85%+ of the 30 day average. 

ES support-

4210 -&gt; 4184 -&gt; 4157 (this is the bull support‚Ä¶ #1 key support to watch)

ES resistance-

ES weekly is the same story as SPY. We broke through that resistance line on the weekly, however, we immediately retraced. 

Key support is that weekly level of 4160.

The VIX continues to be a thorn in my side. I just cant seem to get that thing to leave me alone. She continued to hold that key 19.7 level I mentioned yesterday. Instead of unwinding we actually saw it almost touch 21 again. Should we get excited? No I wouldn‚Äôt get put excited until we see 22-23 again and really sell it breaking that resistance line. 

10% challenge-

For the last 3 weeks I have had the hardest time flipping and staying bullish knowing that we had so much BS coming and just how overall ran up we were. With good CPI and a green open i was finally buying the bull momentum‚Ä¶ and turns out I shoulda just stayed a bear. 

Took what looked like a good call scalp entry pretty much right before that massive 11am dump. After the last 3 weeks had similar morning dumps before pushing higher and how over sold the stochs were I married my play and that was the wrong choice. Gotta love picking the red day during the rally‚Ä¶.

Overall that was my first red day trade this week. Not the end of the world but still failed to cut it at -20% like I know I should. Seems like I really struggle with fully committing to that so im going to be opening an OCO -20% trailing stop on my plays from now on so that I don‚Äôt have to do it myself. This gives me room to let my play run to green and take profits in the green but protects me from a massive 11am dump like today. Historically this dumps are the ones that burn me the most. Adding this down side protection will be good. 

Overall good entry‚Ä¶ poor execution on closing it when it went against me.

624,1660242310,wlyfk8,1,"I've been deep into WBD research since the merger trying to find the buying time and when is the right time to let out a rallying cry. The time is now friends. TA was screaming last week before earnings so I traded May 1 - May 5 with calls 15$-17.50$  and now is the time to get in as a poor earnings call from the CEO provided a buying opportunity (13.74$ WBD). 

This is HBO, Warner Brothers Pictures, DC Comics and all of their superheroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Joker, Harley Quinn etc), Cartoon Network and all of their IP, Adult Swim, Looney Tunes, and the list goes on, Literally the best content OWNED by the company providing it (this will be huge if Warner Brothers ever choose to change strategies and pull their content from other platforms).

it was a very smooth ride to 17.50$ right up earnings but was a disaster due to the CEO missing KEY points on things that are happening and are about to happen with the success of the Multiversus game on all platforms getting 10m download in 3 weeks BEFORE it's even been released, The Sandman show being the biggest show on Netflix but was produced by Warner Brothers and is a DC Comic, Game Of Thrones: House of Dragons is about to break watch records, Black Adam comes out this quarter with the Rock.

All the debt is now baked into the price after that earnings call 100%. If they paid off 4b-6b in debt and the debt is now a part of the stock price, you can now add that percentage of debt paid to the value of the stock from this point on. 5b in debt paid adds 10% in pure value to the stock price from 13.50, this will continue every quarter, and the percentage will be higher each quarter as the debt is reduced.  
Now that the Debt is baked into the price at 13.50$ and the debt paid is added as pure value each quarter, this allows the calculation of value added for FUTURE PERFORMANCE which wasn't possible last quarter due to this being the first quarter the company has ever been reported as a whole.

So the performance of HBO MAX VS. what the other streamers Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Apple are going to do this quarter can finally be reflected in the share price.  


So when Game of Thrones House of Dragons brings back 10m subs from years ago, and when Multiversuses finally releases with Season 1 of their hit game that broke 10 million downloads BEFORE it's even been actually released ( OPEN BETA releasing this month), and when Netflix reveals that The Sandman a Warner Brothers / DC Comic based show is their number 1 show, and when Black Adam with the Rock breaks the box office in October.....  


All of that can be finally added to the price of the stock. I have no regrets so far, I'm holding my calls LONG and hard baby. My only regret was expecting more from the CEO during the earnings call in terms of delivering news of what is to come. The call could have been handled much better, but the assets are still the same gold they have always been with all the bs finally brought into the light to be dealt with. 

 Oh ya, and everyone forgets the  Game of Thrones effect. Game of Thrones: House of Dragons is a SERIES, so the mass increase in subs that comes is pretty much a permanent increase in subscribers that will lead to an overall increase as they tell their friends how they can't live without HBO Max for the next 8-10 Years while House of Dragons airs.",WBD is ready.. everything is baked in and set to dominate the quarter..,1.0,2022-08-11 18:25:10

I am a little perplexed by today to be honest.. we opened 1.8% green and total today we only moved about $3.42 total which is 53% of the 10day average range of $6.4... We also failed to even hit the 30day volume average. Are bulls still exhausted? Is this a buying the rumor sell the news type of event? 

Tomorrow will be pretty interesting to watch. We obviously saw weakness earlier this week and end of last week. However, its clear that people are still buying but now that we got the CPI news what is the next bullish catalyst to push us up? 

https://preview.redd.it/wleu2e3s7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e98a84f02d12badfe6ca263c5dc0139569100f3

SPY has an impressive rising wedge forming on the daily (solid red lines). We rejected it perfectly today. I am surprised we did not break through this resistance today as this felt like an easy layup for the bulls to take spy to a 3% plus green day. 

Next major resistance I have is at 421.1 and then 423.7. 

One key takeaway I have from today is that we did back test the daily 200ema and we are holding that support very well. I do favor that as a bullish omen for the markets. 

We are seeing an impressive $3.97 gap on the daily though. We now have three pretty large daily gaps with two down near 370s and now this one in the 410s. 

https://preview.redd.it/dmmxq3qs7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43305755af44e1c3c5f2c2ee2055dcd72f9e2ef

Spy weekly is looking pretty bullish though. We have held the weekly 9 week long bull channel support and now we are looking to test this weekly rising wedge. Resistance for the weekly to watch is 423 and key support is now 415. 

If we continue to trend like this I have little hesitation in saying that we touch the 430s next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/xmhj7dct7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1013900f7b2941c50e5caafcf0e0fac10b7c22d8

ES futures is in the same boat. Key resistance remains at 4223 for the rising wedge and then 4275 for the next rising wedge. 

Support is now at 4184 the daily 200ema followed by 4140. 

https://preview.redd.it/hkuao6yt7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4899599e98b6cb8605ca97329dd67c52d4f2f56

Futures weekly never did confirm the bull support however we are not trending over that weekly resistance level of 4163. A close over that and I do suspect that we see 4300s next week. 

Rising wedge resistance is 4232 and support is that 4163 level tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/yoeyoeku7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebf8a53de06faaae4ad702c0cd8cb90ffae5cd57

Apples like that gold fish that no matter how neglected it is, how often you feed it, how often you don‚Äôt change the water, or how often the cat tries to eat it‚Ä¶ that mofo just don‚Äôt quit. 

Apple broke through the rising wedge (this is the one that spy/ es rejected today‚Ä¶ omen for tomorrow? Most likely) and closed over the support level of 168.9. 

From here apple is on a mission to test the bear market resistance level of 173-174.5 depending on how quickly we get there. We now have two MASSIVE gaps on the Apple daily. We have a $1.86 gap from July 29th and then todays $1.08 gap. When will we fill these gaps? This week? Next week? 2023? Who knows at this point‚Ä¶ Apple on a mission for green and I hesitate to bet against that. 

Key resistances- 171.8 -&gt; 172.8

Key support- 168.9 -&gt; 166.5 -&gt; 164.9

The VIX has just continued to go lower and lower and lower. I am a little impressed that it bounced directly off my falling wedge support line though and that it didn‚Äôt dump into the 18s today. However, the VIX is on an almost 9 week long unwind. 

Interestingly enough the bounce today is at the median high level that the VIX spent most of its time at in 2021. The low end is closer to 15.5. If we continue to see the VIX unwind we are going to be looking at a new possible range of 15.5 to 19.75. 

Historically I would say most of 2022 has been spent between 18.6 and 25.5 or 25.5 and 34.7. I would even venture to say that most of 2022 has been spent well over 25.5‚Ä¶. Is there a reversion to mean expected here? Do we short term revert or do we long term revert? 

10% challenge-

Overall today and really this week has been a great week for me. I was swinging that Apple put that I averaged down yesterday. I did attempt to close it EOD yesterday but it didn‚Äôt fill missed it by about 10 cents‚Ä¶ I was already down over 50% at EOD yesterday. I was able to closer it at open before the IV crush for -84.3%. Overall im still at 1.5x weekly profits with that loss. 

I am continuing to capitalize on quick scalps using the 1min/ 5min HA candles with STOCH and VOLD/VOLSPD 1min HA candles. The 20/50emas here have been gold for me. 

https://preview.redd.it/r4rprh1w7yg91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc5d4a6ac354ff3ab23eb5e50de0ddae975a9e8f

Aim small miss small. I am currently 9 for 9 on plays this week and my only red play is that swing play that I opened last week. Overall its been a great week. 

Today was a tough one to trade because we had such extreme bull momentum, however, the candles were moving at snail pace all day. Going to be interesting to see what tomorrow brings. 

On one hand this feels like the bulls are exhausted and gives me May FOMC vibes where she dumped like a mofo the next day and on the other hand this felt like a premarket run followed by consolidation all day. EOD I saw some crazy buying coming in on VOLSPD and VOLD. Very organized and consistent buying, however, SPY barely budged and even sold off at the end‚Ä¶ I wonder if we just saw a ton of shorts cover EOD. 

Remember in this market guys we don‚Äôt need to go for homeruns. We don‚Äôt need to play every single candle. A 10% win that you let turn into a -20% loser is actually a 30% loser‚Ä¶ Be smart out here.

But look, I looked. I looked at Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and your mom. I've got mom fetishes like I got 10-Q fetishes, and the generals--the kings of the Nasdaq? They're getting old. They had their best years. What do you think covid represented? The peak of technology. You think it gets better from here? AWS gonna keep breaking records? Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me ""the chicken comes home to roost."" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a fa√ßade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Enough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, ""but that's another topic"" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**

&amp;#x200B;

**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost. All the liquidity be sucked up, fed fund at 125 bps higher than today, and maturities of bonds without reinvestment**

 **You'll see, and it'll probably be after you do anything about it.**

Today we had huge bull energy in the morning and double double topped (15minute chart) there and aggressively sold off.

The one thing I am seeing over the last 2 weeks now going on 3 weeks is that after about noon there is very little worth trading on SPY. It gets beyond choppy and unpredictable.

Now if we are going to get the big red day its going to come around 1pm tomorrow‚Ä¶ the last four CPI days have had some massive drops from 1pm till EOD.

Overall I know this daily chart looks hella busy but its worth it‚Ä¶ heres what im seeing‚Ä¶

Bearish- We broke out today over the 414.4 key resistance level from Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. However, we hard rejected the daily 200ema at 417.5 and saw a big dump afterwards.

Bullish- We broke through the resistance line from Wednesday and Thursday.

Bullish- despite the sell off we held key support of 412 AND did not fall through the bull channel support (blue line)

Bearish- historically the two days before CPI we see a fairly large sell off with the last 4 CPIs having about a -2.61% average drop (over the two days). We could be seeing that drop start and possibly get our first -2% day since June. 

Key supports tomorrow-

413.5 (blue bull channel) --&gt; 411.3 (red bull channel) --&gt; 407.5 (daily 100ema and key support from last week)

Key resistances tomorrow-

414.5 --&gt; 417.4 (daily 200ema)

Overall the two most important levels to watch is first 413.5. This 413.5 level is the 9 week long bull channel support. If we lose that 413.5 we need to keep our eyes on 407.5‚Ä¶ if we close below that 100ema its time to get into some puts. I think this is starting to play out pretty perfectly for a big CPI dump‚Ä¶ 

However, if the bulls come back in with big volume tomorrow and try to run this up before CPI we are going to look for that 417.5 retest there‚Ä¶ closing over or under the daily 100/ 200ema will be a big deal tomorrow and likely will predict where the next week of trading goes‚Ä¶ in the chance they range us all day then we wait for Wednesday.

Key supports-

4150 (9 week long bull channel support) --&gt; 4127 (red bull channel short term) √† 4095

Key resistance-

4157 --&gt; 4182 (daily 200ema) --&gt; 4202

For futures I am going to be watching 4150 all night long‚Ä¶ if we wick over that tonight I suspect we see SPY break that level tomorrow too and we see a retrace over the next week or so.

SPY/ Es futures weekly both showing the same rejection with a pending sell off trend as back in May/ June (which was also right before CPI). Overall we are seeing that 415/ 4164 remains key resistance levels on the weekly to watch. 

Key support is 408.6/ 4100

https://preview.redd.it/0am3u7jdxjg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce87c69def5b166a2bee83d8cc1bf2fc5deabea

Not a lot of new on the Apple chart but we are seeing some strong resistance being established here at 166.3. That will continue to be a key level to watch if we try to push higher. However if the bigger CPI sell off comes in then we get to start looking towards the 157.64 gap fill (which my now 5dte puts really are hurting for). 

Key support will be 163.1 --&gt;160.8 tomorrow (160.8 breaks the 9 week long bull channel)

Key resistance will be 168.2 --&gt; 169 --&gt; 170.2

This weekend I reviewed my trading log from last week and the common denominator was my first two trades every day were very green and had I just quit then I would have ended up 3-4x my weekly goal, but instead I traded more and got burnt and finished red. Today I had a nice win on my first trade for 22% and then I followed it up with a call play that was only 0.9% should have been closer to 6% but my limits kept not filling on TOS for some reason (of course later it was nearly 50%). But my lessons I learn along the way I take to heart. 

If you aren‚Äôt constantly replaying days, and weeks and seeing what you missed or what you could have done differently then you are handicapping yourself. Some people say ‚Äúwell you have so much criteria that needs to be met to enter a trade you may only enter 1 a day.‚Äù And to that I say‚Ä¶ whats the rush? Why do you NEED to enter more then one solid 10% winning trade a day? Hint‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt. Less is more sometime.

After the morning there just was not my setup nothing that filled and checked every box I needed to enter a trade. In my server today I mentioned that. I said that every trade should be treated as our first‚Ä¶ if that trade doesn‚Äôt check every box for entering criteria then don‚Äôt enter. Just cause you won once doesn‚Äôt mean you will again.

Today was even more impressively frustrating as from 11am until 1145am on SPY and from 11am until noon and 2pm until 245pm on VOLSPD the bears had locked in what we call extreme momentum. This was the first extreme bear momentum I have seen in weeks. Usually once a level of extreme momentum like this is locked in it takes a big move to get that momentum to break, however, the bulls both times broke that momentum and 180‚Äôd this. 

The dips are still call buying opportunities‚Ä¶ the MM are just getting better and better at selling these red days and trapping the bears. 

So a few very interesting things to note that has changed from last night around 7pm until now‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/ptq8o70xwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e4286a69147842e5d8949343ff3d95063e27bc

Last night markets had price in an 87% chance of a 50bps hike for the September meeting after this mornings employment numbers the market now is nearly 50/50 whether it‚Äôs a 50bps or 75bps hike. Was that unbelievable drop pre market the market pricing it in already? Or does that still need to be priced in? Will markets not care until CPI Wednesday? So there is this too which is interesting‚Ä¶

I took this picture last night of the expected CPI when I was making my CPI post‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/zydhdxlxwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30745cfa02d835c76a22ff01aa3e31c498596d33

Check out the consensus‚Ä¶ they actually today (at some point) lowered the expected CPI consensus by 0.2%. I find this very odd and suspicious to say the least that they lowered the expected CPI consensus so close to CPI. 

I have two theories on todays actions‚Ä¶ 1. The employment numbers clearly caught the MM and markets as a whole by a big surprise‚Ä¶ I mean this opening was more red then GDP confirming a recession and gave CPI a run for its money. I believe todays action (especially looking at things like IV rank) shows the MM had today already priced in as a bullish day. It would explain a lot of what happened intraday today. 2. The markets/ feds (whoever you think is in control) realized that with a huge employment number like this with an expected terrible CPI (forecast is 9.1%) markets are panicking. They are doing everything they can to keep this market from crashing into the abyss. 

Think about it whats really driving this current bear market rally? Overall after the last CPI and last FOMC markets are pretty much under the impression that the feds about to pivot in September. This is why the GDP/ recession and last CPI is being shrugged off and why you don‚Äôt hear the ‚Äúpanic‚Äù talk much anymore about the next rate hike, cpi, etc. etc. However, today was the first time the markets really said wow with numbers like this feds aren‚Äôt going to pivot and the rate hikes aren‚Äôt done yet. Markets are late to react (usually one day) to new like this and I believe we could see that reaction Monday and Tuesday. We have CPI on Wednesday and I think that‚Äôs going to be a big deal‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still working off the impression that we are consolidating like we did from May 27th until June 8th before the CPI dump. If this is true then Monday (Tuesday at the latest) should start a pretty impressive and aggressive sell off. 

This last week has also set up a pretty large symmetrical breakout/ down (red lines) triangle that will most likely play out Monday if not Tuesday at the latest. Key support is 410.3 (which breaks the overall 8 week long bull channel) and resistance is 413.9. 

We are still stuck right between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema and we need to pretty much wait for one of this to hard break before we can finally see if we are going to 430 or 390s. 

It is important to note that we have not put in a new high since Wednesday so we are starting a lower high trend. If we once again reject that red solid resistance line at 413.9 Monday then I would feel more confident that we are going to drop next week. 

Key levels to watch next week remain the 100ema at 407.5 and the 200ema at 417.4. Overall nothing is happening until one of those is broken. 

https://preview.redd.it/728od8hzwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b061604c029e31bee552aafa1e8365e17f4268a

The ES futures daily chart is looking similar yet a little different. I said yesterday ‚Äúwe are here‚Äù referring to the June 27th/ 28th candles and had we not had that ridiculous bull run at open and had we crashed down EOD like was expected we would have finished nearly identical to those days. However, we put in yet another doji on the daily. 

The bulls were able to reconfirm bull channel support tho at open and still haven‚Äôt broken that 8 week long support line. 

We here too are stuck between the daily 100ema at 4085 and daily 200ema at 4184.

The symmetrical triangle in play here too shows support at 4115 (which breaks bull channel) and resistance at 4158 (key resistance for the last 3 days) for Monday. 

Futures did finally break that extreme bull momentum support line that I mentioned I suspected would happen today since SPY broke its yesterday. 

https://preview.redd.it/hye8ee40xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141e25ae9398701552d16d5f5147c6812d46a156

Overall the weekly SPY and ES futures charts are looking very similar. I am highlighting the May 31st weekly candle here on both SPY and ES. I am looking for a similar pattern to play out next week. This week we attempted to break out of this 415/ 4162 weekly level resistance. We tested this resistance numerous times this week, however, we failed to close over this key weekly resistance every day this week. 

I am also seeing that this May 31st weekly candle is the week before June CPI. Which also plays further into line of expectations that Monday and Tuesday is going to lead to a big sell off going into CPI on Wednesday. This would now be the 5th weekly candle to attempt to and fail to break this 415/4162 level. 

We may open Monday red and just drill all week but I suspect Monday we test this level one more time. A rejection here should result in further downside. 

Key support for the now 8 week (9 week starting next week) bull channel is 409.1/ 4100. If and when that support is finally blown through I suspect a large selloff fuel by CPI. 

If you read my CPI document you know I expect blood next week. Whether we get that or not? Well that‚Äôs a different story. The bulls are still beyond in control its not funny. At every possible weak breaking point they manage to muster together some unexpected strength. 

https://preview.redd.it/4t2usgf1xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc505d116a451d151fb27186fa0cad8e5091b236

Apples daily chart is still looking hella bullish with them too refusing to give up any of this relentless bull momentum. However, like SPY yesterday Apple broke the week long extreme bull momentum support line. That‚Äôs the first strike the next strike is going to be breaking that bull bull channel support line. 

Now despite the bull strength today the daily chart is still looking like we are putting in a teepee (the opposite of a v bottom) top. With the big run up, a doji and now a lower candle I suspect this COULD be the start to the top. 

I will be watching closely Monday for this blue support line at 159.8 and the red resistance line at 164.6. Apple has been even putting in large green days or small +/- 0.5% days for the last 8 weeks (minus maybe 2 bigger red days). Overall its going to take some pretty big news to put apple in the ground (it did open down 1.6% today which was a good start‚Ä¶). 

The trend as you can see is Apple puts in a high then has about 2-3 days of small drops before it puts in a massive green day. If this trend continues we should see a small retrace before Tuesday is big green, however, if markets can break this trend and we break that key 159.8 blue bull support line we might finally fill that gap. 

https://preview.redd.it/rpesu332xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1d4facffa650e00ac2f1d7a09089f16d12a379

There really isn‚Äôt a whole lot to be said about apples weekly besides this 8 week channel is hella impressive. This is actually Apples first 5 green weeks in a row since October 2021. It is also the most impressive bull run Apple has had since Covid recovery‚Ä¶

Weekly support is 160.8 and resistance is 172. 

https://preview.redd.it/nw96b3r2xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef5eea1d6576506e48903ed7c5214ac9ad09634

The VIX continues to impressively unwind. This week with CPI we are either going to see the VIX finally go back to 30 or we are about to see the VIX go back to 15.

Overall this was actually a great week for me. I had a good time getting back to me taking these quick scalps. 

The biggest L this week came on Wednesday when I let a put run to -73% and refused to close it at -30% when it felt like it wasn‚Äôt coming back and then not closing it at -50%. I held onto this loser WAY too long (I didn‚Äôt accept how strong the bull momentum was at the time) and that turned a GREAT week into a red week. Overall I am happy with how my week went, the play I made and my win rate. Had I cut this loser it would have changed my week from red to green. I continue at times to take losses fast enough. 

Today was a good day with 3 nice scalps. My only regret was that 1dte put. I took it before the mid day reversal (when momentum was at the bear extreme) I hit about 10% profits, however, my conviction based on what I saw was so high I didn‚Äôt take profits as I suspect we would see a retest of 409‚Ä¶ as you can see how the day went that did not pan out very well for me‚Ä¶ I was unsure whether to let this ride to Monday or not. I would need a 409 breakeven Monday in order to see green. 

I weighed the risk to reward on this on whether It would be better to salvage this and use the money Monday or whether I thought we would open and drill right to 409 to make it worth holding. In the end I chose to mitigate the loss. This was another good lesson for me that no matter how strong my conviction is and no matter what im seeing and how good it looks and how strongly everyone else also sees what I see‚Ä¶ always protect profits. 

In the end I had a great week and felt like myself again this week for the first time in a while. I look forward to next week. 

Remember to always have a plan, protect profits, and never get greedy. This market is chewing up and spitting anyone out who remotely get greedy or who thinks they are smarter than the MM is. Overall, protect your profits and protect your portfolio‚Ä¶ there are better times ahead of us. 

Have a great weekend guys!

The tech company told its suppliers that products or parts made in Taiwan must be identified as made either in ""Taiwan, China"" or ""Chinese Taipei"" to avoid indicating that the island is independent of China, the Japanese business news outlet said.

According to Nikkei, Apple made the decision in order to avoid possible supply chain disruptions from Chinese scrutiny over the labels, especially as the company prepares to receive components from Taiwan that will be used for new products slated to launch later this year.

Some iPhone components were held for review on Thursday to see whether the shipments were labeled to China's satisfaction, Nikkei reported.

Apple did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment ahead of publication.

Apple's warning comes only a few days after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traveled to Taiwan in a visit that prompted a strong reaction from China. The nation has claimed Taiwan as its own for decades, even though China has never controlled the self-governed democratic country.

Pelosi's actions were seen by Beijing as a ""major political provocation"" and a challenge to China sovereignty, Hua Chunying, China's assistant minister of foreign affairs, said on Twitter. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned ahead of the visit that the Biden administration would get ""burned."" Beijing also launched a series of military drills around Taiwan in response.

Pelosi has been outspoken in her support of Taiwan's independence.

As you can see we have finally broken the 7 day long extreme momentum bull support. Now that does not mean that we broke the full bull channel support it just shows that the extreme bull momentum that started on July 27th until yesterday has been broken. We still have the overall 8 week long bull channel support which will be at about 408.7 tomorrow. 

There are a couple things to point out from today that are key in my opinion. 

This was the lowest volume day of the year which either means we finally saw bulls exhaust themselves or it means no one is ready to buy here but no one is ready to sell here either as they are indecisive of whether we are going higher or lower next.

We are still trading between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema which overall is neutral and I have since last week said that which ever one of those breaks first is the way we are going to go. 

The bears clocked a really nice double top doji in today with 415.6 being the major resistance point. Overall my expectation is that we have another red day tomorrow where we are going to trade between 415.6 and 408.1 (at the extreme). From there I will be looking at the sell off to start on Monday next week before CPI comes on Wednesday August 10th. I highlighted the Friday and Mondays before the last four CPIs and almost all of them the Friday before was the peak. I am working on my CPI post right now and that should be up later tonight too. Overall I am planning to go in on puts EOD tomorrow. 

Now in the off chance that we see bulls come back in with some good volume tomorrow and break that 415.6 resistance level they are going to need to capitalize on that momentum and close over the daily 200ema in order to continue the bull trend next week. Failing to break the daily 200ema tomorrow and especially a hard rejection there tomorrow would all but secure a bearish week next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/mf2t3kflurf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c52ee01b17f6e0e5f7ad0288f21705cb763ad5fe

ES Futures is looking pretty similar, however, its extreme bull trend has not been broken yet and that support will be at 4139 and be key to watch not only over night but intraday tomorrow. Its key resistance to watch will be at the 4177 level and their daily 200ema is at 4183. If bulls fail to break these levels tomorrow it looks like we are seeing the rising wedges fail and I fully expect some down side. 

https://preview.redd.it/k1fc6pamurf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f819667ba9d69dc6c19c0c078d9f378de06eb99

The main takeaway from the weekly charts is that the 415 and 4164 levels continue to remain heavy resistance. We saw a very aggressive rejection there twice this morning and once during power hour today. I suspect that we are going to continue to see this rejection and I will favor downside next week if bears can close under those key levels. 

https://preview.redd.it/3wrejnknurf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=904955441d8a2fc971139c485f83ce1bbbf4a722

After apples pretty impressive day yesterday it was pretty much a bust today. The most important takeaway from Apple today is that we saw it close out a doji and maintain 166.2 as key resistance. It also failed to break its rising wedge resistance. As you can see by the ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù highlighted with arrow I am expecting a pullback tomorrow and early next week to retest that red line bull channel support down near 161. However, for tomorrow 164.6 remains key support for the bulls to hold. If we see that support break (this support is similar to the one SPY broke today) then we are going to be looking for the next sell off.

659,1659642772,wgaiq6,1,"Block, Inc., formerly Square, Inc., is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.

Consider the fact that the company's stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&amp;P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.

**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**

https://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq

Square on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. 

In its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.

Cash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.

**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**

At the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.

Square is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square's gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.

Square and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.

**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**

In a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.

""Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term,"" he wrote.

Announced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging ""[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)"" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM). Some investors questioned whether Block needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the buy now, pay later market. Block's 2022 guidance includes an expected $1 billion in Afterpay operating expenses. UBS analyst Rayna Kumar in a report said the ""risk profile"" of Afterpay has changed amid rising interest rates and the potential of increased regulation.

Square stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.

**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**

For merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there's still a risk of defaults.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App's direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.

Square is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.

The Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company's subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.

To broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma's tax business for $50 million in cash. It's a free service for consumers.

**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**

With roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved ""upmarket,"" targeting larger businesses.

SQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).

In addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.

Square recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.

**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**

The company's Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.

Meanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.

Square on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.

In trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.

One key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume ‚Äî total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers ‚Äî also known as GPV. It's a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.

**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**

Square earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.

Square said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.

Financial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.

Gross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.

In a letter to shareholders, management said: ""Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square.""

Excluding Afterpay, the company said ""gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year.""

**Block Stock Technical Analysis**

After its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.

That soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google in stature.

Following its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019.

Compared to November 2021 when Nasdaq peaked, today the rates are up, dollar is up and oil is up. Historically, this has been a terrible combination for forward corporate earnings. Incredibly talented 21-year old Wall Street fortune tellers who have never seen anything like this environment mark the next year's earning expectations for Apple, the biggest company in SP500, at up 5%. Earnings estimates for some other noteworthy companies look similar if not higher.

If the history rhymes, the corporate earnings are prone to suffer by at least 10-20% if the rates, dollar and oil stay at their respective current levels but no one seems to be positioned for it. And I have not even mentioned the probability of sustained periods of inflation so far if you noticed.

Do whatever you will with this information but know that these things take time to play out, usually 6-12 months. Do not expect instant reward/gratification, 0DTE SPY puts is not the way to play this.

Apple had an implied move of $2.01 with a improbable high of 162.84‚Ä¶ for those of you who don‚Äôt know IV prices in movement everyday and overall it provides probable and improbable ranges‚Ä¶ generally speaking even touching the improbable high is RARE let alone going over it‚Ä¶

So today we saw apple have a total DTR (daily true range) of 5.84 which is 290% of the implied IV move. It was also 144% of the average 10day range and 134% of the 30day average range. It reached nearly $4 over its improbable high of day. This is one of the most imbalanced and ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù moves I have ever seen on apple.

This was the greenest close apple has had since May 27th. As you can see looking very interesting on the daily‚Ä¶ 

We have officially broke out of the red rising wedge. We are now working on another black dotted rising wedge. This one uses early June dates for the resistance line. Today Apple perfectly hit that. It uses the last 7 trading days support for the support line. 

This pattern gives a high of 167.6 and a low of 162.9. We still have that gap down below also on Apple but we are obviously getting further and further away form that gap. 

https://preview.redd.it/tus6p2pk8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=200c1bda0bb87c211cf2e9ecec02b9dc8d81e5e5

Apple weekly chart broke its resistance line today too for the overall down trend and now all that is left is the resistance of the overall market which uses January 3rd and March 28th weekly highs as resistance. That gives us a possible upside of 174.5 next week. 

Overall if this extreme bullish momentum keeps up there is a case to be made for apple 175 next week.

Overall SPY and Futures are putting in some crazy looking rising wedges‚Ä¶ some of the tallest and most extreme rising wedges I have seen in a while on the daily. 

Currently you can see on SPY we have the purple dotted resistance line which we rejected perfectly today. It uses the July 29th and June 28th daily candles for resistance. Resistance for tomorrow will be at 416.7

The black dotted resistance line uses July 29th, July 8th, July 7th and June 29th for resistance. This give sus a resistance of 418.8 tomorrow. 

And then we have the red dotted resistance line from June 28th, June 15th and June 13th which gives us resistance of 423.5 for tomorrow. 

We have three potential rising wedges on the daily right now which is the most I have ever seen and they all give us potential to reject a resistance tomorrow. 

The black dotted support line using August 3rd, Aug 2nd, July 27th and July 26th we have 413.8 as support tomorrow. 

We broke the possible down trend resistance today too. 

We are also about to hit the 417.4 level support which is also the daily 200ema. 

Overall despite pretty much every sign pointing to a sell off today AND that morning dump looking hella convincing the bears continue to be in control. There is no reason to short this until we break the 100ema. But I still hesitate to go long until we see the daily 200ema confirmed broken.

If we break that 200ema there is a decent chance we reach out for 430 next week. A good CPI could fuel an even higher bull run too. 

https://preview.redd.it/lv324lxl8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863757c0e7963f322dc6c7a70d5bb2ceb9001593

Futures major resistances are the blacked dotted rising wedge at 4178, red dotted resistance at 4202 and the blue bull channel at 4241.

The 4178 level is both the daily 200ema and it is the resistance from June highs. 

The biggest supports to watch for ES is 4117 and 4079 tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/z44f7ggm8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2020a20b334ba1b0e2d880768f85da8ff568465a

Spy on the weekly timeframe did attempt to break into the next weekly level at 415 today, however, end of day it lost that level. This has been a level that has been struggled to be breached and closed over since April. This will be a key level to watch the bulls and bears fight over.

Futures also rejecting this level of 4160 too. This level for futures too has been pretty major resistance since April. 

The bears will need to defend these 415/ 4160 level aggressively tomorrow if they have any hopes for the EOW and next week. Overall this is setting up for a break out to that 430/ 4360 levels unless we see a major sell off tomorrow and Friday.

I didn‚Äôt manage my risk well enough and from there it was pretty much over. And then they faked me out with the head and shoulders on the 15min and break of momentum only to rip it even higher. 

Todays lesson‚Ä¶ stick to your rules AND never ever fight momentum. The momentum today especially on the volumes was some of the stupidest extreme bull momentum ive seen yet. 

Tomorrows a new day and a new chance. 

I am carrying some 9dte Apple 152.5 puts overnight that I do suspect by next week to at minimum break even. If we ever lose this bull momentum and we drop to gap fill as I suspect Apple needs to then they will be sitting pretty good.",8-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TA,1.0,2022-08-03 20:43:43

Because of this China debacle and Apes being blamed, it makes me dig harder. Most of you probably know the info already but I feel better getting it off of my chest. Like I said, there is not a wrinkle on my brain and I am by no means a financial advisor. 

Loop Capital Markets seem to be in on the shenanigans and distractions that have caused me more angst than it should. We know that any financial firm and HF‚Äôs names that end in Markets, Advisors, Holdings or Group are probably gonna be bad news for retail and individual traders like us.

In comes Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, commonly known as Deloitte. One of the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù firms in the world, of which they‚Äôre all linked too! Surprise!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte

Deloitte has had a presence in China since 1917. Let me sum up some of their recent history though. 

In 2005, Deloitte acquired Beijing Pan-China CPA to become the largest accountancy firm in China. Just prior to this acquisition Deloitte China had about 3,200 employees. This acquisition was part of a five-year plan to invest $150 million in China.

In 2007, Deloitte began hiring former employees of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for their competitive intelligence unit known as Deloitte Intelligence. 

In 2009, Deloitte purchased the North American public service practice of BearingPoint (KPMG Consulting) for $350 million after it filed for bankruptcy protection.

Deloitte LLP took over the UK property consultants Drivers Jonas in January 2010. AKA, Deloitte Real Estate.

In 2011, Deloitte acquired DOMANI Sustainability Consulting and ClearCarbon Consulting in order to expand its sustainability service offerings

In January 2012, Deloitte announced the acquisition of √úbermind, a mobile advertising agency. The acquisition marked Deloitte's first entrance into the mobile application field.

In November 2012, Deloitte acquired Recombinant Data Corporation, a company specializing in data warehousing and clinical intelligence software.

On 11 January 2013, Deloitte acquired substantially all of the business of Monitor Group.

In 2016, Deloitte acquired advertising agency Heat of San Francisco, best known for its work Madden NFL from EA Sports and the Hotwire travel website. Becoming one of world's largest digital agencies.

In September 2016, Apple Inc. announced a partnership with Deloitte aimed at boosting sales of its phones and other mobile devices to businesses. As part of the partnership, the two companies will launch a service called Enterprise Next, in which more than 5,000 Deloitte consultants will advise clients on how to make better use of Apple products and services.

In October 2016, Deloitte announced that they were creating Deloitte North West Europe. The Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish member firms will combine with the UK and Swiss member firms to create Deloitte North West Europe. Deloitte, over the next three years, would invest ‚Ç¨200m to enhance its services to its global, national and private market clients and to create development opportunities. The firm came into effect on 1 June 2017 and it is estimated to have 28,000 partners and people generating over ‚Ç¨5bn in annual revenue. Deloitte North West Europe accounts for approximately 20% of all revenue within their Global Network.[43]

In March 2022, Deloitte acquired Etain, a data and digital transformation specialist company, based in Northern Ireland.

TL;DR: These dickbites own all of us! Deloitte manipulate the world. The only place that they say they don‚Äôt work is Russia and Belarus. If you believe that, I have some beachfront property on Uranus to sell you.

&gt;AAPL investors need to see inside the company‚Äôs ‚Äú$70 billion black box,‚Äù say analysts ‚Äì a reference to Apple lumping together all its Services revenue into one figure, despite the fact that it effectively covers ten different businesses with the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple used to be relatively open about its sources of income, including reporting individual sales figures for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
That changed in 2018, when the company announced that it would cease to report sales numbers, and would instead reveal only the revenue stream for each product line. Given the range of retail prices for different models, that made it much harder to get a sense of how well particular product lines were selling.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Apple reporting Services income as a single figure didn‚Äôt used to be much of an issue back in the days when we knew it was the App Store plus much smaller miscellaneous income for other things.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
But things are very different today. Services is a huge element of the company‚Äôs earnings. The business is worth way more than Mac and iPad put together, and it‚Äôs getting close to the combined totals of Mac + iPad + AirPods + Apple Watch. Heck, as of the most recent numbers it‚Äôs almost half as big as iPhone revenue!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;iPhone: $40.67 billion  
Mac: $7.38 billion  
iPad: $7.22 billion  
Wearables: $8.08 billion  
Services: $19.60 billion

Service is also the only part of Apple‚Äôs business where revenue (almost) only moves in one direction ‚Äì up.","AAPL investors need to see inside the company‚Äôs ‚Äú$70 billion black box,‚Äù",1.0,2022-08-03 14:03:52

Heres what im seeing on the daily chart for SPY and ES Futures. 

On SPY and ES futures you can see for the now third day in a row we have failed to breakout and test that level resistance at SPY 417.3/ ES 4178. This level also corresponds to the daily 200 EMA. This level is key resistance as back in late may/ early June this is the level where we rejected, consolidated and then dumped prior to Junes CPI. Why do I mention CPI here‚Ä¶ well next Wednesday August 10th is when July CPI is released and it looks like we are setting up for the perfect consolidation and then early week (august 8th/ 9th) dump before CPI. 

Overall the bulls were able to defend the daily 100ema again and hold key support for SPY 407.3/ ES 4090.

I mentioned yesterday that the SPY daily candle looked more bearish than then ES daily candle but now we are seeing both looking bearish into close today especially SPY.

Overall we are now trading for 3 straight days between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema. Until we see one of those levels break we should not full commit to going long calls or puts. Overall I am leaning more bearish then bullish going into tomorrow. 

Bull case- Despite a failure to break yesterdays HOD, bulls were able to defend the 100ema and prevent a closing below that. Now that the Taiwan stuff is mostly settled (until something new happens) there isn‚Äôt much market moving news till CPI next week. On the weekly bulls were also able to hold the weekly 20ema which still sits over the weekly 100ema. For the last 3 days now intraday 407.2 to 409.1 has been extremely strong support and a massive consolidation zone. With another 407.2 (daily 100ema) bounce tomorrow bulls will look to retake the Monday HOD and close over SPY 412/ ES 4133.

Bear case- overall after a pretty strong and extreme momentum run up last week we are finally seeing some of that momentum subside and seeing weakness. Today bulls failed to break the previous HOD and are now actually building a 123 top which should lead to further downside. The current pattern is looking similar to the July 21st,22nd and 25th trading days. If that pattern holds true we are looking for a bull channel support test of SPY 404/ ES 4056 tomorrow. If bears can break this support then the next step is for them to close under the 100ema, close under level support and attempt to breakthrough/ close under 8 week long bull channel support. In doing so I believe we are going to start our next level down to 390 √† 370 to gap fill. Yesterday I mentioned the daily candle finished in a gravestone doji, however, today also finished in a gravestone doji. I have not often seen double gravestone dojis. However, gravestone dojis generally mean that we are about to see a pretty impressive down side and that the ‚Äútop‚Äù is in. I do expect this to play out tomorrow. 

Tomorrow plan will be to keep an eye on that 404 level‚Ä¶ if we break 404 then its time to load some puts‚Ä¶ if bulls defend 404 or especially defend that 407.2 daily 100ema again we may form a double bottom and push higher before CPI is released next week. Overall with todays close and these daily candles I favor downside.

Overall the Apple daily chat is the most bearish of them all.  Today apple closed with its third doji in a row.. two of which have been gravestone dojis. Todays candle close is probable one of the more bearish candle closes that we have seen on Apple in a while. I mentioned before apple pretty much drives this market right now and I believe we are about to see it drive us lower. 

If you look at the weekly chart you can see when we compare last week and this weeks candles to the March 21/ March 28th weekly candles (the last big run up) we are looking oddly similar‚Ä¶ I think we are putting the current top in and if not this week next week for sure we are going to see some good downside. 

The most bullish thing for apple is that the bulls were able to hold 159.55 support pretty stoutly today. I am impressed with even the eod sell off today that they were able to. 

Key support to watch tomorrow is 159.55 tomorrow, if bulls can defend that tomorrow we might retest 163.3 channel resistance once more before we start the descent. However, if bears can break through this support level they are going to target that gap fill at 157.64, which just so happens to correspond perfectly with the daily 8ema. If bulls can allow the gap fill and defend the 8ema at the same time there is a chance this could be the support bounce/ bull channel support test before we push even higher. However, once the bulls lose the 8ema I believe we are going to see a test lower closer to 147 to 151 before we bounce.

A little interesting fact about Apple is that it almost always fills the gap (atleast in 2022) after 3 days. So being that this gap did not fill today (day 3) there is a better chance that we could fill the gap next week. If we are going off statistics then we should actually suspect a bounce tomorrow off 159.55 and then next week we will look for the sell off.

Now that we have brought up CPI I think its time we have a little discussion about that‚Ä¶ I am going to make a bigger post here in the future on CPI but the last four CPIs are have actually have seen the last four CPIs see similar sell offs. Overall the last four CPIs the two days that lead to CPI have seen an average drop of 2.6% over those two days. There is a pretty big case building here that we are going to see consolidation between the 100ema and 200ema or at least that 405 to 417 level the rest of the week and Monday and Tuesday next week leading to CPI is going to be hella bloody. 

[v](https://preview.redd.it/c3pyvmvn7df91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baf252ee9e16f2572a0fe9d316af7f9c5d86ac42)

I will speak on this more in my dedicated CPI post but overall the feds are predicting a drop in inflation‚Ä¶ however the Cleveland fed who is usually about 0.3% low is predicting a 8.8% inflation or really a 9.1% inflation rate again‚Ä¶ There are a few fed members coming out too saying inflation has peaked. 

Overall my thoughts on this week remain at consolidation before the next leg down. There is a case to be made that if the 405 level is broken this week we start the party a little early though. 

10% challenge-

Today was a great day for me. 

I was waiting for the morning to settle out as I knew there was a lot of uncertainty with Pelosi. I shoulda rode those calls up as soon as I saw her land but I did not expect that big of a face ripper at all. By time things looked solid enough to get into we were so far over the probable high of day and close to the improbable high of day I didn‚Äôt wanna enter but for a scalp. 

https://preview.redd.it/a7e5zbio7df91.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=021da5bb0a3cbbbcd7892aa7af8a12f78633ac44

I played the 1245pm top perfectly but unfortunately I did not expect it to be that big of a face melter at all‚Ä¶ exited with my stop limit around 4.7% and about a minute later the bottom literally fell out. 

That 0dte SPX call was the weirdest one of the day as I had a 5% stop limit set, however, when it triggered it filled closer to 1.4%. IT was a limit not a market so im still unsure on that whole thing. 

Overall im sure some of you agree and noticed but option premiums were funky. I noticed many times on pretty significant moves up and down that the premiums were hardly moving at all. There were other times were it just seemed laggy. I had someone in the server say that the premiums were so laggy and weird that he opened a position with an OCO take profit and it hit as soon as he opened the order. It was very weird. I noticed some of that yesterday too where premiums just didn‚Äôt hit right. 

Overall todays lesson was I shoulda better utilized SPX 0dtes instead of the 1dte SPY. I would have better increased my % gains. 

I also am still learning the 1min HA candles and overall I have really enjoyed them so far. I noticed a couple places of bounces and break downs today that I did not act on but watched play out as expected. As the week goes on I look forward to testing these more. Overall the 1min seems great for scalps and the 5min overall really helps with sentiment/ direction. 

I know a lot of people struggle with the ""i closed at 5% but man it ran to 100% right after."" The things i have learned in trading is the times you close for 5% profit it runs to 100%... the times you refuse to close at 5% profit is the time it goes red... someone posted this chart the other day and its pretty eye opening...

Looking at the SPY/ ES daily charts we got a couple important things to note. 

On SPY the daily candle did wick through the downward bear channel resistance, however, on ES we had a clear rejection of resistance. Channel resistance for ES remains at 4142 for tomorrow. 

Despite a weaker day and closing red the bulls were able to hold the 100ema and even avoided a true retest of that support. SPYs daily candle finished as a large bodied gravestone doji while you could consider ES futures daily either a dragonfly doji or a hanging man depending on how you analyze it. 

SPY daily candle is bearish while ES is neutral to bullish, however, with the ES channel resistance rejection I favor bearish there. 

As you can see on SPY I have highlighted some horizontal levels that we have historically this year traded within. Currently we are visiting that 405.3 to 417.2 levels. If you look at May 27th to June 8th it appears we could be preparing to enter a similar level of consolidation. This consolidation could lead to the next leg down or up with 405 and 417 being those key levels to watch for direction. 

The 417 level is going to be protected heavily by the daily 200ema and that will be quite the resistance for bulls to break and hold over, while by time we get to it the daily 8ema will be closer to that 405 level and also will add some downside support/ protection and the daily 100ema at 407.5 should provide some heavier support also. 

Overall daily chart wise I will be watching for range/ consolidation and prepared to play the level to level chop like I did today. Until we see the daily 100ema or daily 200ema break I am not apt to chose an overall direction. 

https://preview.redd.it/twterangw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9786a3823c46ab0759908677e68f0a09ede7016

SPY/ ES weekly you can see we did break out of the bear channel, however, historically about the time w break the channel is about the time we are seeing the top and start our week of consolidation. So that is something to bear in mind. Overall the SPY 415 and ES 4160 levels are going to be very key resistance levels to watch this week. If we see a pretty clean rejection there going into next week (much like the week of May 31st and June 6th) I will be apt to play some downside going into next week. 

Bulls need to defend the now 8 week long bull channel support at SPY 400 and ES 4018. Overall this support is also the weekly 8emas for both. An intraweek support bounce here and pushing further up before end of the week would be bullish going into next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/1x97im2iw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23aca5365443d9fac728e1f719253ec938d65206

Overall Apple is the most bearish of them all and as I alerted today at the 163.59 HOD rejection that Apple is the best put play between SPY and Apple. That rejection today locked in my opinion an extremely bearish week ahead for Apple. 

https://preview.redd.it/93yf23niw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b006f87c503fad3a288e27ffe30ead4b52d775

Todays daily candle is a double top and it is also a large gravestone doji. This candle should be the reversal/ downside indication many need to go long on some puts for the gap fill. As I mentioned last week apple had one of the largest gaps in many years left of the daily. I was also mentioning the weekly and how it was looking for a weekly channel rejection‚Ä¶ well today we got that confirmed rejection. 

I will be looking for apple to back test support and gap fill this week. 

Key supports will be the weekly bull channel support/ daily 8ema at 157. And the gap just so happens to be at 157.64‚Ä¶ almost too perfect of a bounce area. Level and daily channel support comes in around that 157 level also. I would be surprised to not see some 8/5 or 8/12 ATM puts print nicely on this gap fill. 

Once the apple gap fills I do suspect there to be a nice bounce unless it flies through 157 and see 155 level. A break of the 155 level would be a bear omen and could lead to the next market sell off.

In my opinion this whole year apple has led and predicted the direction of where SPY and the markets were going.

10% challenge-

I had an extremely frustrating week last week and spent a lot of the weekend reflecting and back testing a few different strategies to improve my trading. This week I decided to make a few adjustments to my trading and indicators and here they are.

\- i am now watching the 1min/ 5min chart with heikin ashi candles with a 20/ 50 ema following it. Intraday today the 1min HA candles with the 20/50ema was the best and most responsive. The 5min with the 20/50ema was great but a very lagging indicator. 

\- i am no longer tracking the VIX live for entries. I used to heavily track the VIX and momentum there to confirm the direction of SPY. With the low VIX and overall detachedness of VIX/ SPY I no longer feel the need to do so. 

\-I have no added my daily and weekly levels to my 15min chart I watch all day (level highlighted with purple and red thick lines). I think often times I was getting too lost in the noise of the the 15min candles, especially on days like today, and mixing the bigger picture level to level moves. Overall this was highly successful. 

\-focusing on limiting entries for better profits on less entries. Less is more. 

\-cutting all losers hard stop at 20%. No more letting losers become massive losers. 

\-Relying on the probable and improbable IV levels as a better guide of when to and note to enter. The higher and closer to the improbable HOD the less likely hood I am to enter unless we have hella strong momentum and volume.

675,1659368552,wdkkpw,1," New highs in the stock market could arrive a lot sooner than investors expect, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.

He said the S&amp;P 500 could hit new highs before year-end as the 2022 bear market is over.

""When bad news doesn't take down markets, it is time for investors to assess,"" Lee said.

The stock market could be gearing up for new record highs before year-end as the 2022 bear market is over, Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a note on Friday.

""The biggest takeaway for me on events of this week? Convincing and arguably decisive evidence the 'bottom is in' ‚Äî the 2022 bear market is over,"" he said.

Lee's confidence stems from the fact that between a negative GDP print, another 75-basis-point interest rate hike from the Fed, and more natural gas volatility due to Russia's Nord Stream pipeline drama, a lot of bad news occurred this week and yet the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 managed to stage a 3% rally.

""When bad news doesn't take down markets, it is time for investors to assess,"" Lee said.

On the earnings front, despite a strong US dollar and heightened economic uncertainty, companies are reporting better-than-feared results. With 52% of the S&amp;P 500 having reported second-quarter earnings already, 73% beat profit estimates by a median 7%.

Earnings matter because in the long term that's what drives stock prices.

Results from mega-cap tech behemoths Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all eased investor concerns about the resilience of their growth and their ability to manage inflation, which helped drive considerable gains in their stock prices this week.

Lee believes the economy has reached the pivot point where incoming data will be decisively less negative, and disinflation tailwinds are set to strengthen. Commodities from metals to oil to grains have been on the decline in recent weeks, which has already resulted in some price declines for consumers.

Then when I did I mean seconds later it would reverse on me. I have never in my life had so many positions in one day or one week that I bought and it immediately went red on me. 

I did some heavy analysis of my 2022 trading year though and I have come up with a few changes I plan to make going forward. 

https://preview.redd.it/be4u0zrv0le91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9b1527af3a8547730dbb6eda5251d2614216675

Heres where I fucked up today and have reflected on it most of the day to see where I went wrong. I expected the gap to be filled which we did this morning. However, I expected a push upward first and then we would fill the gap between 10 and 11. However, we immediately filled it and at the time it did look like we were just going to trend all day with that 413 target. I bought in at the first arrow on some calls. 

That candle historically speaking and I can find countless examples to support it is a continuation candle. However, we crashed like a hot mess we are. I have been burning myself and my account with holding losers too long so I wanted to cut them early today. I sold around that 11am candle when we closed below the 8ema. And jumped in puts waiting for 407.2 retest. Of course it then pretty much immediately reverse on me. From there it was pretty likely that we were going to go back to 413.  

I bought calls once we broke through the 409.6 resistance expecting at least a 410.7 touch‚Ä¶ and this is where I royally fucked up. I was attempting to replace my limit sell so I could visualize on TOS where SPY needed to end up. However, I fucked up and accidentally had it unlocked not lucked on the limit price and it sold it for -10%..... immediately after it was up 30% within 5 minutes. 

Today and really this week is one of those days where nothing goes your way. 

I did do some deep dive analysis of my trading and I will speak on that at the end.

So this is where things get VERY interesting for SPY and Es futures daily charts‚Ä¶

SPY is above and ES futures below‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/fz1qlw8y0le91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd7e6985dbc9a45cbf2ca35e6efc63be78e226ed

So when we look at ES and SPY the daily charts are nearly identical‚Ä¶ lets look at the bull and bear cases

Bull- This is the first candle closed over the daily 100ema since April 5th, the daily 8ema has now crossed the 50ema for the first time since beginning of April and the 20ema is closing in on the 50ema, We have been holding the same bull channel since July 13th now. We pretty much have no negative catalysts until CPI on august 10th. 

Bear case- we have been in the same bull channel for 2 weeks now and historically this year that Is about as long as bear market rallies last, we attempted to breakout and hard rejected 413 orange channel resistance. The last time the candles broke over the 100ema we were near the top in April and slowly after we led to the descent downward. The bull momentum is slowing as things go on and the bulls highly struggled this morning. 

Bull supports to hold- 409.5/ 4090 √† 401.8/4022 (bull channel support) √† 391/3918 √† 378.8/ 3805 (gap fill)

Bear resistance to hold- 413/4145 √† 415/ 4180 √† 433/ 4348 (overall 2022 bear market resistance line)

Overall the way I see it we are at a decision point here‚Ä¶ we either open Monday green and we are going to see 430 before we see any more downside OR we are going to open hella red Monday and hold under 413 the rest of the week which will lead to the 378.5 gap fill. 

https://preview.redd.it/xv43igmz0le91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d74addc137f914e5c86da2b97e6058c820a84d

Looking at the SPY/ ES weeklies they are damn near identical too. A few things to note here is that today we just re-established the resistance of this overall WEEKLY downward channel. Now its noted that we have NOT retested the overall bear market resistance line which is 4370/ 435 for next week. 

This is now the 2nd green week in a row we have only had one three green weeks in a row since 2022 has started. It will be quite interesting to see if the bulls can continue this run next week. 

Overall its hard to deny looking at the chart and just overall living and breathing it That since the week of June 13th the bulls have been in control. The question is can then continue the momentum or not? 

https://preview.redd.it/8wcdlro01le91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74a38014364da7d7e9b8f4d020076bd1bfbf238a

This apple chart is hella interesting. So this is currently what I have with yesterdays trend lines. As you can see there has been a lot of resistance broken‚Ä¶ so let me edit this and update the downward channel. 

https://preview.redd.it/ybnejqc11le91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0359c3beb9214eba85074df5d87168025c52e7a

Now the interesting thing about this Apple chart is that if we look at the October low and June low as support they make a PERFECT channel using January and March highs for resistance. 

Now apple today as you can see MASSIVELY gapped up thanks to earnings. This is actually the largest gap at $1.86 since the October 9th to October 12th $2.28 gap. In the last two years there has not been a gap left unfilled on Apple. So this is definitely something to keep in mind. 

Now the chart shows that we actually have some upside potential as high as 175 by middle of August if this momentum keeps up. However, if we finally see the momentum slow we may actually break down as low as 150 before we hit major support. 

https://preview.redd.it/dgv4hyg21le91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73790966b597fb9cd0473a613516936ab2f07e57

Apples weekly chart does show a slightly different story then the daily. IT shows that one this current bull channel is absolutely asinine in how strong it is. In 6 weeks Apple has gone from 129.04 to 163.63 for a wild bear market? Rally of 26%+. This makes the March rally look like a rally for ants. 

However using the weekly support bounces in May and June with resistance from April you can see we have actually not quite hit resistance just yet. However if bears can hold 163.6 as resistance Monday and through the rest of the week we just may be putting the top of this bear market rally in.

Why do I care about apple? Why is its chart so important? Apple has both led the March rallies and the current rallies it also led the April sell off. Where Apple goes we go. 

Major levels to watch are 163.5 √† 175 and 165 √† 145. Which ever one of those levels break we should expect the next big move.  

Analysis of my 2022 Trading History-

So this week just has been frustrating after having a pretty solid end of June and July. I wanted to deep dive into what DTE has been the best for me and which DTE works for me and my strategy. The results actually were kinda shocking and interesting so id like to deep dive into that for you guys. 

https://preview.redd.it/q6zdt4a31le91.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=539d6711c42a9a01c8d980c0fbd66854b5ebbc62

Okay so here we have my breakdown of all my 2022 trades. Note- I don‚Äôt have some data from January. Okay so let me break this down for everyone and what it means and what the numbers mean. 

\*if you read nothing read the last part about the -20% losses or more\*

\-In the first top left square you have every day broken down and anaylzed. What this was analyzed for was to see if at a certain mount of trades per day my win rate was better or worse. Overall 1-9 trades per day was negligibly the same. However, there was a slight increase in overall win rate when I took 10+ trades a day. In the days I took these higher amounts of trades many of them were very quick in and out trades of 5-15% gains. So this does show in my opinion quick scalps are better for me. 

\-Next I wanted to break down if 0-1, 2-5, or 6+ DTE were more successful for me. Overall 0-1 DTE actually had a much higher win rate then 2-5DTE did. My highest win rate came from 6+ DTE though. To note most of my 6+ DTE trades are either swings or longer term holds and you can see that I have only took 44 of those trades all year so far. 

Breaking it down further you see that profits per trade my most profitable is actually the 6+ DTE but overall I have made the most TOTAL profits from 2-5DTEs even though ive taken about half the amount of 2-5dte trades as I have 0-1 dte trades. 

This is where things are a big perplexing for me. Overall I have a higher profits/ trade and total profits using 2-5dte but my win rate is actually higher with 0-1 dte. This could be a case of less is more here for sure. 

Bottom right you can see my YTD win rate % is sitting at 69.46% and YTD P/L total is as you see. Also note about for the profits/ trade and total profits per DTE that figure factors in both losses AND wins. This is not just factoring in winners. 

\-So this one right here hurst the most. The box of ‚Äúlosses -20% or more‚Äù for $64,305‚Ä¶ this one hurt the most to analyze and factor in. But it also is the MOST IMPORTANT one of all the data I analyzed. So what exactly is this number showing. So this is the figure of EXTRA money I loss pretty much for no reason. This money is money I lost strictly from letting my losers become bigger losers and failing to take an L early. Many trades have a pretty hard stop loss set at -20% and don‚Äôt waver from it. Its something I have highly considered but haven‚Äôt yet done myself. 

To further explain easier what this number means essentially what I did was take all of my losers and the amount I actually lost. So lets say I had a -80% position and lost lets say -$800 (for easy math)‚Ä¶. Had I closed that loser at -20% the loser would only be -$200. So I had an excess loss of -$600. -$800 subtracting the -$200 (had I taken the L at -20%). 

So this number above shows that had I just taken the -20% loss I would have SAVED myself about $64k in pretty much unnecessary losses this year. Add the YTD P/L plus these losses over -20% and yeah that number is quite staggering if you ask me‚Ä¶ Essentially I let just as many losers run WAY too far then I took profits this year. That‚Äôs essentially $64k that I should still have to trade on but is gone forever. 

So going forward whats going to change? Well if I want to do 0-1dte the win rate shows that is not a bad idea at all and overall win rate % wise its warranted. However, I need to cap all losers at -20% hard stop no waiting no deviating. 

So what does this look like. Let me give you an example.

Lets say you have a 20k account. So you play 2k per trade‚Ä¶ If you were to do $2000 on a trade and then you took a loss at 20%. You only lose $400. So tomorrow (remember cash only accounts settle over night) you then have $19,600 to trade with tomorrow. If you cap your loser at -20% yeah you might lose $400 today‚Ä¶ but I would rather lose $400 today and have $1600 to trade with tomorrow then loser 50% or $1000 and only have $1000 to trade with the next day‚Ä¶

Options is a long game. Its all about take profits quickly and living to trade another day. 

Have a great weekend guys I will see you guys Monday! Looking forward to a full week back in the saddle.",7-29-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Weekly Analysis and recap,1.0,2022-07-29 22:18:50

Okay so I have a few things to say about where we are at right now and where we are going and how to play these future days. I hope I am correct and I hope that we all make a lot of money.

Okay first off I want you to take a look at the March FOMC meetings data and todays FOMC data‚Ä¶ kinda interesting if you ask me. We had similar days yesterday and today was identical. Now lets take a look at the Daily chart and see some interesting correlations‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/gt9ppd23jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27acf0fd4e865d23478b92dedbafa0bb7fc35cd0

Okay take a look back at march I have highlighted with a blue arrow and a ‚Äúthe day before march FOMC meeting.‚Äù If you look at it there is clearly a trend there where we bottomed the day before fomc and from there if you look at the candles they are nearly identical. So what does that mean? Well it means to me we are about to go on a even bigger bull run then we are currently on. Okay hear me out here for a second‚Ä¶

In March we had a meeting and then we had no more meetings until May‚Ä¶ we are currently in July and have no meeting until September. We are looking at a nearly identical trajectory and base as then. If you remember back to march it was the simple buy calls on the morning dips and let it eat. This morning I was very tempted to get into some 30dte calls and the only reason I did not get into those calls were because I knew Apple earnings were tonight and PCE was tomorrow morning. 

We are in a clear bull path towards 420-430. 

Here is a few other things to look at and think about. If you look at the purpleish blue trend line I highlighted the May 20th to June 2nd bear market rally. That rally was about 9.69% and lasted 8 days from low to peak. I superimposed that over to current July 14th bottom. Which shows that we are now tapped out on the bullrun is that‚Äôs the trajectory we are going off. Currently from the July 14th bottom we are up 9.6%. The argument could be made that we just made the top today and it is downward from here. 

Now if we are basing it off the day before FOMC meeting being the bottom like March then we look at the March 14th to March 29th 11 day rally of 11.1%. Which give us an 11 day trajectory (August 10th‚Ä¶ the day of the next CPI meeting‚Ä¶.) and a 11.1% rally which give us about 432.8 price target. 

Now this is where it gets crazy‚Ä¶. I calculated that trajectory strictly based off of the data not the chart. Now if you go to the chart and you look at August 10th AND look at the resistance line (the solid green line) it PERFECTLY correlated at‚Ä¶. 433.33‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/tidgke35jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e442e5dc7c303b8f19e29dc7232fdb596c80c36

So am I bullish? Hell yeah. Apple looking great after its earnings‚Ä¶ why does that matter? Well let me show you why‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/gxrfhjm5jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a5208488935ad14684486cd108fb5cb64f11458

Here is the Apple chart‚Ä¶ what do you see? You can see we are in a CLEAR downward grey channel that we have been trading within for all of 2022. This channel uses the lows from January and May then projects that to the highest point of march. IF apple opens over 157.2 tomorrow morning (which with earnings it should) then we are about to see Apple confirm 100% that its bear market is over‚Ä¶ This would be the first time in 2022 that Apple fails to make lower highs over and over. Yes we have not broke the actual March high but breaking this channel is essentially saying the 2022 Apple bear market is now over‚Ä¶ With this move Apple is going to Guide SPY and the rest of the market higher and higher. 

Apples next price target assuming it holds and breaks over 157.2 at open will be 163.9 -&gt; 174 -&gt; 180.

The one thing to be careful about with Apple is if it opens up with a massive gap tomorrow whether that fills or not. 

https://preview.redd.it/tphgasq6jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c2954f225490cd2f28c76eb06fc50da07312c49

Here is the SPY and ES weekly charts that show just how bullish we are‚Ä¶ Tomororw bulls are going to look to close the week out over 4145/ 413. Breaking those weekly downward channels opens us up to those green dotted resistance lines with a price target of 430/ 4335 by the week of CPI. 

If you look at the green dotted resistance and blue dotted support lines they are actually forming a massive symmetrical triangle which should lead to a fairly significant breakout or break down. 

Overall with not really anything negative besides PCE tomorrow‚Ä¶ which im only even mentioning this since JPOW was so clear in his ‚Äúwe look at PCE more then CPI‚Äù during his speech. But after tomorrow morning when market opens and we see it settle I will be entering some either 14dte calls. I will be looking at some 14dte 414C according to optionstrat that will be about the best risk to reward for my price target of 433 and time frame. 

Looking at after hours right now we are up about 0.83% which will leave another nearly $3 gap on the daily down below. This would be the third on the daily chart to the downside now‚Ä¶ does that confirm we see more downside in the future? Yes I think it does‚Ä¶ one small gap I can justify leaving but I cant really justify leaving three pretty decently sized gaps on the daily chart. 

Most likely scenario is we get somewhere near that 433 price target before we reject and see further downside. 410-415 will be a crucial resistance to watch on the way up. 

Lately it appears at least for the last two weeks that we get a fake breakout in the morning followed by a sell off and then around 10 to 11 we finally find bottom and that is the optimal buy and hold call opportunity. I will be looking for this to play out tomorrow as I do suspect we could back fill the gap down to 406.8 in the morning at open before we push higher. 

It wouldn‚Äôt be unheard of to see markets open and straight rally in a trend day now that all earnings are down, gdp is apparently old news already, no fed meetings for 8 weeks and no cpi for 3 weeks. There is literally nothing to worry about now‚Ä¶

All dips are now call buying opportunities‚Ä¶

10% challenge-

A pretty meh day for me today. 

https://preview.redd.it/12t0x5b8jde91.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23b4d6a992ad71fc3d6b2cfaa0e88047dcae5e93

I held those SPX puts overnight expecting a pretty big dump on GDP. Thankfully was able to get out of them at the bottom this morning. Apple looked hella weak this morning and with the earnings I attempted to enter for a nice free IV pump but apparently I bought the bottom.   
 I had the perfect SPX scalp around noon when there was a big dump in volume. Was up 10% instantly. Had a stop limit order in and it didn‚Äôt fill on the way down. Never saw green again. 404 was the probable high of day and it was not quite convincing at the time we would go much higher. At least we did though and I finally took my loss. Play a SPY 1dte call on the way up. 

So far since I was on vacation earlier in the week and didn‚Äôt trade FOMC im sitting on a slightly red but manageable week right now. 

Not riding anything overnight. I was pretty close to entering those 14 or 30dte calls at market close but decided it was best to wait for apple and PCE just in case.",7-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TA,1.0,2022-07-28 21:06:15

**Hello Everyone,**

**Respected Traders and Investors** 

Long time no see. As you all know, I have been kicked out of my mom‚Äôs house. But I never told you guys the reason why. The thing that I'm about to tell you is kinda shocking and a secret. So promise me that you won't tell anybody. I'm counting on you guys that this stays b/w us.

&amp;#x200B;

As you all know I'm kinda a massive bear in the stock market thinking the world is about to go into a forgotten depression ( if not Great Depression. 95 yr of cycle ) which would be written in some book about after we complete this fourth turning. Whether its ""Stagflationary"" or ""Deflationary"" one remains the case to be seen. But currently the market is projecting it to be deflationary one. So I don't wanna hear any complaints from any of you that you weren't able to buy long term bonds with hedge funds last month. No complaints. Period. I gave you the date and you just had to buy it b//w May 15-June 15. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So moving forward. Since i‚Äôm so bearish i wanted to go meet somebody who is just the polar opposite of me being pessimist bear. The man had to be someone who had been investing in the high inflation kind of environment and who outperformed the market when the market rebounded sharply from being a bear market to bull market. Yes my friends i built a time machine in my mom's basement. xD

&amp;#x200B;

This type of scenario happened in 1920-21, 1948-50, 1975-1976. Since my machine cannot go so far into the past because it would consume a lot of electricity and power. I just don't wanna pay high energy prices. I am also quite worried about a global energy crisis so I thought why not cut my trip short and meet anyone from 1970's stagflation. The second half of the 70's decade when the market began to turn. I wanted to meet someone who beat the market during this time. This man is someone you must have read stories about from your ancestors, associates or probably in the books. This man is none another than ‚ÄúPeter Lynch‚Äù His fund Magellan outperformed the market during the second half period of stagflation when market rebounded. The other guy who was a close second during this time was Warren Buffet but he is still alive and we can track his investments if we ever wanna know how to invest in a bear market. ‚ÄúJust buy Oil stocks'' he says‚Äù But if you do your own research you would know he was the winner in the first half of the 70's decade. So in general he was good too. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So i was building this time machine that will let me travel in the past to meet my man Peter Lynch. Once the machine worked successfully I wasted no time jumping right in and reached the period after the turmoil had long been over somewhere b/w 1991-92. It was a cold rainy night. He just came back to his home after working late hours in the office. At first i hesitated thinking what his reaction would be but then i thought f%#k it. Let‚Äôs just ring the doorbell. Then came the footsteps approaching and there he was the man himself, whom I admire the most. I just don‚Äôt know why I was shaking a lot. So as he came by i immediately greeted him at first and said ‚ÄúHello sir‚Äù. I have come from the future of 2022 and I wanted some help regarding the investing world. The man didn't even flinch and said ‚ÄúHuh, Okay‚Äù. It was like he knew that one day people from the future would invent a time machine or he just thinks that maybe i'm the guy from the work who has lost his minds spending hours finding the stocks. So then he said sure I will give you my two hrs to help you get educated about the principles of stock market w/o taking your millions of dollars. I was so happy and excited that now I will be able to beat the market and make a name for myself in ""Wall street"". As I was going through the house I realized that there was no one in the house which kinda felt strange at first but then later when we sat down it all felt comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

So here‚Äôs the conversation that took place b/w me a reddit noob of ""Wallstreetbets"" and the man who beat the market in the later half of the 70's decade when the market rebounded.

( Me = Wall street Noob , Peter = The great ‚ÄúPeter Lynch‚Äù )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir, do you know it's pleasure to meet you in person. I‚Äôm a huge fan of you and so are the many of the investors in Wall street corporate america.

**Peter :** Well thank you. Glad to hear but hey please don't tell me about the future as it could mess with the timelines. Haha.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sure. Do you know what sir? We have a community which is kinda like the community in the physical realm where we take down large corporations by making bets. Kinda like David vs goliath.

**Peter :** Oh really that sounds cool. It looks like people in the future are really not afraid of investing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Well sir right now everyone is. We all are realizing that it is a hard game. Not for everyone. The only thing we guys do is post our losses on reddit and brag about it.

**Peter :** What so fun bragging about your losses. Don't you guys wanna make money?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Well sir it's complicated. You wouldn't understand,

**Peter :** Do you even know who i am?

 

**Me :**  Sorry sir. I didn't mean it that way.

**Peter :** \*\* Uff what a loser. Okay. Shall we start?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Silently  Yes.

**Peter :** Lemme ask you a simple question. What kind of stock do you own? And the reason why?

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Well sir i used to own these what i called Voldemort asset class kind of stocks because they went up so much. I think they will go up again in 2024-25 due to the halving cycle associated with them. This type of stocks would have place in the so called ""Metaverse"" which would be a place in digital world. What about you sir. What kind of stocks do you own?

**Peter :** Well I own this company. They make a relatively mundane product. It‚Äôs a one megabit, S-ram, Cmos, Bipolar risk, Floating point data I/o array processor with optimizing compiler, 16-bit dual port memory with Unix operating system, 4 whetstone mega flop polysillicon emitter with high bandwidth. It‚Äôs really important. 6-Ghz double metallization communication protocol, asynchronous backward compatibility, peripheral bus architecture, four wave interleave memory token ring interchangeable back plane. And this all happens in 15 nanosecond of capability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Wow sir. It must be really good stock. It might definitely go up.

**Peter :** Well if you buy companies like this kind of story. It is owning sh9t tbh. It will never make money. So shall you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Huh, why.

**Peter :** Well what would you do if your stock goes from 69 to 9. Will you buy more or walk around the block and call your friends.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir it already is. All these stocks are down like 70%+. xD

**Peter :** That is the problem. Look man. I buy stocks like Dunkin Donuts, Stop and Shop, CBS, Sallie Mae. Do you know this Sallie Mae is kinda interesting. Not many people look at it. Imagine loaning money to students and no one looked at it. These are the kind of stuff i buy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Oh i see. You mean sir find the **hidden stock that no-one is looking at which has nice and simple business.** Easy to understand. Got it.

**Peter :** You say right now you will but I know you won‚Äôt do this. Because you don‚Äôt wanna know the story of the stock.

 

**Me :** Sir I will. Trust me. By the way sir i always wanna ask you a way to predict how high the Fed funds rate will go. I mean what technicals do you guys look at? Do I have to watch dot plots and forward guidance by the Fed and do some integral calculations to calculate recession.

**Peter :** What's wrong with you? No. **Stop trying to calculate when the recession is going to happen or when the stock market will go up/down or how high the interest rates would go.** Tbh, I would love to get next year's wall street journal. But you just don't.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir I can get it for you. I have this machine. Oh sh9t sorry sir. I only have fuel for one journey.

**Peter :** God. Why do you wanna mess with timelines? Anyway, I remember in 1982 we had a 20% prime rate, 15% government bonds, double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. I don't remember anyone telling me about that in 1980 they did though in 1981. But in 1983 I remember they said well the economy bounced back well but we will have a recession 85. In 85 they said recession 86. Something happened in 87 October. Everyone lost like 7 figures. Something bad happened. Then they said sure recession 88 and then they said 89 for sure recession and then in 90 we were supposed to have this so called soft landing which we never had. So in general I always tell this to others. **If you spend 13 minutes in economics you have wasted 10 minutes.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Don't worry about me sir. I never even attended a business school. Haha.

**Peter :** Look, all you wanna about the stock **market is it goes up and goes down. Sometimes it goes down a lot.** It‚Äôs good to know what's gonna happen with the economy but **I deal with facts.** If inventories are going back, if copper prices are going down, if room occupancy is going the wrong way, people are building too many hotels. I look at freight cars holdings, railroad stocks. I deal with facts. **I don't deal with people telling me something's gonna happen in future.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir but i can predict and i have been right so far.

**Peter :** Do you have a psychic line or something? You don't really get it. Do you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** I don't know. 

**Peter :** Well look you have got plenty of time. Right? Why are you in a rush to buy a stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir because whenever i go on fancy dates. The girl asks me my net worth. So i just say i'm waiting for the right moment. 

**Peter :** Oh God. Look man. **You could have bought Walmart 10 yrs after it went public you would have made 30 times your money**. Just so because you waited. Why cant they be in 15 or 18 or lets say 26% of the entire Usa.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir now its just at every state except one.

**Peter :** That‚Äôs not the point. The point is you have plenty of time in this business.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir i‚Äôm quite confused. I get scared sometimes from stocks. Hence I advised my people on Wall street bets to get bonds. At least they would make above 3%. But sir they called me chicken little.

**Peter :** Look man there is nothing to be scared of stocks. Lemme give you 10 most basic dangerous things about stocks. By knowing them already you would not get scared later on.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone down already it cannot go much lower‚Äù**

There was a stock called Polaroid. It went from 140 to 107. People said if it goes under 100 just back up the truck. Eventually it broke 100 and went to 18 in nine months.

I had an experience one time with Kaiser in Fidelity. We were gonna buy the biggest block ever in history 10-15M shares. Stock had gone from 29 to 17. I called my mom and asked how much lower it could go. Then it went to 10, 9 and to 7, 6 , 5 , 4. Fortunately this happened rapidly otherwise I would have been working at Stop and See. This all happened in 6 months. I was a little early at 15 and 3 quarters as my avg price. We call this premature in business. Had a correction which you know is a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly. Then again did an analysis. They own a lot of things steel, aluminium, cable etc. Funny thing is they had no debt. No one has ever gone bankrupt w/o debt. So i thought it wont go to 0. But they did. So they sold all businesses and gave back the shares. Eventually they were then sold to some company for $55/share. I also saw Taco bell go from 14 to 1 in 1974. They too had no debt and making 60c/share.

So never say the stock can‚Äôt go any lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*In my mind. Hmm, I will buy Microsoft and Apple at $1 someday. Sir what are the other 9 i wanna know more.

**Peter :** Well here‚Äôs the corollary to the above one. 

&amp;#x200B;

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone high already, how could it possibly go any higher‚Äù**

So Philips Morris was a stock that was adjusted for splits. Sold for 12c in 1951. Then it went to 60c in 1961. So everybody was wondering how high it could go. It has already gone 5x. These experts of the markets underestimated the power of Marlboro. They missed that there are 220 countries in the world. They missed cash flow. They missed everything. This stock was 100 bagger after going up 5x. But people sold it just because they thought how much higher it could go. They did the same with home depot, I did the same with ToysRuz. 

So just don't this okay. It‚Äôs a very bad thing and dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Here's another one that sucks. ‚ÄúEventually they always come back‚Äù**

Rca just about to get back to its 1929 price was backed out by G. Manville never came back. International harvester even with its name changed and adjusted for splits doesn't get all.way back. Western Union, Double Knits ( floppy disks ) These stocks don't have to come back. But people say they will eventually come back. This is all not true.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Wooah sir. That is too much to process. Can you slow it down a bit.

**Peter :** Can you just keep it up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Hmm Did i underestimate Tesla by selling at $1000+ and used the cash for buying Nio to recover to its original price.

**Peter :** \*\* I know this guy doesn't get anything. Well here's another one for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. ""Suppose you buy a stock at $3 how much can you lose""**

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Obviously $3.

**Peter :** Okay so tell me suppose your neighbour bought $10,000 worth of stock at price $50. And the stock is now at $3. You put $25000 at the price $3. If it goes to 0 who loses the most.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sir, wait a sec. Can I use this calculator lying on the desk.

**Peter :** God why do you need a calculator? Just think logically.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Ahh. I think my neighbour.

**Peter :** God you're stupid. Just figure out this on your way home. Here‚Äôs another one and better start writing these all points down.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. ""It‚Äôs always darkest before the dawn"" ""Business is awful terrible""** 

Here‚Äôs this one you will be talking  before lunch. Freight car deliveries. In 1979 there was 96,000 freight cars in USA. Two yrs later. It fell to 45,000. The lowest in 23 yrs. From 96 to 45 thousand. People always say business is horrible pathetic. Then it falls to 25,000. They say just load up. There‚Äôs about 15 opportunities to lose money. There‚Äôs about 15 supplier of freight cars and 15 manufacturers. Then last year we shipped 7000 freight cars. Business now was continuing to get miserable.

There is a great opportunity to lose money in energy services industry. In 1982 there were 11,000 oil rigs drilling holes in Okhloma, Texas, Colorado. We used to recount them every week. Rig count fell from 11,000 in 1982 to 6,000 in 1983. And then some more in 1984. There‚Äôs hundreds of companies here. Mud, down hole, fracturing companies, Well companies. All measuring companies the chambers the bid companies. Lots and lots of opportunities to lose money here. Also equal opportunities for serious losses. People always say business is terrible. Lets buy these groups. The rig count was now 1000 three yrs ago.

**So just saying business cant get any worse. It can always do more.** Once upon a time i had a textile industry in addition to metals. You then follow companies like JP Stevens, West roll pepper which were founded in 18th century. Burlington is new one which was founded in 1904. These people have been through recession, depression , world war. They have seen it all. There is a great expression in Texas industry. 

**It‚Äôs always darkest before pitch black.**

So remember if business is terrible it can always go terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Tech is doomed. Every thing is going to 0. Sir more more.

**Peter :** Yah yah.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. ‚ÄúWhen it rebounds to 10 i will sell""**

Well you see this stocks went to 4 and people think it goes to 10 they will sell. So if they are really that confident shouldn't you buy more. That's like 66% return. But they think nope. They will sell. What you ought see never put down a round number. Stock will always go to 7 or 9. Never to 10.

The first first rule you need to know here is : **Stock does not know you own it**. Doesn't matter how bad of a person you are with 69 spouses. If you own Coke for last 50 yrs the stock has gone 300x. You could be national hero, give donations, help cure cancer or aids but if you own Bethlehem steel. The stock is lower than it was 30 yrs ago.

So its not your fault. Don't take this personally. But people treat stock like grandchildren or puppy. They think stock knows who you are.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. ""I own conservative stocks, i don't have to worry""**

Public service Indiana went down 90%. Gulf state Indiana, long on lighting. This is oxymoron we own quality Texas banks that went to 0. We had quality new England banks that went to 0. These are companies that have been around 120-150 yrs.

Lot of people don't inherit a stock from somebody. They‚Äôll say my mother said on deathbed. Don't sell the long island lightning. These so called conservative stocks like Eastman Kodak fell 75%, Ibm fell 75%.

**Don't tell anybody you own conservative stock. Companies are very dynamic.**

&amp;#x200B;

**7. ""Look at all the money I‚Äôve lost because i didn't buy it""**

People say this all the time. I didn't own blockbuster, home depot. Even i myself made a list of some 200 stocks that went 100x that i didn't own. But people always worry about missing Microsoft, western digital, united airlines. People always worry about these kind of things. 

**So remember. You cannot lose money in stocks if you don't own it. The only way to lose money in stock market is you buy stock, it goes down and you press sell button. This is the only way.**

I swear people spouse cut newspaper in morning and there they say i was gonna buy Microsoft when it was at 3. I lost 3000 in Microsoft last night while i was sleeping. I was gonna buy 17000 shares of semiconductor at 10. Its now at 17. I lost 49000 on national semiconductor.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. ""I will miss this one but i will catch the next one""**

This usually does not work. There‚Äôs a lot of copycats of Toysrus there‚Äôs trial world. There was lionel. There‚Äôs copycats of home depot. **Buying a next of something doesn't work.** It‚Äôs really bad. It‚Äôs like buying on dips. Better way is to buy from dips.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. ""Stock has gone up i must be right. Stock has gone down i must be wrong""**

I‚Äôm convinced people do this every time. They buy stock at 10 very little. It goes to now 13. They say they don't know anything more than they knew when they were at 10. It‚Äôs at 13 now. 

The best thing that could happen to them is if stock directly go from 10 to 4. But for these people it eventually will go 4 but it goes 13 in middle. They convinced now. They bought 100 shares at 10. They now buy 20,000 at 13. All the fact is stock went from 10 to 13 as it went up. 

**The average movement of stock in this century b/w its high and low has been 50%. Stock goes up and down a lot. Stock goes up means you're right doesn't mean a damn thing.**

&amp;#x200B;

**10. ""Avoid long shots""**

**This is called whisper stocks.** These stocks will grow your hair, make your kid have better spelling and your breasts can improve and you won't have to iron your pants. Its those stocks that will do everything for you. These stocks don't have any sales yet. But my god if this works its gonna be the next xerox. It‚Äôs going to help murder in space and everything. It‚Äôs very good. 

Now this is not a long shot **its a no shot.**

I have tried 30 of these and i have never broken even on a long shot. Never. I made 25 or 30 times money on stocks i never thought about like Sallie Mae or Mbia, Fannie Mae or some of the banks. Stop and shop made 20 times to 30 times of money. 

**So if you go into stocks thinking you will make 4-20 times of your money then probably that stock won't work for you. Long shot don't work.**

And if you do wanna buy them at $3 and you know its gonna do a 100x. Meaning it will go $300. So write a story down at $3 and wait a few months after it goes $13 just check whether they started doing sales yet or not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Noting everything down. Woaah sir. Thank a lot for this tips. Sir can you please tell me the other things that you look at and what all skills do i need to pick right stock

**Peter :** Look man. You will find many people in this industry telling you to look at management or be Math's Olympiad winner etc. Trust me you don't need any of that. Here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Management**

Management is a very important thing for a company. But for an outsider to differentiate b/w average, good or worst management is tough to do. You only get an hour to decide. How do you know what decisions they didn't make. A lot of good decision company made is when they didn't made an acquisition. Or they didn't get rid of division.

**So the best decision is to buy a company that any fool can run.** Like ex Toyzrus. Any fool even you can run the company. They had the right formula to begin with with no competition. What they were doing had no copycats. They were gonna steam roll for next 25 yrs. Same with circuit city. 

In the end the story should be solid. If management can add anything on top of it. Great. Don't buy a company if someone tells you it has great management. Great management is always attached to how much has stock gone up last yr. Look at Reynolds metals. The stock had same person for 30 yrs. When Aluminum was tight they say Reynolds had great management. Aluminium got oversupplied they said these people are idiots Aluminium gets tight again they say people are terrific. All it had to do was with the stock price. And they kept writing how it had great management with how stocks were doing. So again **it's very hard to measure management.** If you get a chance to see them in action for 1-2m then sure. But you don't get that kind of chance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*I‚Äôm so gonna get rekt in Coinbase. The guys in All in podcast told me Brian Armstrong have excellent control of management. Sir do tell more.

**Peter :** Well another thing is

&amp;#x200B;

**- Be Flexible**

People have these biases or prejudices that they won't buy high growth companies, they will say no to financials, they won't buy savings and loans, they won't buy companies with letter R. So don't cut yourself to just one segment.

&amp;#x200B;

Another important thing is 

**- Math :**

I was very good at math's till multiplying and then calculating speed distances all sorts of stuff. But then they introduced cosine one day. Then came tangent, cotangent and area under the curve with some integral calculus. This is all garbage seriously for the stock market. You don't need this all kind of stuff for picking stocks. But for some reason Hedge funds and institutions guys do. **If you can just add 8+8 and get answer close to 16. That's all you need in the stock market.**

&amp;#x200B;

400M in debt, no cash, no equity and company losing money = bad stock. Forget it.

300M in cash, no debt, 200M in net worth, they are losing 10M on a quarter = they will be around.

If you passed 5th grade you will make it in this field. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** So sir you're saying if i go and barge Fidelity, Bridge Water or Black rock doorsteps tomorrow. They will sign me up for the job just because i can do 3rd grade maths.

**Peter :** Well they should.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Yes. If this Wsb post didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôm going there tomorrow.

**Peter :** \*\*I hope he gets kicked out of the door at Fidelity. Well moving on here‚Äôs another most important thing to know about.

&amp;#x200B;

**- ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always something to worry about‚Äù**

Look, the thing is everybody has got the brainpower to do well in the stock market. The Question is whether you **have the stomach for it.** That‚Äôs the key organ. There‚Äôs always something to worry about. I grew up as a kid in their 50's. In the decade of the 50's there‚Äôs a big theory that depression was caused by the stock market crash. Totally wrong.

Less than 1% of American owned stock in 1929. We had this big time depression. It wasn't caused by the stock market. It was that the economy went down and the Fed raised rates and we had a big time depression. In fact we had several depressions from 1850 on. But people thought the only reason we got depression was World war 2 and they said once we get back next time if a recession comes then that recession will turn into depression. And its gonna be ‚ÄúGreat Depression‚Äù I never understood this adjective before Depression. Like there could be ""Crummy depression"" or ""Bad depression"" too. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Great Depression](https://preview.redd.it/i6e10fpqgce91.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae4040118dc33f90f4245ff9fc6a38e76d525fae)

&amp;#x200B;

**So people weren‚Äôt buying stocks in 50's because they thought another ‚ÄúGreat Depression‚Äù was going to happen.** In addition people were very scared about nuclear warheads and war in the 1950's. People were building fallout shelters, stocking mccan goods. There‚Äôs something about going into Vermont and building a fallout shelter putting canned goods in it that you don't buy at Minnesota mining. Your‚Äôe buying lots of water, shotguns, buying frozen food that will stay in freezer with your own generator. And you‚Äôre looking at growth stocks. It doesn't seem to work out that way. I remember in my class in 1950's. Someone would come over and blew whistle and you get under your desk. I thought at that time it wont do us any good. But people were worried about nuclear war and depression in 1950's. The war heads couldn't do that damage in 1950's. But everyone was like they could blow up the entire world. We now stopped worrying all about this. 

The 50's in my opinion was best decade of the century except for the 80's. Slightly better. People didn't expect a lot. It was just okay. We made it through and stock market was terrific. You know there was a time oil went from 4 to 40 and expert said they would go to 100 and all countries in world would go bankrupt. And then big banks go bankrupt and we are gonna have ‚ÄúGreat Depression‚Äù and stock market would go down and you wind up selling pencils and apples. The Oil went from 4 to 40 and expert said it will go 100 but then 2 yrs later it went to 14. The expert now much higher paid at this point are saying its gonna go to 4 and we are gonna have depression. Can you believe it?

&amp;#x200B;

[Oil : $4 to $40.](https://preview.redd.it/0p2cpix7hce91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06030e7d0e8e0f9c51b76209448021a25722edfd)

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Nope. \*\*Hmm JP Morgan said similar thing with Oil $350. Are they all f'ing with us.

**Peter :** I remember one time it was money supply going too fast. We are gonna have depression. They were going too slow then too we were gonna have depression. Then there was Ldc debt. All the banks were very smart and lend all their net worth to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Chile and bunch of all other countries that are hard to pronounce. These countries weren't doing well and were less developed. Now we have to call them emerging countries. It‚Äôs politically very incorrect to call a country an undeveloped country. The other day i found out that the term for somebody overweight is laterally challenged. So there was this rumor that all these Ldc debts given to countries were going to go bankrupt. And we were gonna have depression.

Then there was Mid-east fighting going on and they weren‚Äôt gonna buy our bonds and market crashing and we would have depression. And then there was Japan crisis. They weren‚Äôt gonna buy our bonds and we were gonna have depression. Within 3 yrs Nikkei index went from 40,000 to 16,000. The banking system was in trouble. People said Japan was gonna collapse. And we were gonna have depression. Then there were issues like Global warming and real estate etc. 

**So the thing is as older as you get the more nervous you become of all these things. Younger people are hence better investors coz they are not worried and they haven't heard about all these crisis.** If you don't have any kids you gotta rent kids for weekend. Seriously. And ask him about money supply. Ask him about the shape of yield curve is it bad or good. Or that we are into 48.3 months of economic recovery. The average recovery is less than 52.3 months. Ask an 8 yr old about all this. The reason being they have high exp of about the next 20 yrs. That‚Äôs what you need to do.

The more you get away from 8 yr old, the more you start reading about these crazy things from weekend. You are not gonna make it.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact from 1955 to 1985 the stock market went up grand total of 1000 pts but it was down 800 on Mondays. So there it was 1800 up on non Mondays. It wasn't accident that stock market went down in October 1987 on Monday. People on the weekend become economists in portfolio strategies. I remember this day on Monday. I took vacation a week before. My fund went from 13B to 9B in two working days. So there was this rumor circulating that i knew market was gonna go down on Monday.

**In all i wanna say i can guarantee you that the market is gonna be lot higher in 15 yrs. It will be a lot higher in 25 yrs.** What‚Äôs it gonna do in the next 1 or 2 yrs i have no idea. Here‚Äôs a cool thing about interest rate. If you get them right 5 times in a row with ten grand you can have $2B. There is not lot many people with $2B and still lot of people take credit for predicting interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

So in general i don't care about all of this. **All i know In 96 yrs of century market has fallen 53 times with 10% or more decline.** That means once every 2 yrs we have 10% decline. Out of 53 declines 15 have been 25% or more. So 15 times in 96 yrs. **That is once every 6 yrs market falls 25% or more.** That‚Äôs what we call bear market. It‚Äôs all gonna happen but i don't care when its gonna happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me ;** Wow sir that's a lot. Anything you wanna add more.

**Peter :** You want more. Okay  

Here‚Äôs a quick summary of some more points that you need to keep in back of your mind :

* Don't forget about **investing internationally.** I made a bunch of my money there because of less coverage by the media and less people interested in following companies.
* **There‚Äôs always a company that is mispriced.** If you look at 10 you will find one. If you look 100 you will find 10. So go out there and find them.
* Most people ask me ‚ÄúWhen to sell a stock‚Äù Well i always tell them whatever the reason was for **buying the stock that must be your reason to sell** and when.

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs a really cool piece of advice you‚Äô‚Äôll love it.

**Me :** Yes sir. Do tell.

**Peter :** Diversification is sh9t. I call it diefaecation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** What? Everybody on Youtube tells me to diversify my portfolio.

**Peter :** They are probably a bunch of fools. I call them amateur. **Just own one damn good stock**. No need to buy 2 and 3 and balance their beta alpha whatever. This all makes investing so easy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** So sir you‚Äôre telling me to place all my chips in one basket.

**Peter :** Look man while buying a stock you have to know a good story. **If you come across 10 good. I do that too. Find 10 good attractive companies.** It makes me feel like i‚Äôm watching a poker game. So story 3 gets better, but story 6 get flops, story 7 remains same but it goes up 50% so sell 7 and buy 2.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir you just told me to pick one earlier. Now you're telling me to pick 10. What is it?

**Peter :** God you're the worst guy ever I have come across. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Sorry. \*Sad face

**Peter :** Okay. Don‚Äôt start crying now. Here i will give the three total BS advise that you will ever come across.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*Excited Yes sir. Do tell.

**Peter :**  

&amp;#x200B;

* Women can't control money and deal with personal finance.
* We are in 4th innings of bull market
* And number 3rd which could be possible true. There will be a lot less US banks in future because UK has very less banks

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** None of that is useful to me

**Peter :** \*\*Angrily gets out of chair. God get out of my house. You have done nothing but wasted my 2 hrs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** What did i do

**Peter :** You keep asking these stupid question in b/w and never get anything at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*\*Maybe its because i have been scrolling lots of sh9tposts recently

**Peter :** Just go back to wherever you came from man.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** But sir i think we are heading to depression. I just don't know if its Stagflationary or Deflationary

**Peter :** Were you even making notes in the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Yes sir. I was.

**Peter :** So just read your goddamn notes and get out. Never come back here again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*Walks to door. 

**Peter :** \*Shuts the door on my face.

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** Hmm i forgot to ask him about this balance sheet

&amp;#x200B;

[Can you identify the balance sheet?](https://preview.redd.it/jz1zy7yhdce91.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4b4229b324b3ffc5c40e685145e17ef1c3293a)

&amp;#x200B;

**Peter :** This upcoming generation is gonna be poor. Just no imagination on how the stock market works.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Me :** \*Heads back to home. So what did i miss. Lemme check. Wtffff. Its July 28 and the Gdp is -ve. Technical recession. Yesss. Exactly as i predicted. Man imma genius of Wall Street i predicted 8.8% above inflation and now this Gdp.

 

\*Checks the market 

What the f‚Ä¶.. Why is the market going up. Huhhhhhh.

&amp;#x200B;

# The End.

Thank you for reading this guys. I hope you enjoyed it. Tbh you can get this advise from watching Peter Lynch seminar from 90's or reading any of his books. I don't hold any rights to call this my article. Also my strategy is clearly different since i'm the ""Depressing bear"" that Lynch hates. Hence I put these kinds of content in specials. I also do hope you get the underlying meaning associated with this conversation held and try relating it with current scenario. If you do then comments down below to share your experience. I love hearing your opinion guys.

Unfortunately I think I severely underestimated the bulls today‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt let the market drop on FOMC like I expected. I don‚Äôt know if its cause of the bigger run up we had intraday before FOMC or what the reason was. But I expected at least a 0.5 to 1% drop with 392 being my target. We never even dropped 0.3% below $395 before she rocketed‚Ä¶ candles double bottomed off 395.47 and then it was gone from there. 

My plan was to execute a trade at 235pm and get into it. I missed my entry and watched my premium rocket. I was not going to chase it so I sat this one out. Thankfully a lot of people in the server really profited today off this trade and this entry time. I guess I was still in vacation mode and missed my opportunity. With the capital I planned to risk‚Ä¶ it had to be perfect for me to want to enter it and it just wasn‚Äôt 100% what I expected or wanted so I sat it out. It was not very fun watch it go by and sleeping on the entry though.

This FOMC had a few interesting things about it though‚Ä¶ 

First off it was the first FOMC that we didn‚Äôt have a red week leading up to it. As you can see below the average drop this year for FOMC (not including January) was 1.2% and we barely dropped 0.3%. The new average is 0.98% drop‚Ä¶ we dropped about 25% of what was expected. We also only rallied 1.9% from 230pm to EOD high. This was about 67% of the expected rally and about 73% of the new average rally. The other weird thing was the volume the Average volume for the FOMCs this year (including January) is 141mil for the day we barely broke 80 mil today. 

*Processing img o689d80gg6e91...*

So where are we? Okay a couple things we need to keep in mind from this meeting and for tomorrow‚Ä¶ we now have 8 weeks till the next FOMC meeting. JPOW did say we are not CURRENTLY in a recession, however, we haven‚Äôt had the 2nd gdp number for him to say we are‚Ä¶ they for the first time ever said ‚Äúwe are taking this meeting to meeting‚Äù and he said that we are still expecting some aggressive rate hikes in the future. The fed for the first time that I have heard said they are downgrading the economy‚Ä¶ they are working off high job growth and low unemployment (when this changes we should be concerned). JPOW did confirm inflation is too high still (duh). Fed is no longer going to provide clear guidance for the future and future hikes like they have in the past. JPOW said the path to a soft landing is quickly narrowing and getting further and further away. No decision or timeline to end rate hikes or slow them. 

The weirdest thing he said was ‚Äúthe first GDP reading is usually heavily revised‚Ä¶‚Äù I think this is going to come back around.

SO as you can see on the SPY daily we had a pretty major break through of 3 different daily resistance lines today. We also closed over the JPM morgan collars top. The last time we were at the JPM morgan collar we rejected it. This will be interesting to watch play out. The current trajectory we are on could have us resting the orange channel resistance of 411 by August 5th. If we break through that we are actually looking at a possibility of testing the overall bear market channel resistance of 433 by August 18th. If we were to break that green channel resistance at the top this month‚Ä¶ it would confirm bear market is 100% over. That would make a higher high for the first time since January. 

We FINALLY gap filled 401.44 today after trying for the last 1.5 months to fill it. 

We are at a pretty important time here on SPY‚Ä¶ I fully expect a red open tomorrow due to GDP and due to post FOMCs almost always being red. 

https://preview.redd.it/w8tdvq8ig6e91.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1662d7d80e07ab97a889e40905aaffcf32096d2b

The last two FOMC days we have see -3%+ red days and had red opens. With GDP tomorrow it‚Äôs the perfect storm for a nice red day to not only play puts overnight but to find a call loading opportunity. 

Overall I am going to be looking for a call buying opportunity around 394.5 (-1.7%) support test tomorrow. If we break through that support this breaks the upwards trajectory and we could be looking for a restest of 390.9 (-2.6%) support test. I suspect this 390.9 support to hold but if that fails then we start thinking about the 378 gap. Market is in such perma bull mode right now its hard to believe we break back down to 378 gap fill right now. 

Bulls are going to look to break through and close over 401.5 resistance and will now be targeting close over the daily 100ema of 407 (1.5%) tomorrow. From there we just slowly start picking away and resistance line after resistance line.

Futures painting a fairly similar picture‚Ä¶ broke some impressive resistance lines today and held support line nicely this morning/ overnight. Overall I will be watching futures more closely as it has been the guide to where we are going next. 

Futures bulls are going to target holding support of 4003 (-0.5%) and then 3960 (-1.5%) tomorrow. Holding 3960 is crucial for bulls tomorrow. Bulls will be looking to break above the daily 100ema at 4080 (1.5%). From there bulls are targeting that orange channel resistance at 4123 (2.6%)  by August 5th. The biggest fight and resistance will take place at 4180 (3.9%) if bulls make it there. 

Bears goal tomorrow is to break through that 3960 support line. From there we start back testing supports at 3920 (-2.5%). 3920 is a major support that bulls can not give up. From there we starts looking at further supports such as 3828 (-4.8%) and 3785 (-6%).

Am I bullish or am I bearish? Well this ones a tough one. FOMC is the wildcard that moves markets more then it should. I don‚Äôt believe a 2.6% green day was very warranted today personally. So my expectation is that we do see a pretty large retrace tomorrow. Also statistically/ historical data speaking we should see a red day (most likely very large) after a FOMC meeting. With GDPs potential 2nd reading coming out tomorrow I suspect that markets are going to be down pre market and at 830 when that news drops (especially with a spike in jobless claims) we will see a very red day. The risk to reward of puts overnight is very high in my opinion and well worth the position. 

Now if tomorrow opens green and we hold green/ close green tomorrow im going to be going full bull here until the market says otherwise. Pretty much the last two weeks now dips have been buying opportunities. GDP is pretty much bears last chance tomorrow to scare the market into a dump. It will be interesting to see what happens. It also worries me how the two trading days before today were both the lowest volume of the year and today was the lowest volume FOMC day this year (about 60% of normal average fomc volume). 

There is an argument that markets are waiting for GDP tomorrow before they full send it bullishly. Depending on how tomorrow plays out I will be looking at some 30dte calls for an expectation that we reach 430 by the end of August. If I don‚Äôt position long (safer not to) I will at least intraday be bullish and trust run ups more than I have before. 

Overall it‚Äôs a very weird market right now when you factor in volume and realistically all the terrible news and bearish catalysts we have‚Ä¶ despite all that we are either truly having the worlds greatest bear market rally or we are seeing the bottom truly be in. Apple is about $1 (at close) from breaking through MAJOR resistance. If apple breaks through $157.66 tomorrow ($158 for confirmation) then apple has officially broke its overall 2022 bear channel‚Ä¶ and it will be the return of the bull run. As crazy as it is to say‚Ä¶ there is a case to be made that Apple retests its ATH by end of August‚Ä¶

10% challenge- 

Despite having the plan for pretty much a month now of how I was going to tackle FOMC day‚Ä¶ I blew it 100%. I did not like when I saw that the markets did not dump at least 0.5%. I was intently watching at 235pm for what it was going to do and before I could enter the entry was gone. 

The other thing I really didn‚Äôt like about today was the IV. The IV never really crushed till after 3pm. We have in the past seen a pretty good IV crush from 215 to 230pm but today we saw IV stay in the 80s the whole time. It made premiums very high and with the smaller then usually move the usually 300-500% gains were not there at all. If you timed the entry perfectly most were seeing 150-200% gains. 

I did a swing SPX over night to hold but took 10% and repositioned into a 4010p for tomorrow. I suspect this will pay out nicely tomorrow. If im wrong the risk to reward was good enough to warrant this play for me. Overall with no IV pump I need a 4005 open -0.4% open for breakeven.

Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter.

**Fundamentals**

As of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was \~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of \~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of \~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology.

Other than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc.

**Current Policies**

Well, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan.

I think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.

We all know how ""frugal"" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html))

While the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain. (source: [https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel\_germany\_tsmc/#:\~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel_germany_tsmc/#:~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber).)

**Recent History**

In the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&amp;D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months).

Sometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&amp;D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of ""I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet"" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back.

Also, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/)). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers.

**Final Thoughts**

The biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock.

Another thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: [https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:\~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30](https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30)) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance.

While smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run.

Intel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such. Thank you!",Bullish Argument for $INTC,1.0,2022-07-26 18:57:45

""If [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell says, 'we're getting a 75 basis point rate hike and then we'll see what happens' ‚Ä¶ then you might get a rip-snorting rally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.


""On the other hand, if he says we're doing the triple-rate hike and then we're willing to keep tightening no matter what, including a possible inter-meeting hike if the CPI stays hot, then we are definitely going lower,"" he added, referring to June's hotter-than expected 9.1% inflation reading.

The Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and many analysts expect a 75 basis point rate hike. 

Cramer also previewed this week's slate of earnings. All earnings and revenue estimates are courtesy of FactSet.

711,1658846608,w8ll0v,1,"Ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech earnings later this week, Ed Yardeni has some words of comfort: the worst has passed for this bear market.

In the view of the Yardeni Research president, the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs plunge last month to a 3,666.77 low likely marked the trough of the 2022 equity rout. Underpinning the sanguine call is the resilience in corporate earnings and the still-healthy outlook for consumers and businesses even as the economy slows.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never easy to pick a bottom in the stock market, but I‚Äôm going to give it a try,‚Äù Yardeni said on Bloomberg TV. ‚ÄúThe real question is going to be the earnings season, and so far the earnings season is going reasonably well. It has not really thrashed the stock market, and the stock market‚Äôs held up quite well.‚Äù

The statement is a large one ahead of a decisive week -- the Fed looks all set for another supersized interest-rate hike on Wednesday, while most mega-cap technology companies, including Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon, Inc, Microsoft Corp and Meta Platforms Inc, will release their earnings reports.

Yardeni appears to be in the minority. In Bank of America Corp.‚Äôs survey this month, money managers said they‚Äôve cut their equity exposure to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, a sign of no faith in recent market bounce. At the end of June, a Deutsche Bank AG poll showed 72% of respondents expected the S&amp;P 500 to fall to 3,300 first, rather than rallying to 4,500.

But if Yardeni‚Äôs track record is any indication, it‚Äôs worth heeding the view of a market veteran who coined terms like ‚ÄúFed Model‚Äù and ‚Äúbond vigilante.‚Äù The strategist, who worked at Oak Associates Ltd. and Deutsche Bank before founding his namesake research firm, called the equity bottom the same month when the 1982 bear market ended.

So back in the 1980s, Texas Instruments was this company that made calculators... and computer chips, and it was basically dead.  Then, in 1986, they started enforcing their patents and suing the hell out of everyone.  Today they've got a market cap of $149 Billion and a PE ratio of 18.  In 2003 their stock was trading at 1.81.  It's at 161 now, and has been recently as high as 200.  

So, if you go read a news story about Apple and a settlement today, you'll find a ticker mentioned on the other side of that deal that basically now owns the patent rights to literally everything in wireless audio.

There aren't any options on that stock, and both the market cap and float are miniscule.  It's a long term play, but for those of you who've been wiped out, and are posting the brutal loss porn, it's a solid choice to dump whatever you've got left in shares on and just waiting a couple years to get enough cash to get back to yolo'ing FDs like the real heroes you are.

724,1658667181,w6uyfr,1,"Get into Congress.

The minimum salary for a member of congress is $174,000 a year.  

Now, that might seem like a lot of money.  Maybe, even a life-changing amount After all, the average American makes about three times less. 

But, in reality, that numbepr means very little to many of our politicians. That six-figure check is pretty insignificant when you compare it to the wealth of someone like nancy Pelosi, whose net worth is somewhere upward of $115 million. 

For reference, that ridiculous amount of money puts her in the top 0.1% of Americans and makes her one of the wealthiest politicians in this country. 

If she had made all that through her salary alone, never spending a penny, and only ever cashing in her current all-time high house speaker salary of $239,000 she would have had to work for over 500 years. 

Now, Pelosi is not a vampire despite what some very convincing Facebook posts say.  So, where did all this money come from?  Where do any of our politicians make their money? 

As it turns out, Nancy's situation isn't all that unique. Many congress people see their wealth grow by thousands of percentage points after they're elected and the majority of our federal lawmakers are full-on millionaires. 

For reference, and I can't believe I feel the need to say this, most Americans not millionaires! So, where does all this money come from? 

Let's stick with Pelosi for a bit. There are a few ways she and other politicians make their money but the first one we obviously have to talk about is investment using Nancy's public records. 

Researchers at Open Secrets found that in 2018 she invested $46.5 million in real estate, another $15.8 million in electronics manufacturing, and a cool $15 million into just Apple, admittedly this doesn't tell us where the spending money first comes from, we'll get to that later but this information still matters a lot that's because, as it turns out, Nancy Pelosi is an investment genius. 

Investing and doing a bang-up job at it has been one of the big ways she and her husband paul have been able to multiply their fortunes during her tenure as a politician between 2020 and 2021. 

The Pelosi's traded over $50 million  in assets for an annualized return of 69%, nice! 

Now, that number doesn't mean anything to me except the obvious thing. So, I googled it and this is about six to seven times higher than the average stock market return, making her a better investor than Warren  Buffett, George Soros, and Kathy Wood, whose whole deal is investing! 

They don't spend any time holding elected office or anything.  The point is that these returns are incredibly lucrative, while millions of Americans fell into poverty because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pelosi's wealth grew by an eye-watering $16.7 million! 

So, of course, when a reporter asks her the question, ""Should members of Congress and their spouses be banned from tradingindividual stocks while serving in congress?""

She said, ""No!"" 

Okay, Pelosi is an incredibly ""talented""  investor and it might be tempting to single her out, but none of this is all that unusual. It turns out, Congress  people have always been surprisingly good at investing! 

You might remember these four from the start of the pandemic in February. This  one wrote this article where he says, ""The  U.S. is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats,"" but then a week later he did this. 

Weird. 

Well, not really before the rest of us knew how bad COVID-19 would get, but after internal briefings by the CDC and Fauci on the severity of the upcoming Pandemic. 

These four senators dumped a whole bunch of money they held in the stock market right as it was about to crash. They all made hundreds of thousands of dollars presumably using information not disclosed to the public. 

But, hey now, maybe they're just really good investors? 

The DOJ certainly seems to think so, since all the investigations into what they did have since been closed. 

Seems reasonable. 

Here again, I want to be clear that what these senators did is not special. I had led with the people with names and faces, but this trend is bigger than four senators and the Pelosi's. 

Congress people have always been surprisingly good at investing! 

A five-month-long business insider investigation found that at least 49 members of congress and 182 high-ranking congressional staffers engage in insider trading. 

Multiple successive academic reports that looked into senatorial stock returns have consistently found that, overall, senators are just really good at beating the market!

Why? Well, if you look at a 2017 report by Public Citizen about senators and stock trading, you'll find that many individual senators often trade stocks in businesses that they oversee in their official capacity. 

I'm no expert but this might be a problem, no? 

What do I know? I should just listen to people like Pelosi who always know what to say and have the best explanations for why this isn't a problem. 

Truly airtight arguments because this is a free market. 

Makes sense to me. Everybody say thank you to Mrs. Pelosi for that valuable lesson in economics but fine what if investments and abuses of information couldn't explain any of the astonishing wealth of our politicians? 

Another good place to look is lobbying. Lobbying is a very very well-funded industry. In 2021, $3.7 billion were spent on federal lobbying alone. 

As you can see from this list the top spenders are almost exclusively businesses large industries and the firms that represent them. 

You can put that info on a graph and it looks like this, Labor and Citizen special interests represent almost nothing. If lobbying were a bag of Chex mix, you'd be getting like one rye chip per 50 handfuls of pretzels. 

But, the thing with lobbying is that it doesn't work like an outright bribe. There's a lot of money in lobbying but in the grand scheme of things, the amounts that are actually spent mean very little to the politicians. 

While I can tell you that Nancy Pelosi got $180k from officially registered lobbyists,  she's not really getting that money for herself. That money mainly goes into campaign financing and then there's all sorts of amounts not on this list that go into things like, extravagant dinners. 

In any case, it's not where the millions of dollars in the Pelosi bank account are coming from, lobbying gets money into political hands in a much more indirect way that's sustained by a mutually beneficial relationship to get the wheels turning on this relationship. 

Lobbies will get close to politicians using a business's wealth to build rapport that can be translated into favorable legislation or outright subsidies essentially. 

They'll pay for ways to sit at the same table at a nice restaurant or get an hour in the right office. 

Why? 

Well, one study estimates that every dollar spent on lobbying returns an average of $760. 

If that number seems a little high to you, and it might very well be, regardless of what the actual amount is, it will always be more than what's put in. 

Businesses wouldn't lobby if it didn't serve them. 

But, that's just what businesses get from lobbying, what about politicians? 

Well, for politicians, the benefits of lobbying are split between long-term and short-term benefits. 

In the long term, politicians know that two-thirds of them will leave politics to enter the lobbying industry once their years in government will have made them very valuable assets to lobbyists and therefore come with a nice big bag of money with a dollar sign on it. 

That means that politicians spend years in office greasing the revolving door that'll let them leave government with lucrative jobs in the industries they cozied up to during their tenure. 

But, that's for the long term. In the short term, cozying up to lobbyists can come with other more immediate benefits. 

For example, in 2008, after VISA made a few small contributions to Pelosi's campaign, her husband paul was granted privileged access to a VISA IPO, where he was able to invest a large sum of money before stock prices went up and all Nancy had to do was stall the passage of a law that would cut into VISA'S PROFITS. 

Which she did. 

But fine, let's keep going and assume investment and lobbying mean absolutely nothing to these people's wallets. 

The reality is a lot of our politicians are just exceptionally wealthy right off the bat. While a lot of politicians use their office as an elevator into the upper strata, many others come in fully formed using government only to exaggerate their already impressive wealth. 

That's the case for the Pelosi's whose shared

finances are built on the venture capital firm that Paul founded. The company with probably the least googlable name in the world:  

***FINANCIAL LEASING SERVICES***

I know I focused on the Pelosi's a lot in this video but this applies to like half our politicians and there's a reason for that. 

Being wealthy opens up a corridor to political life that being an average American just doesn't. 

At the personal level, being wealthy means you don't have to worry about keeping a full-time job while you run or making sure you have food on the table and a roof over your head. 

That's huge but that's not where the biggest benefits come from. The main reason the wealthy have such an easy time taking over politics comes from the fact that their incentives align with those of established parties. 

Political parties have an incentive to promote wealthier candidates and support them more because wealth begets wealth. 

Wealthy candidates come with wealthy connections that can be used to fundraise and finance ever more expensive campaigns. 

Wealthy candidates have a lot of friends who would all benefit from them winning and who will, therefore, be willing to raise money that parties can use to beat their opponents. 

Wealthy candidates also do not pose a threat to this model in a way that less wealthy more normal representatives do. 

If the only way you can get people into office is with generous checks from the wealthy, and that truly is the only reliable way to do it, then a candidate who opposes wealth of this kind threatens your party's whole electoral strategy. 

The wealthy do not want to finance a party that will take their dominant position in society away from them. 

People who do not look like you and me, who do not live the same lives, who do not face the same living conditions, make it into politics way more often just because it's easier for them than it is for a genuine representative of a country's citizens. 

Hence, this is why most Congress people are millionaires and most Americans aren't. 

And the thing is, there are real consequences. Our politics aredramatically influenced by all these different relationships to the capitalist class whether it's because of its disproportionate amount of seats at the table, its powerful use of lobbying, or the fact that it's in the best interest of politicians invested in the stock market to cater to capital. 

#These people are not like you, they do not represent you, and they don't act in your interest. 

This doesn't mean that not a single law gets passed that protects those who work for a living, those laws just aren't the priority they get artificially delayed, pared down to the bare minimum, and written carefully to only sacrifice the short-term interest of capital for the long-term survival of the capitalist economy. 

What matters is not the individual battles, it's that the overall outcome doesn't threaten profitability, the balance of power is on their side.

Wrestling it away and putting that power back in the hands of the people is the. first priority.","How to become a better investor than Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Kathy Wood",1.0,2022-07-24 12:53:01

Amazon has been on a streak recently. The wrong kind of streak, though. Disappointing investors. Revenues are expected to grow 6% to reach $119.5 billion. EPS is expected to get crushed due to inflationary pressures. Of course, AWS will be on focus.

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on ten analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.51. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $3.61. Revenue is also forecast to dip 0.2% to $29.0 billion due to weaker advertiser demand and lower ad prices on Facebook and Instagram.

Daily active users and monthly active users numbers will be in focus. Market participants will also pay attention to how much money Facebook is willing to spend on its reality labs segment.

**2. Macro Economic indicators**:

First, let‚Äôs start by saying that the macro picture is not looking good.

**A. PMI:**

Flash US PMI Composite Output Index registered 47.5 in July, down notably from 52.3 in June, to signal a solid contraction in private sector output. The rate of decline was the sharpest since the initial stages of the pandemic in May 2020, as both manufacturers and service providers reported subdued demand conditions.

**B. Philly Fed New Orders:**

Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is based on The Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in the Third Federal Reserve District. Participants report the direction of change in overall business activity and the various measures of activity at their plants: employment, working hours, new and unfilled orders, shipments, inventories, delivery times, prices paid, and prices received.

Philadelphia Fed said Thursday [its gauge of regional business activity](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/manufacturing-business-outlook-survey) dropped to negative 12.3 in July from negative 3.3 in the prior month.

Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal expected a 1.6 reading.

Any reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions in the manufacturing sector. This is the second straight month in contraction territory.

https://preview.redd.it/bd2pp4bqbgd91.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7409ed29e70c2ff987955877777902e535cc2aa9

**C. Dr. Copper**:

Copper (The commodity) predicts turning points in global economic cycles. The reason for that is because Copper is used in almost every sector. Demand for Copper is a reliable leading indicator of economic health. How do you gauge the demand? By looking at the price of Copper. Rising Copper prices indicate that demand for the commodity is strong, hence, a growing global economy. A decline in prices suggests the opposite. Copper had fallen into a bear market in the run-up to each of the last four recessions dating back to 1990, as the chart below shows.¬†Copper fell into a bear market from its peak (-24%) in May 2021.

 **D. Inverted Yield Curve** 

The yield curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the San Francisco Fed. And yes, the yield curve is inverted. 

 **3. Federal Reserve Rate hikes, inflation, and expectations:**

Currently, it seems like the Fed will stick to a 75 bps rate hike in July. In June inflation print was 9.1%, hitting 40 year high. Expectations were that the Fed would become more aggressive and hike rates by 100 bps (1%). Hawkish Fed members are supporting a 75 bps hike and not 100 bps.

 **4. GDP Release:**

Gross Domestic Product will be released Thursday, July 28, 2022. Economists were expecting the U.S. economy to fall into recession somewhere in 2023. On July 1st, the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker showed that the U.S. economy might already be in a recession. The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs GDPNow gauge sees the second quarter at a negative 2.1%. Coupled with the first quarter‚Äôs decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession.",The most important week of 2022.,1.0,2022-07-24 05:29:12

Introduction:

I would like to begin by saying that I have consumed an entire 96 pack of crayons prior to typing this so take this DD at your own risk. Essentially, I think we are in for a massive drop in the market in the short term. From now until September I expect the market to be in a downtrend. Below I am going to detail why I believe this to occur while shaking my magic 8 ball in one hand and gazing into my crystal ball with the other. Additionally, for those of you who comment and have stuck around for more than 1 of my DDs I just wanted to say I appreciate you all for doing so and I have had so much fun doing these. Enough of the sappy shit though, lets talk about how we all can make a one-way trip to tendie town. My current position is puts on QQQ as well as COIN. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0a23d5bxifd91.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c03e9a95e21c1a9b41a99b310981b534e310ad2

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why QQQ and COIN?

When I was taking a massive shit at work I pondered what my next position and DD would be. I could not think of anything, so I figured screw it, why not do QQQ and COIN. The pre-analysis train of thought being that in a nutshell, tech stocks had rallied too much in the past few weeks and that a rally was unsustainable in the current macroeconomic conditions. As far as COIN specifically, I called bullshit on them months ago with me first DD months ago and hit it big so I figured why not do so again when COIN has a 52 week low of under $50 a share and $70 puts were reasonably priced. Essentially COIN makes money through transactions, they do NOT need a bullish market in order to make money as they make the same amount off of selling. It is a brilliant business model except that volumes have been in a downtrend for the internet money the past few months as evidenced by Robinhood‚Äôs loss in volume as well as COIN‚Äôs own volume losses in each of their last earnings call. I expect this trend to continue for COIN and as a result I expect the share price to drop closer to their 52 week low allowing for some quick money.

What is QQQ?

QQQ tracks 100 NASDAQ listed stocks in proportion to their respective market capitalizations. This means that more weight is given to Apple rather than any other company due to their size. QQQ is a technology heavy index. Tech stocks are typically the most sensitive to increases in interest rates as their value depends on the value of future earnings. Tech stocks usually do not pay dividends and if they do they are very low so their share price is more sensitive to growth projections and rising interest rates are a great hindrance to growth as it will eat into profits, causing these high growth companies to slow in growth forecasts. Therefore, share prices drop as a result of tighter market conditions in terms of liquidity. Below are pictures of the market sectors that QQQ is in as well as QQQ‚Äôs top 10 holdings. Additionally, a picture showing QQQ‚Äôs price charted against the 10 year Treasury Rate further proves my point that rising rates are bad for Tech (and therefore QQQ‚Äôs) share price. When the Federal Funds Rate is raised this pushes up the 10 year Treasury Rates and while the relationship between QQQ‚Äôs share price and 10 Year Treasury Rates are not completely inversed there is negative correlation. When rates rise share prices fall and when rates fall share prices rise. (Yes the data is old but it still shows the appropriate relationship; Jan. ‚Äô21 ‚Äì Sep. ‚Äô21)

Macroeconomic Indicators

GDP: 

‚ÄúGDP represents the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a given period. The figure is usually given in nominal and real formats, with real GDP adjusting for changes in monetary value. Given its vast breadth, this indicator is among the most-watched by the financial markets. The expansion of a country's GDP is indicative of a growing economy, while a contraction in GDP indicates a slowdown in a country's economy. Meanwhile, a country's projected GDP growth rate can be used to determine an appropriate level of [sovereign debt](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-sovereign-debt-1978991) or determine if companies operating within the country are likely to experience growth.‚Äù

Q1 GDP came in negative. This is a massive deal because if Q2 GDP comes in negative on the 28th, by the textbook definition, that will signal a recession within the U.S. economy. In my opinion this would cause some irrational panic selling as investors and institutions shit themselves because of the ‚ÄúR‚Äù word. Below is the estimated Q2 GDP rate by the Atlanta Fed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Unemployment Rate:

‚ÄúThe productivity and wealth of a country's citizens is arguably the ultimate determiner of economic success. Employment indicators, such as labor force, payroll, and unemployment data estimate how many citizens are employed and whether they are making more or less money than before. The financial markets carefully watch these employment indicators, especially in developed countries that generate most of their income from domestic consumer spending. A fall in employment is often followed by a fall in consumer spending, which can hurt GDP statistics and overall economic growth prospects.‚Äù

Currently, we have very low unemployment here in the U.S. with it sitting at 3.6%. This would indicate tight labor markets for those looking to hire which is indicative of a strong economy. This only continues to give the Federal Reserve more conviction in continuing their interest rate hikes which as previously discussed is disastrous for tech stocks and therefore QQQ. Below is a graph of unemployment nationally from January 2021 ‚Äì June 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

CPI

‚ÄúCPI measures changes in the prices of consumer goods and services that are purchased by households. The index is a statistical estimate created by using prices from a sample of representative items collected periodically. Often times, this measure is used as a gauge of inflation, which can positively or negatively affect a country's currency. 

The financial markets carefully watch CPI figures for signs of inflation. Rising inflation can lead to higher interest rates and reduced lending, while deflation can lead to lower interest rates and greater lending.‚Äù

All I am going to say here is that the CPI has came in at the highest inflationary rates in over 40 years. Again, rates will be hiked aggressively as a result of this. Below is a graph of the CPI.

FOMC Meetings

‚ÄúCentral banks create monetary policy and exert significant control over a country's economy. Consequently, the financial markets tend to listen closely to every word that central bankers utter publicly for clues about the future. Central bank minutes are formal releases that contain valuable economic commentary that can signal future policy action.

In the U.S., the [Federal Reserve](https://www.thebalance.com/current-federal-reserve-interest-rates-4770718) issues what's called the Beige Book, which contains anecdotal information about current economic conditions from each Federal Reserve Bank. Similar notes are released by many other central banks, including the Bank of Japan, [European Central Bank](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-ltro-or-long-term-refinancing-operation-1979094) (ECB), and others on a regular or semi-regular schedule.‚Äù

Recently, the Federal Reserve in their entirety and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, have all taken a hawkish stance and said they will be aggressive in rate hikes. They have stated they will do whatever it takes in order to bring down inflation and restore price stability to the U.S. which essentially means ‚Äúwe do not give a shit if we RKO this country into a recession, we are going to bring down inflation no matter the pain it causes to the average and poor Americans‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

PMI

‚ÄúThe [Purchasing Managers' Index](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-purchasing-managers-index-pmi-1978996) (PMI) is an economic indicator developed by Markit Group and the Institute for Supply Management. By polling businesses on a monthly basis, the index reflects the acquisition of goods and services by purchasing managers. The two most important surveys are the PMI Manufacturing and PMI Services indices. 

The financial markets watch the PMI Manufacturing and PMI Services indices as key leading economic indicators because companies stop purchasing raw materials when demand dries up. This can indicate problems in an economy much before other reports like retail sales or consumer spending.‚Äù

Below is a graph of the PMI from July 2021 ‚Äì June 2022.

Concluding Thoughts:

All of the above information considered leads me to believe that markets are in for a rout in the very short term. I think this month and August could very well be an easy time to make money with a variety of bearish positions. I also would like to mention for those that may join me on this crazy journey, please do take profits at some point. If it is good enough to screenshot or brag about to your wife‚Äôs boyfriend, then it is good enough to sell. The worst thing to do when trading options is to get greedy. Additionally, sometimes cutting one‚Äôs losses is the best thing to do instead of holding contracts to expiration that expire worthless. By following those simple rules, I have managed to grow the $2950 I started with in May to $7050 today. If you want to see the contracts I made money on, they are in my previous posts. Although I was dead wrong on some of them I sold at 20% gains oftentimes before earnings or other crazy events that saved my ass. Anyways this is not financial advice, and I hope you all enjoyed the post, feel free to follow me for weekly or biweekly DD‚Äôs.

TL;DR

Given all of the dog shit economic indicators data that has came in the last few weeks, the current market rally is a fool‚Äôs errand. The market is going to lose most or all of what it has gained back in the coming weeks due to a recession confirmation and JPOW nuking the market with another 75 BPS (or maybe even full percent) interest rate hike.",A Bear's Revenge,1.0,2022-07-24 02:48:22
727,1658602931,w6bgpz,1,"EA stated that they're ""actively"" looking to get acquired or merge with another company.   
Here's list of potential companies they are in talk with: Apple, Amazon, Disney and Comcast

**Apple**

Biggest acquisition made by Apple was $3. IMO I don't see Apple strategy or brand align with EA nor they would acquire it at such valuation. Apple already makes shitton of money for gaming thru its app store without making a single game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon**

Gaming isn't part of Amazon core business so it would none sense to spend +$40B on acquiring mediocre gaming company. Also the timing is bad as interest rate is rising. Finally Amazon already acquired 2 companies MGM and One medical last Friday. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Disney**

Honestly I don't have much thought about Disney but it seems they are currently in deep debt after Fox acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Comcast**

NBC Reportedly Offered to Merge With EA but didn't go through

&gt;During the last month of discussions, the proposal didn't go through due to disagreements surrounding the price of the merger and how it would be structured.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sony** already acquired a gaming company for $3.7B

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

EA currently valued around $37B with 47 PE. Which will make cash acquisition a bit difficult in such time (inflation, interest rate, recession risk ..) as most of companies is trying to save cash. 

Apple and Amazon probably won't acquire it giving the lack of synergies.  
Microsoft and Sony already made an acquisition ..  
Comcast merger didn't go through",Who would buy EA ?,1.0,2022-07-23 19:02:11
728,1658525932,w5m6n6,1,"This week was an interesting one. The bulls were pretty clearly in control all week yet we only secured a 2.5% green week. The most interesting thing though is that this is the first week before FOMC that has been green since 2021‚Ä¶ Almost every week before FOMC has been very red (average is -2 to -5%). 

Speaking of FOMC week (recommend you read my TA I just posted on that too‚Ä¶ ) but two of the last four FOMC Mondays/ Tuesdays were red (averaging -1.2% for the reds Mondays/ Tuesday) and averaging +0.6% for the green Mondays/ tuesdays). It should be noted that the reddest Monday/ Tuesday before FOMC was this last meeting in June where we dropped a total of 4.2% over two days. 

Lets start with SPY then move onto ES as this week we are actually seeing some differences that present two different cases for next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/ymki7h4ev6d91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51b01064e7fe20880905e907eb9aafa5bdf78346

The chart actually has quite a few things to keep an eye on.

Rising wedge- Today you see the rising wedges support line was broken. Technically it was broken yesterday but because we still had a green day it was worth noting a possible new support could have built. Plus the support for this rising wedge on the 15minute had not been broken yet. Now that we have broken this support it should be assumed a retracement back down is coming as this is a bearish reversal pattern. 

Double top- We actually put in a perfect double top on the daily today with resistance now being at 398.9. This should be seen as a major resistance going forward. This level has been hit time and time again. 

401.44 Gap- today we chipped away at the 401.55 gap dropping it from a $2.6 gap to a $1.29 gap. There is actually a case to be made though that SPY is going to build support here and consolidate sideways (much like we did in April and June) before we either fall more or make our next move up. While my personal preference is not that SPY fills this gap Monday there is a case to be made that we could pop $6.5 fill it really quick and then start our sell off. Would be a nice 1.6% pop on Monday. I suppose the case could be made that we fill it and consolidate here before FOMC Wednesday instead of seeing a true sell off. 

378.57 to 380.54 gap- we still have this about $3 gap left down below and I would be very surprised to not see it filled this week. Overall I actually suspect this to be filled by Tuesday EOD its about a 4.5% drop from here. At minimum if they really are planning to leave this unfilled I suspect them to cut that gap in half. 

369.38 to 370.18 gap- this 80 cent gap still exists and lives rent free in SPYs head‚Ä¶ overall this one being under $1 while statistically speaking it SHOULD fill I would not be surprised if this one did not fill.

Symmetrical triangle- looking at this daily you can see we have a symmetrical triangle forming with the green dotted being resistance and the blue dotted being support. WE should look to see now that resistance has been made a dip back to retest support. 

Daily 50ema- this was the first week that SPY has broken above the daily 50ema since April. Despite trading beneath it today and threatening to close below it today the bulls bounced it enough to close above it‚Ä¶ I like to say when an EMA is broken like this that it is a hint of what to come. Had this been true support I would have liked to seen a bounce off of it and not trade beneath it the way we did. My suspicion is that we see this broke and we test the daily 8 and 20ema this week ahead. 

https://preview.redd.it/fupr38dfv6d91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278f05a0a0de6752ece85eaf3f1ad47be14b1260

The weekly chart I would call bullish but weak. Today we saw that 400 level retested and a pretty solid resistance rejection as you can see. After that 400 test we saw a pretty violent sell off and rejection further down. This is the first time the weekly candle has closed above the weekly 8ema since the week of April 5th. 

Overall you can see we have actually started a very mild bull channel upwards. The support for that next week that is crucial to hold is 389.4. 

Bull and bear wise for SPY‚Ä¶ I see far more reason to be bearish then I do bullish right now. I would be vey surprised to see the markets not begin to panic at all before FOMC. To go into FOMC bullish or even neutral with no sell off would be hella surprising. The only case I can have be made for that is that everyone expects 75bps hike and now that big tech is laying people off they are going to look to see if the feds actually pause rate hikes after this one. That or we truly are setting up for one hell of a bloody week with big tech earnings, FOMC and GDP Thursday. 

Bulls-

Bulls are going to want to see this 395 support level hold on Monday and from there they have a lot of resistance to break through to fill the gap before FOMC and try to be in the 400s before FOMC on Wednesday. 

389.9 -&gt; 401.4 (gap fill and break resistance line) -&gt; 405.4 -&gt; 409.5 -&gt; 412

Bears-

Bears are going to want to break down that 395 support and break through the daily 50ema without question. Once the daily 50ema is closed under they will look to drop this back under the daily 8 and 20ema and prevent the 8ema from crossing above the 50ema. 

395 -&gt; 392.3 -&gt; 388.7 -&gt; 385.3 -&gt; 382.1 -&gt; 378.8 (gap fill) -&gt; 376.8 (support line)

ES futures daily chart is a little different. 

As you can see the bulls actually held it above the rising wedges support when they prevented the end of day sell off. The wedge is pretty much reached its peak right now though and we are about as close to a decision without having it as we can possible be. So lets talk about the daily ES.

Rising wedge- this morning when we broke out to 4016 we actually DID break the resistance line of the rising wedge. It was not by much but it did very slightly wick through resistance. However, due to the immediate rejection we could have had a fake breakout. This pattern will play out Monday with either 3978 support breaking or 4005 resistance breaking. Being that 4005 has been a key resistance I would be surprised to see a breakout to the upside

Symmetrical triangle- this uses the blue dotted support and red dotted resistance line. As I had mentioned the red dotted resistance was broken but its possible it‚Äôs a fake breakout. If we start breaking down this week we will look for support between 3775 and 3790 on the blue dotted line depending on the intensity of the drop. If we were to see the rising wedge hold and see the red dotted line broken at 4005 then we are actually going to be targeting 4100-4175 next week. 

Daily 50ema- much like SPY I mentioned about they closed it over the 50ema today just barely at the end. Bears will want to break that down next week while bulls defend it again. 

https://preview.redd.it/9k9jm6fhv6d91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4272cbb6ef2996a58f5f839896251905d074a965

Now the futures weekly is looking similar to SPY but almost more bullish to me. We are seeing that we closed above that key 3905 resistance line. That has been a magnet for the last 4 weeks and we finally were able to close away from it. 

As you can see we have that blue dotted mild bull channel formed here too. We will keep a close eye on that this week and weeks to come. I am seeing that SPY weekly did fail to break out above the 100ema despite having the bullish close over the weekly 8ema for first time since the week of March 28th. 

When I look at the ES daily/ weekly chart I actually want to be more bullish than I do with SPY. It actually attempted to break out upwards from resistance of the symmetrical triangle before being smacked down. In addition I have been saying I truly think the bottom is in and if the bottom is truly in then this slow mild bull channel would be the perfect mild recovery trajectory. 

There is no doubt who was in control this week and that was the bulls. Even the VIX on this pretty good sell off SPY had managed to close at 23. The VIX made a lower low despite a pretty big red day for SPY. 

If I was looking at this chart right here and I didn‚Äôt have FOMC to worry about and didn‚Äôt have earnings to worry about I would be saying lets load some calls for next week cause shes finna rip and that this dip was the buying opportunity. However, we have to even in a macro trend look at the micro trend. 

I wont lie when I started writing this TA I was full bear for next week. But the more I look really hard into things, adjust things for how the day finished out im struggling not feeling bullish next week. Had the bears been able to break us down close to 392/ 3920 or below EOD then I would be hella bearish but im slightly struggling being bearish more then knowing FOMC usually is a drop in market due to fear. 

I still do see now looking at this a case for that gap fill Monday or Tuesday. But the unknown of course is going to be FOMC‚Ä¶ is markets truly already numb and priced in the 75bps hike and we are just going to rally or at least range into FOMC? I mean I suppose its possible. 

I recommend you read my FOMC dd/ta I posted but I mention playing calls in there at 235pm and being careful of a January FOMC when we dump‚Ä¶ if market is truly going to go into FOMC with a bullish mentality that everything is fine and we have nothing to worry about then we do need to be very careful with what we do on that FOMC trade. IF we get truly something in left field and JPOW is even slightly hawkish we are about to see the mega dumps of mega dumps. I also think with GDP the next day we are going to aggressive dump Thursday.

Now apple is an interesting chart. I missed the massive breakout that apple was going on and truly that handicapped me this week as I missed the bullish tech momentum that Apple hinted at in early July. 

Rising wedge- apple is trading within two potential rising wedges. There is the solid black support line which puts support close to 150.5 to 152. This support has held up nicely since June 30th that‚Äôs nearly a month long bull support line on Apple. Resistance wise we have the first one using todays candle the black dotted which shows 156.5 as resistance for Monday and then we have the solid black resistance line that actually shows Apple could break out of its grey bear channel. 

Grey bear channel- this channel resistance has not been tested since the April bull run. We are closer to it now then we have been since then. This week we have potential to not only test resistance but also to break resistance if Apple can see 158. 159.5 for 100% confirmation. However, a rejection here would play the bearish thesis out for SPY and the overall markets. This 158 rejection also would allow SPY to fill its 401.5 gap. 

Daily 200ema- this is the first time we have seen Apple close a full candle over the 200ema since May 4th (ironically that was FOMC day). 

Daily double top- apple put in a pretty convincing double top at 155.5 today and that will prove to be a key level for bulls to retake and for bears to defend. 

EMAs- we now have the daily 20ema crossed over the 50ema for the first time since April 22nd (very bullish), and we have the daily 8 ema threatening to cross over the 100ema which would be an incredibly bullish move. Bulls need to defend that 200ema with their lives next week. 

Earnings- this is actually why I am currently in a 7dte 152.5P for next week. In April the 7day proceeding earnings on the 28th saw a 10% drop and 9% drop. With the big SNAP miss and overall slowing of hiring announced this week and what not I am playing this that we should see further drop Monday Tuesday and Wednesday leading to the Thursday Earnings. This would target 138-140. I personally do not think it dips that low but I am eyeing support around 147. 

https://preview.redd.it/fme7fwojv6d91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01bc88bcaf07484f86223333d4001b35bdbef914

The Apple weekly chart actually is looking hella bullish right now. 

Black dotted bull channel- that we have held despite its tightness for 6 weeks now‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs some significant movement green‚Ä¶ Support for this remains at 152.3 next week. IF that level breaks we should suspect downside closer to 140-145. If bulls defend 152.3 we have upside potential of 167 based on the black dotted channel. 

Red dotted bear channel- this channel shows that if bulls hold onto support of the black bull channel and if earnings are good this week we could be seeing 164 tested. This 164 and red dotted resistance line is very important because it shows that we are 100% out of the bear channels and will look to tackle the last resistance line at 175. The thing to know is that Apple unlike most charts (SPY/ QQQ) didn‚Äôt have the straight drop it sideways burned and in March had such an aggressive recovery it nearly retouched ATHs. 

Blue dotted bear channel- this one is a key level for bulls to break through. It rides at 156.2 which is the level Apples weekly rejected at this week. If we break through that there is a lot of green ahead of us. If we reject there and reconfirm the bear channel then we are starting to think about that support line down in the low 100s again. 

Overall I see a big case for bulls the more im diving into this. If it was not for FOMC I would be 100% bullish next week. Is FOMC enough reason to not be bullish though? Historically speaking yes it is. As you can see every week this year before FOMC has been red in preparation and 50% of the time SPY is red the two days before FOMC. Once we get FOMC, GDP and Earnings outta the way then we can follow the chart and not the events. 

NOTE- I am out of town Monday and Tuesday with the family at the beach‚Ä¶ no TA those days and no trading those days. I will be back in the saddle Wednesday though for FOMC of course!

10% challenge-

Overall this was a red week for me. I had a great Monday (broke my 5 week long red Monday streak which is great‚Ä¶ also broke my red Friday streak too) but I unfortunately could not get on board with the bull thesis this week and that was my downfall. I was too bearish with FOMC coming up and expecting a sell off that I missed out on big gains. That was a bias I gave myself based on previous data. 

I also got greedy at times too and didn‚Äôt trust the trend. This is actually the best trends I have seen in months on SPY. We pretty much had five days this week that once the morning bullshit was done we were locked into a solid trend that was easy to follow and maximum gains were able to be achieved. OF course this market has turned most of us into scalpers so its hard to trust anything over 10-15% gains. 

This week ALMOST makes me believe in trusting the trend. And that just because a candle retraces slightly doesn‚Äôt mean we have to exit. If this is truly the new market and we truly put a bottom in‚Ä¶ we just might be seeing some normalcy return. 

The biggest thing for me next week is to not fight the trend and also no matter what I THINK its going to do we trust the trend in front of us. I wont miss out on any rallies just because I don‚Äôt believe it anymore.

I opened this VERY small swing for next weeks earnings. I expect a sell off into earnings so I will be looking to close this Monday or Tuesday depending on what happens. However, upon writing this TA I am not as confident in this position as I was when I opened it and Apple and SPY looked like an EOD sell off was coming. 

I don‚Äôt plan to trade at all Monday or Tuesday. I might make a small swing Monday night depending on what I see.

With 2y/10y being inverted for two weeks with increasing gap every day and even 2y/30y being inverted, oil and commodities crashing, and more and more lay offs happening, recession fear will most likely be on the rise again.

SPY has reached the upper channel that stopped it for a week and made it drop over 10 percent one month ago. I thought that SPY might try to fill the gap up to 401 that appeared one month ago, but it doesn't look like there's enough volume to fill it.

[Volume on SPY just gets lower and lower.](https://preview.redd.it/tdmqwodpb3d91.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64dc6dc852033ce3738b856c3f71787f7f109779)

QQQ has reached the channel top of the beginning of the bear market. Tech has been the main driver of this bear market rally, and then especially Apple. My guess would be that many are relocating their money into more safe tech stocks that will handle a recession better, and Apple is most likely one of the most strong contenders that will recover quickly. Considering Apple is the biggest stock in both S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, it moves the entire index by itself.

[QQQ has managed to fill the gap earlier.](https://preview.redd.it/95pjyehqb3d91.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a05d4dd24762707264d953356ca0a21981186e)

Apple is dragging the entire market around, but has now reached the level where it previously bounced off resistance. Volume on Apple is getting lower and lower, and it has also reached the upper part of its bear rally channel.

[Apple more or less driving the entire market, as its a safe haven blue chip among tech stocks and less likely to crash as much as the others and recover more quickly](https://preview.redd.it/pwrmmddrb3d91.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e271289d9de1eba9640a674748b3d5eba5685038)

So considering the fear the coming week and the increasing volatility, with my guess that Apple won't be around to drive the bear market rally as much this time around, I think there's a good chance of a solid downturn, and there might even be enough catalysts around next week to cause a ten percent drop like one month ago, or even more considering how little volume and buyers there are around during holidays.

I've got August 19th puts, as I think the market will drop during next week, probably rally on FOMC day like always, and then drop again afterwards. Might hold through FOMC though as I think Powell might be pretty hawkish during his speech, considering the stagnating and even still increasing inflation and still relatively strong job market, though usually real economy lags 6-9 months after markets and lay offs probably start properly during fall, only tech has been early in lay offs since they're hit more by rate hikes.",Technical analysis of bear market,1.0,2022-07-22 10:10:47

This was VERY interesting timing as markets had already saw a very aggressive morning rejection and was starting a dump. The new came out and the sell pressure hit some pretty high levels however, we managed to find support at that 391.5 to 392 range yet again and went on for a pretty impressive $7.21 run.

Something extremely interesting about this week before FOMC is that this is the first week since the November 2021 FOMC meeting that SPY has had a green week proceeding the FOMC meeting. So that‚Äôs only 1 other time in the last 6 meetings we have seen that‚Ä¶ interesting to say the least. This is also the lowest the VIX has been the week before FOMC since January. 

What does this mean? I am not sure‚Ä¶ but the sentiment right now is clearly very bullish but I think that we are about to see this change. The steam has been slowly fading.

Kind of an interesting case here on the daily. At open today we had already broken the week+ long support line. This means that the rising wedge you see what and is broken. So that SHOULD be a sign of a drop that is coming. I am looking at that red resistance line and the last 4 candles on spy have hit it‚Ä¶ today came very close to hitting it but did not have enough momentum to hit its 400 target. 

This candle is a hammer candle on paper which could signal a top. 

https://preview.redd.it/s4j32oxkizc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5827fdfa1467e78f8c99430e21c05defc436c976

The SPY weekly did break its resistance line which is bullish, however, its fallen short of its 400 resistance line.

ES futures perfectly rejected the 4005 resistance line. We have not however, seen ES futures break down out of its rising wedge but we are seeing that tomorrow and overnight this 4005 resistance level is going to be key. My expectations is ES will retest 4005 perhaps even the red dotted line at 4015 before it rejects and falls out of the rising wedge with support at 3945. 

https://preview.redd.it/byfa2j6mizc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5390af64a18be0ab71302f85264dd488bd29bd6

I wanted to draw some attention to Apples Daily chart. Apple has been in my opinion carrying this whole last month of movement upward. Today we saw a confirmed hammer candle on the daily and the last time we had a candle like this was May 17th which led to a massive gap down and a massive red day. You can see the last two days on Apple the volume has significantly dropped off which tells me that the buying momentum has faded and we should and could be seeing the top put in right now. 

Bull case- 

Despite a spotty morning we were able to back test 392.3 support and make it through the morning Biden Covid news. Despite the rising wedge breaking we are still making higher highs and higher lows since July 14th. Markets are still quickly pricing in all news. The weekly just saw a major resistance line broken and now with the June 9th gap only $2.60 away it is a natural expectation that this will be filled tomorrow as it is within reach. The bulls have clearly been in control all week with every dip being a CALL buying opportunity. 

Bulls will look to gap fill 401.5 and break through resistance at 402.4. From there it looks to continue its bullish momentum as we head into next week where bulls will look to reach the top of the rising wedge at 415 before FOMC on Wednesday. 

Bear case (this is where im leaning)-

This is the first earnings that really has shaken up the market. Now SNAPCHAT does not have a huge stake in the market BUT you can see everyone is being hit by it now. A little odd thing is that last earnings seasons SNAP report on April 21st and that was what proceeded a major sell off going into FOMC the next week‚Ä¶ April 21st was the top after SNAP reports and today is looking to be the top after SNAP reported and FOMC next week‚Ä¶ coincidence? Probably‚Ä¶ but weird‚Ä¶ okay back to TA‚Ä¶

Despite the bullish momentum today we saw that the support line that has been carrying spy fell today. We have now broken out of the rising wedge and that naturally should signal a top. The bulls for two days straight now have had an opportunity to reach 401.5 to gap fill yet have failed time and time again. Intraday the last two days we have seen some pretty heavy sell offs and sell pressure, however, at this momentum for now its been eaten up by the bulls.

With this hammer candle on Apple and Spy and an overall decrease in the volume on SPY, with 4 of the last 5 days being green (3 green in a row) and the weekend ahead it is a natural expectation that we see a red day tomorrow. With the weekend ahead and snap now missing earnings hugely and not giving guidance we should see people start to position themselves for the rest of big tech next week and FOMC next week. 

Bears will look to break down that 

If by some miracle the bulls can keep this momentum up tomorrow and they can take this to the gap fill and even that 403 level I mentioned I would be surprised. 392.5 and attempt to close SPY back under the daily 8ema which is currently at 389.5. A closure back under the daily 50 and 8ema would be a very bearish turn for the markets and would give a nice hint of bearishness heading into FOMC next week. 

10% challenge-

Today I did not make any day trades. My expectations were a range day and this morning movement was anything but normal. We had once again some major 0.5% candles and saw at times Spy moving up and down but 50 cents at a time. When the Biden covid news hit I was ready to take a short but knew that this could be the over reaction. Despite increasing sell pressure I waited and it paid off. Around 2pm when I saw how strong 397.3 resistance was holding up I did scale into a 1dte and 6dte put position. I had plans to scale in further EOD but with us so close to the gap fill I wanted to be cautious and knew that theta would eat me up overnight either way. 

My plan is to see where we open the 1dte has a break even (currently with no expected IV pump on a dump) of 394. There is a pretty big case that we could see a -1% or lower opening. With the dump right at close my average down only brought my breakeven close by $1 so the risk to reward was not there for me. If we open green and look to be going for gap fill I will consider averaging down there if I suspect an EOD sell off. If we open big red I will most likely just let it ride as If we are red I suspect a bigger sell off. 

The 6dte I wanted to scale into and hold this till Tuesday night. I suspect that we are going to see a pretty large sell off tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday especially. I will look to average down if we gap fill this otherwise I will consider adding to this in the morning. I most likely will take profits EOD and then open a new position for next week depending on what tomorrow brings. This 6dte has about the same breakeven without pump near 394.5. 

Not going to lie after a rough week of trading for me it felt kind of nice not playing anything and just watching it. The momentum was spotty at times. I never felt like the bulls had me convinced we were going to run like that EOD. I also have not been a fan of trading over the probable IV highs/ lows and we once again hit the improbable IV high.

People love to talk about the **""tight job market""** and how unemployment rates are still incredibly low. Don't expect that to last. It won't. As JPOW continues to hike up interest rates, the death spiral will start. More and more companies will have mass layoffs. Unemployment rate will go up higher than most people will expect. People who can't even imagine losing their jobs will lose their jobs. Just like these 8000 salaried Ford employees didn't expect to lose their jobs but they did anyway.

What does this mean for regular everyday Americans. Well, apart from the fact that finding a job will become harder than it is now, the housing market may collapse as well. If millions of Americans are laid off, then you can't expect them to continue making their monthly mortgage payments. Foreclosures will rise sharply.

736,1658374782,w46aow,1," So what kind of coked out adderall overdose made me go bold with this prediction of imminent doom when the market has been doing uppies all week? It's pretty simple. Next Wednesday is FOMC where we're either going to get a .75bp rate hike, in which case the market does its usual rocket ship after the meeting, or we get a surprise 1.00bp hike and things probably tank after the meeting. Then on Thursday we have the Q2 GDP numbers come out confirming we're officially in a recession. (a fact I called last October btw, it just took a couple months for the data to catch up) The real action though is in the Thursday after hours Earnings Reports. Specifically, the ERs for two of the biggest companies on the planet, both of which I expect to fail spectacularly.

Apple and Amazon.

Just in general I think both of these stocks are wildly overvalued (I have a fair price target of $20-25 on AMZN and $50 on AAPL) Amazon has a PE of 60, which is so absurd on multiple levels that I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's dumb. Apple has a PE of 25, which, again, is too high.

I think both companies are going to get absolutely annihilated on ER, and when they do, they'll drag the entire market down with them. Now, why I am I so sure both companies will have bad ERs?

For Amazon, it's really easy, their current post Bezos leadership is actually a bunch of ferrets piled on top of each other in trenchcoats, they wildly overexpanded during the pandemic, and as people go outside again, they're not loading up on orders. Also, Prime Day was a bust, and AWS continues to no longer enjoy exclusive rights to the cloud services space as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and more expand into it.

For Apple, they're basically in the same situation as Amazon was last ER, where they had a complete dumpster fire of an ER previously, but papered over it with nonsense - in Apple's case that was refusing to provide guidance for their #1 market and home of 100% of their assemblies - China.

[This kind of price action for bear market rallies i had in my mind: Post Cpi rally, Pre Fomc fall &amp; Post Gdp rally then fall and one last final rally in august.](https://preview.redd.it/1tulukepboc91.png?width=1751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aecf0081c0c3a9c835c5ce84cfaa2fcb6b6ff8a0)

[I told you first local bottom would be September 20-21 and then we shall see from there whats next.](https://preview.redd.it/c0qr8rzkcoc91.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=422060ac1a1ea8336e29940da19c97ad94baf1cf)

&amp;#x200B;

**After ( Around July 4 ) :**

But after that post by Atlanta Fed of -2.1% Q2 Gdp prediction i kind of got scared guys. And add the Bloomberg estimate of 8.8% inflation ( which by the way came 9.1% ) scared the heck out of me. Hence my avid readers know very well i flip flopped and told you all to sell ofc not in loss but above 2% from June 15 bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So was i right or was i wrong ? And most importantly what mistake did i made leading up to that. ( It's very important to learn from your mistakes )**

&amp;#x200B;

Let me answer the first part was i right or wrong. I think i was wrong because i told you to not ride this rally and sell everything with just 2% profit in index. Thereby you guys missed the phenomenal gains that you were going to have.

So guys again sorry about that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So now let's address how did i made this mistake. Well i think it has got to be with Cpi, rate hike and Gdp right. Lets discuss this in detail?** 

&amp;#x200B;

What i thought :

I was under the impression that Cpi will come higher than 8.8% which many of you know we were discussing in comments section and hence market will try pricing 100bps beforehand and sell off. But eventually we will go up because we always do after Fomc ( reason being market prices things before if its exp or below exp ) But this time we had Gdp data too. If it came -ve we will sell off. So it was like these theories were contradicting itself and playing devil's advocate with each other. Hence i made a decision that you guys should sell and think about shorting rather than longing.

&amp;#x200B;

What actually happened :

&amp;#x200B;

[July commodity fell and also 5yr break evens have now returned to October 2021 levels by bond market traders](https://preview.redd.it/o1150aaxioc91.png?width=1912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44d45eacd848efc378e9ac3b8216d715c128ab9c)

&amp;#x200B;

But what happened was the commodity guys. These things like Oil, Metals ( Gold, Dr copper ) started selling off. This told the market okay don't get scared about Cpi because these numbers are probably from June where everything was high. But come August Cpi numbers it shall be low because in July we started falling in commodity prices. Hence the inflation will be peaked already in July Cpi numbers from June data. So this +ve feedback led to another positive feedback that the Fed will not hike by 100bps. Meaning we don't need to go down to price this extra 100bps. Waller and Mester then confirmed that we will only do 75bps. So you got another +ve feedback. Now this Gdp guys. This stupid Gdp. Many of the people are now suggesting that it will come +ve. Only the Atlanta Fed thinks it will be negative. So you got hit by triple +ve feedback. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Gdp forecast](https://preview.redd.it/zsvbz8r9hoc91.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f814a668bd4f0bca0f4be2168c9bbb665f96730b)

&amp;#x200B;

Note : I am not taking earnings right as of now cause our analysis was based on three factor world of Inflation, Fomc rate hike and Gdp numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

So i think now you guys must be thinking okay you were wrong what are you trying to prove here. Also why are we reading your post. Where the hell is Tl dr.

&amp;#x200B;

# So here's the Tl;dr :

**Technical Analysis is God whereas Fundamental Analysis is sh9t tbh. XD**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So we have now kinda established three things :

A : I am wrong and never should have flip flopped.

B : The thought process about why this rally is going on.

C : You guys have no sense of humor honestly. In my last post i wrote in disclaimer it didn't mean anything and yet you guys down-voted it like hell. I told you guys i was away busy settling things xD

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Conclusion :**

Well whatever thought process i must have had there is no denying that stock market is a voting machine in short term. So please guys don't get lost by these experts telling you that we have finally bottomed and now are going up and everything is A-okay. Guys it not. We are in so much trouble that i have to write another post to make up for it. ( My next post title : What is wrong with the markets )

&amp;#x200B;

But in general i would advise you all to sit on sidelines and wait for this bear market rally to be over which i'm pretty confident it will somewhere b/w last week of July to first week of August. After that we fall hard. How hard we talked about it in recession pricing calculations till September 20. But these things will only happen if the market of S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq close a single candle below 200wMA or 233wEMA. Allow me to demonstrate it with charts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Focus : We have to understand the top of this bear market rally and the price where it will go. I have already given you the range of dates. Lets see this out in next posts or check out my twitter. Also i will be providing the tools that you need to short this market down right out. It not always your SQQQ or SPXU or SARK.**

**Teaser for my next post :**

&amp;#x200B;

The things we will be discussing what is fundamentally wrong with the economy and how we are viewing things.

\- We think inflation will go down. But what if owner equivalent cancels the down move by commodities out. It lags by 3m and has most % wattage in Cpi. Also we have wage price inflation issue.

\- Housing bubble pops and everything drops could easily happen.

\- To combat 9.1% inflation Fed cannot win by 3.4% as predicted by Fed funds future. Once it predicts 5% all hell will break loose coz it will mean regime change. The next 40yr bond cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Unemployment hasn't even ticked up yet.

\- 52w t-bill is trading higher than 10yr bonds. This mean long term is telling you okay \_\_\_\_\_\_ recession whereas short term is telling you you've got months not years for the massive crash of vix 40+.

&amp;#x200B;

\- This \_\_\_\_\_ is like very high level thing for macro traders. Currently market thinks its gonna be deflationary recession but i think its gonna be stagflationary one. Reason : Fed will try to fight inflation causing disinflation first which will rally the markets but soon they will realize inflation is way sticky and un-anchored because supply chains takes decade to recover. So from Q4 we could see that double digit inflation journey. Now it goes past 15% like 1970-80 remains the case to be seen. Also we will then have to worry about getting volckered. Meaning no bonds, metals, stocks, t-bill will save you. You're gonna get wrecked plain as simple except you give your stimulus back to government by parking your money with Fed in rrp.

\- We will study this bull whip effect that will be causing this disinflation first.

\- Fed inversion of curves of Us02y-Us03m and Us10y-Us03m.

\- Earnings recession and the worry of Tesla and Apple heavy weights going down making people feel like Sell Sell Sell Sell. Ah get me out.

\- At last i would say if we indeed are following my bear market rally prediction of 2008 here's the price level in spx 500 comparing that on daily. If i wanna bet on resistance it would be $4100-4200. Don't forget i have given you dates and time period before already.

Bulls ended up protecting the gap. SPY gapped up and didn‚Äôt look back - leaving bears in the dust - and closed at 392.27 (also high of day). I did think that we would see a technical bounce and then continue downwards - but that didn‚Äôt happen today!

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

US stocks surged in a broad-based rally as investors assessed the earnings outlook and speculation grew that markets were on the verge of bottoming out.

The S&amp;P 500 defied the late-day reversal that has been a hallmark of this volatile market, closing near session highs and posting its biggest one-day gain since June 24th as all 11 industry groups advanced. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 outperformed major benchmarks, finishing 3.1% higher, with megacaps Apple and Google recouping losses from Monday.

With the possibility of earnings disappointment baked into markets, any positive surprises may result in outsized gains. According to the latest Bank of America Monthly Fund Manager Survey, investors are on high alert for signs that high inflation and monetary tightening are squeezing consumers and employment, with allocation to stocks plunging to levels last seen in October 2008 and exposure to cash surging to the highest since 2001.

## Where are we on the Chart?

SPY broke out of the triangle to the upside üò≤. Spy does have a gap to fill that may act as resistance (395.77 - 401.45) so keep an eye on those levels.

https://preview.redd.it/9k7js36iolc91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3522abb7e68d4b073d9687995a197a97e38d7a8a

If SPY can fill that gap and establish support, it has an opportunity to run. Here are some additional upside targets to note. If SPY finds strong resistance, I expect another test at 391.05 and then, possibly 380-379.

* Gap fill: 395.77 - 401.45
* Upside targets: 409.87 - 417.44; 426.64
* Short term support: 391.05
* Minor support: 391.05
* Major support: 380.54 - 379.05

743,1658265641,w33way,1,"Note- no AMD TA tonight as im gonna be continuing to focus on SPY now that we are finally getting some trendy days and hopefully they are gonna make it play nicely with us‚Ä¶

The bulls are back in town? Wow what an unbelievable day to actual watch.

Let me get this straight‚Ä¶ Yesterday 389 was like some massive wall of resistance that was nearly impossible to break through and then we proceeded to have a $8+ sell off (some will argue fueled by apple news) but now all of a sudden‚Ä¶ we are back to bull town and just have a massive $10.32 green day? Am I understanding that correctly? 

https://preview.redd.it/x108a69bdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175faa3511afd8efed68c3ccd2e3ed85f1147a7f

The daily turned out to be hella bullish and despite a VERY good chance to close under that KEY 390.2 resistance it decided to push higher EOD and hold for a bullish close. 

Couple big things to note here‚Ä¶. 

1. We broke through the tan downward channel resistance this resistance dates all the way back to April‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs a huge break 

2. We broke through and CLOSED a candle over the 390.2 purple sideways channel resistance for the first time since June 10th.

3. We also closed a FULL candle over the daily 8 and 20ema for the first time since June 6th. 

https://preview.redd.it/39bye3bcdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39a8fe36ee8528735e0cb3339d8faf466adec18

So here is our updated Daily chart‚Ä¶ what do you see? 

I see a MASSIVE symmetrical triangle breakout/ break down pattern forming‚Ä¶ we just bounced off support when we hit 371 and now it looks like we will go test resistance which will be near 402 with this current trajectory. Why is 402 significant? Well there is a massive gap left on the daily that dates back to June from 395.78 to 401.44. 

Lets take a look at the weekly now‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/rlkxscxddlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f4a83aa5cb7a62762e32adf7c58ac98b1101cf2

I mentioned earlier in the week the descending triangle was broken but we do have a new one we are working on right now. The interesting thing about the weekly is that this is the first time since June 6th that we have seen SPY trend over the weekly 8ema. We have cleared a crucial resistance of 389 on the weekly chat and I will be looking for 397 this week and 410-415 next week if this momentum keeps up. 

Key support for bulls tomorrow is now that 388.9 and 390.2 level. If it happens to get back tested it will be crucial that they hold it. But solidifying that support would lead to more bullish upside. However, the current support line shows that we will hold above 390.5. Bulls will be targeting 397.4 minimum tomorrow and closer to 401.6 for a true gap fill. It has been Since May 26th and May 27th that we have gotten back to back 2%+ green days. I am curious to see if we get that type of pop again tomorrow. 

Bears are going to look to break down that 390.5 support line that‚Äôs we have been trending on since the 371 support test. If they break that down they will want to see 382 support broken. 

Looking at this daily chart I was correct yesterday when I said I didn‚Äôt feel like that red candle was a true reversal candle‚Ä¶ granted I didn‚Äôt feel like we would hit that sort of green today and I really didn‚Äôt think we would break 390.2. 

https://preview.redd.it/lgi1kajedlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da02a1f210232cac49d78eecfdbfdb8c0da40c1

Futures is looking fairly similar to SPY.. it broke its sideways purple channel and yesterday it broke the same resistance line that SPY broke intraday today‚Ä¶ chart wise it does appear ES is proceeding what SPY is going to do. 

https://preview.redd.it/0v219s5hdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ae7d4e02e1c0b87ea617d90b3d3f81352a8082b

Futures with a pretty clear trend also just like SPY. Symmetrical breakout triangle with support hit just on July 14th at 3724. Es closed a candle over 3920 for the first time since June 9th which is very bullish. I am also seeing that intraday today ES tested its daily 50ema for the first time since June 3rd. I will be watching Futures closely over night to see how it interacts with 3950. 

Bull levels to watch- 3950 √† 4000 √† 4090.

Current bull channel resistance for a break out is at 4010.

Bear levels to watch ‚Äì 3920 √† 3875 (support line for this bull run) √† 3827. 

If bulls can keep this momentum up and they can close this over the daily 50ema tomorrow of 3850 that is going to lead to some extremely bullish momentum for the end of the week and next week. However, if bears finally step back in tomorrow and reject the 50ema we might see a larger break down and back test that 3875 support which is that fails I believe we are on the path back to 3827. 

https://preview.redd.it/f2b771fidlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ff58fd7fb3ca932f61ff8633d083d7574194d5

The ES futures weekly I am very curious where we are going to go here‚Ä¶ We still have a descending wedge we are watching and looking to see that broken at the 3970 level. We are also seeing us trade over the weekly 8ema for the first time since early June. Overall you can see we have 3 major levels on ES futures right now. The bottom level is 3675, the middle level is 3905 and the upper level (our current upside target) is 4160. 

Right now we have clearly bounced off the bottom 3675 level and after what looks like 4 weeks of consolidation bouncing off this 3905 level‚Ä¶ we look ready to breakout to the upside.

And then we have the VIX‚Ä¶ this thing I just can not figure out. SPY just put in nearly a 3% green day and it acted like we just chopped at 0% all day long. The VIX essentially reacted the exact same to a -2% drop as it did a 2%+ rip. What does that mean exactly? Well I am still unsure on this to be honest. On one hand I feel the market is pretty numb to all news and I have mentioned a few times now that the 200weekly ema bounce at 363 COULD have been bottom and the vix is going to slowly unwind down. On the otherhand I feel like we are getting such wild volumes right now (watching VOLD and VOLSPD intraday) that its just trumping anything the VIX wants to do. Bullish? Or bearish? Im still unsure as next week is still going to be a hell of a big potential shit storm with I believe its 70% of SPYs earnings reporting this or next week, FOMC, and GDP‚Ä¶

10% Challenge-

Today was a tough day for me. I had a massive struggle believing in this bull day and believing we would see this strong of a bull day. For the last pretty much month we have been living in chop land. And I have relied heavily on the improbable/ probable highs and lows of the day based on IV (this is a think or swim indicator you can add to your chart). For about the last month (really until this last week) we have seen the Probable lows/ highs act as walls and they have been great levels to scalp reversals and to scalp momentum from and to. Today we hit 388 which was the probable IV low of the day and that was also resistance from yesterday. We chopped at 389.7 resistance for almost 2 hours before we finally pushed higher and we broke the improbable high of day of 391.4 around 145pm. From there we just kept rejecting and retesting this support level. I was able to get in two nice scalps here a call and a put at this level. Power hour I decided I was going to play the reversal off of 392.7 and I was expecting us being nearly $1.5 over the improbable high that we would see a reversal and a dump EOD. Of course that is not what happened. Took a hard loss on that scalp there but I still got 3 days to turn this week around to green. 

My current struggle is that for the last month‚Ä¶ really the last 6 months now‚Ä¶ we have experience this WILD reversal swings and WILD 1-2% dumps. As much as I would LOVE spy to return to a consistent market and trend I am very hesitant to expect such things from it. With the VIX seemingly plateaued at this 24-25 level the last few days everything has been volume driven. Watching VOLD and VOLSPD end of day today despite them running non stop bull all day today they really broke out EOD and drove SPY even higher. 

Perhaps we are getting back to a market where we can trust the trend and actually rely on the 8ema for support and resistance. Perhaps we‚Ä¶ for now‚Ä¶ are past these massive reversal and massive swings. I will be watching intraday tomorrow to see if we are getting back to levels where we can trust a play to run for the day instead of closing it with a quick scalp. But my lesson the last two or three days has been to trust the volume not the VIX.

I played a OTM Netflix (very small lotto) play today I was tempted to and should have closed it EOD but didn‚Äôt. Being that Netflix is up 7.5% right now im pretty sure she gonna be nothing at open. The guidance call on Netflix will be very interesting. But the expected move at 14%+ for Netflix today so either way unless we massively dump this was a losing trade. My one and only earnings play. 

After seeing all the bullish momentum the last two days and really the last week and the 390/ 3920 levels being broken and closed over I decided to play this call overnight. I have a feeling with Netflix beating (not that I really think they could have taken the markets down) and now with tesla tomorrow night we will get one more bull day. 

I honestly think a 401.5 gap fill is possible tomorrow‚Ä¶ it would be a 2.4% green day for SPY. I would not be surprised to see a gap up tomorrow either and a 1%+ green open for SPY. 

We left the 379.05 to 380.54 and 369.38 to 370.18 gaps down below. My thoughts are we are finally going to fill this 401.5 gap and then we can position ourselves bearishly for the next week. It‚Äôs the perfect storm‚Ä¶ bull week leading into the black swan week.

I decided to do some research for tommorow and I remember seeing a Snickers wrapper that said past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior so let's look at July 19th, 2021.

https://www.reuters.com/business/dow-futures-slide-1-virus-surge-raises-growth-worries-2021-07-19/

So July 19th last year was a bloody Monday. The Dow, S&amp;P, and Nasdaq we're all down ~2%.(2.61%, 2.04%,1.40% respectively)

Ironically this was the biggest single day drop across all the indices so far that year, despite 12 weeks of higher highs. The main reasoning behind this move was Delta variant (lol) and consumer sentiment this is a direct quote from an article from last year:  ""Retail sales grew surprisingly in June, but a measure of consumer sentiment for July showed that Americans are growing less confident about the economy."" Sound familiar?

Moving on we closed at max pain for Wednesdays options.(~$382)  Lot of regards trading options this week ig 

Now let's look at:

Apple (6.6% of SPY)
Down over 2% on the day with news of cost cutting and layoffs in the future kinda suss a week before earnings. Bulls and boomers irrational love not enough to hold this (and the market) up tommorow.
EOD PT:$142
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/18/apple-iphone-remains-in-high-demand-despite-inflation-pressure.html

Amazon (2.9% of SPY) Barely closed green on the day. Starting an expensive fight with a europoor grocery store chain or some shit and prime day was weak AF. Has same earnings release as apple and missed it's last earnings estimates so hard it's still funny all these months later. 
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/18/amazon-faces-probe-by-federal-prosecutors-osha-into-warehouse-safety.html
EOD PT: $111

Tesla (1.8% of SPY).  The most pale of the Africans Elon Musk more than likely will have his discovery request for more time before his Twitter trial denied by a Delaware judge so expect a dip on Tesla cause all this company is good for is measuring elons current popularity in the world. Earnings 7/20 after hours. Looking at price action since last earnings this shit prolly gonna drop frfr. I don't think they've sold enough cars to make significant $$$.
EOD PT: $700

748,1658176420,w29gw7,1,"So let me get this straight‚Ä¶ we had nothing but terrible news all week last week but ole Apple drops a news nugget about hiring slowing and market capitulates itself? What the actual fuck is going on around here? But to be fair it makes sense‚Ä¶. It makes sense that they would do it on a random ass day instead of when we all expected it and were all positioned for it. 

Now the question is‚Ä¶. Was this a over reaction or was this the beginning of the next big leg down? My vote? I think we bounce tomorrow and maybe once tesla reports we actually go down‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my opinion‚Ä¶ Ta wise it could go either way. 

https://preview.redd.it/fok0jak40ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28e30b1eb997165164e0ebd3f9bcd3aca5ec195

If you look at SPY and ES futures weekly chart you can see we broke out upwards from the descending wedge which should be bullish, however, they both perfectly rejected their weekly 8ema. That rejection is actually more bearish than the resistance line break out. 

https://preview.redd.it/sprxl9q50ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271a9db03de763e23746f08626cf09190fcb016f

Now the daily charts for SPY and Es futures look pretty bearish to me. On SPY we see we nearly perfectly tapped the downward tan channels resistance line and came just short of the sideways purple resistance line too. This tells me we have more to go down. If you look at the next chart below you can see we had a similar movement on April 21st and similar sized candle red on that day. We could be seeing the next big move of the market over the next month or so if this resistance rejection holds true. 

Looking at the ES futures you see that we broke the blue dotted resistance line which would be bullish but we rejected the purple channel. You can see by the blue arrows that everytime we have hit these we have reversed course. 

https://preview.redd.it/vn8d7kx60ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da2c39629dce6d99bfccd78b654229ca5cd6583

And then we have the vix‚Ä¶ it attempted to break back into that key 25.5 level today and even saw 25.91 at its peak today but overall I would still venture to say that the VIX is not onboard yet for the next leg down. The only reason im not saying its time to go heavy into some puts here or uvxy/ VIX calls is because of how the VIX reacted today‚Ä¶ I feel like it more naturally reacted today but it still didn‚Äôt quite spike and hold like we would have expected. I would and will be bearish longer term once we break through 26.7 VIX. 

I still think this could have easily been a market over reaction to the Apple news. If it was a over reaction then we will see a pop tomorrow and most likely see a green day tomorrow. Unless some more news about tech come out tomorrow there really isn‚Äôt anything until Tesla earnings Wednesday night that would really move the markets. I would be careful here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kjbg4z380ec91.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4b31fa3f1c4cb7ce18bde07fec966420437a23c

I also would be careful until this breaks back under 20k. Hoping that a picture of it wont result in my post getting removed‚Ä¶ but I think this being so green today is a big hint of whats to come. I wont be full bear thill this breaks back under 20k and holds. 

Bull case for SPY/ ES-

Despite the big sell off today we managed to close at that key 382 support. It is an adjusted close to just slightly under 382.23 which is the daily 8ema‚Ä¶ Looking at Fridays candle we do see a possible double bottom forming here at 382 and the wicks at 380.6. The VIX has not fully committed to the next drop yet and until we really see that break and fly over 26.6 we most likely are going to hold what we got. We do have to keep in mind that today could have been a true market over reaction which we have seen time and time before. It could be argued that this new was used as a chance to fill the big gap up we had overnight and that now that the gap is filled we should reverse. 

Bear case for SPY/ ES- Markets have been looking for a reason to dump and this might finally be the reason. With a resistance line rejection of two key channels this morning with a failure to break through that is bearish. This morning even before the apple new markets had SPY pinned within a &lt;$2 range for almost the whole day till the sell off started. After blowing through key 385 support and now closing under the daily 8ema and 382 support it is only natural that we could see 378.8 to fill the gap below us. We also have a fully engulfing bear candle on the daily now

Daily support for SPY- 382 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 375.1 -&gt; 370.6

Daily support for ES- 3795 -&gt; 3744 -&gt; 3671

Daily resistance for SPY- 385 -&gt; 387.3 -&gt; 390.3

Daily resistance for ES- 3915 -&gt; 4020

I feel bearish long term still but short term im not ready to be bearish enough to hold anything. I would have like it better had we stopped at 385 and formed a doji at the top on all the dailys to help with a clear reversal. This fat massive candle is not quite the reversal candle we would expect. The case for both channel resistance rejection is quite strong but we haven‚Äôt had back to back trend days in a very long time and all last week no matter what happened buyers ate everything up and we even saw that today. 

Overall I see two scenarios

1) We will hold support here at 382 and back test resistance at 385. A rejection at 385 would be a more compelling top/ reversal case than we have here. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the 388.5 resistance retested tomorrow either. If we see that then we can get not only a TRUE double top on the daily but we can also get a true tan channel resistance rejection. That would be a case for me to feel and stay feeling bearish. 

2) If we are seeing the next leg down it will start with filling the gap at 378.8. This is going to be key with what happens next. Most times a gap fills we do see a reversal so that is something we would need to keep in mind. However, if the VIX finally gets on board or we get anymore big tech bad news we might see this sell off continue. I would need VIX &gt;26.6 to believe in it though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rih5eov90ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947ffa2808f2d51357fea2154c30e4b50847a921

AMD actually looks fairly bearish here on the daily with this hanging man doji. This is the type of candle I wanted to see on ES or SPY today to really sell the top but we didn‚Äôt get it. AMD did fill their daily gap though so I would be surprised if we see a back test of support at 79.5. If that 79.5 support holds there is a pretty big case to be made for 87.2 still especially with the CHIP bill being voted on tomorrow. However, if 79.5 fails we just might see a back test of that 71.6 support. 

10% challenge-

Today was a GREAT day that I turned into a GOOD day thanks to greed and also playing it safe. All morning I hated the trend and I recognized the range super early which was great. The news broke out and I was able to get some nice plays in. I was not expecting this level of dump today and was definitely expecting this to be an over-reaction and recovery intraday especially since VIX wasn‚Äôt on board. Made some great gains and then at 2pm I made my error but going in on another 0dte OTM 381p. They burnt me with the choppiness and I finally decided to close for -41.7% after it bounced and bounce and bounced around. Little did I know had I just held on a little longer‚Ä¶ it woulda been a 6x position by EOD. 

Days like today are the hardest because its the time of day that if you just hold on long enough everything will be green. But days like today make the next day even harder. Because then we have this false safe feeling that ‚Äúwell if I just hold them imma get green.‚Äù And then we just keep holding and averaging down and it just keeps getting redder and redder until we realize we are too burn to even salvage anything. In this market we have to salvage our losses and mitigate our risk/ loss. 

Todays biggest lesson was 0dtes are still a great trade but EOD OTM 0dte are a big struggle. Had I just gone ATM like I usually do I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten burnt like that and felt the need to sell. I will not be playing these OTM again until days like FOMC when we fully expect the big move before it happens. 

Also had I just sat with my $1200 profits I would have been very happy but instead I ended up with just over $600 in profits. Tough day to trade today for sure.

749,1658175955,w29a3f,1,"Good afternoon everyone! Crazy day today in the market and a lot to go over. Had a good gap up over the weekend after $TSM and tech semiconductor company beat earnings and boosted forecast for next quarter. 

Slow day to start off until the big news came out that shook the market. $AAPL plans to slow hiring and spending for some teams in 2023 and APPL being sued over apple pay, accused of antitrust violations.

This news seemed to really shake the markets as the tech giant is showing signs of the rising inflation and glooming recession on the company itself. Hit some support before close now waiting on the rest of the earnings reports to come out in AH. 

With that being said this morning we opened right at the top of the bull flag channel on the daily and the top of the bearish pennant on daily as well. Couldn‚Äôt gather up steam and melted down.

With the assistance of ARMER back in May we got bored and decided to map out what the 2022 market crash COULD look like IF we followed the 2008 crash... and yes before everyone says it... i know this crash is different.. every crash is different... but all we have is historical data to go off of and trajectory wise we are the closest to 2008 then any others in my opinion...   


Anyways lets go down hypothetical lane... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/96ufqz2088c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=801eb182455a55f55aeb2478d085466e516f26b6

Here is the WEEKLY SPY 2022 chart (i deleted all my drawings for easier viewing of candles) 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6kjonxc88c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38a32b7efb371e91fb22f25e3bc990305ce3a39

And here is the 2008 weekly chart... (i adjusted zoom slightly)   
Looking at these charts... it could be inferred that we are at the last rising hump in August/ September before the massive dropped started...   


Okay lets look at some numbers...   


2022 crash prediction based on 2008 percent's- 385 --&gt; 431 (11.9% rise) --&gt; 367 (15% drop) --&gt; 392 (7% rise) --&gt; 255 (53% drop) --&gt; 301 --&gt; 229 --&gt; 301 --&gt; 217

Actual- 381 --&gt; 417 (9.5% actual rise) --&gt; 362 (13% actual drop) --&gt; 393 (8% rise) --&gt; expected 53% drop= $189

we hit 393 on June 28th. We should be right around the top again then based off these numbers... 

&amp;#x200B;

Now according to the 2008 crash... we actually are at max level before ""the big one"" IF we actually follow the 2008 crash model... we should be at our last bear market rally and should see the capitulation any time now.... 

now adjusting for the overall difference in % expected vs actual we would see something closer to 40-45% drop from 393 which puts us at around... 216-235. 

&amp;#x200B;

using previous lows from previous crashes/ corrections... the blue dotted line utilizes the 2008 crashes low and the 2020 covid crashes low to give us a predicted bottom of 255 to 280 if we were to continue the current bear market trajectory... of course a true capitulation would accelerate this and we could see that number... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3g35f12y88c91.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2992158cbbf1a47b39ff11c7ff12b706de37fc11

red dotted line uses the 2008 crashes low and the february 2016 bottom to give us a trajectory of 295 to 315 on current trajectory.

now the crazy thing about this 360 to 380 and using this covid 2020 recovery trend is that we already saw a bounce off that orange dotted line ( a near perfect bounce) June 2022 AND the weekly 200ema is now perfectly on top of this orange dotted line...

red dotted line uses the 2008 crashes low and the february 2016 bottom to give us a trajectory of 295 to 315 on current trajectory.

lastly we have the orange dotted line which utulizes the two lowest points POST covid crash (Sept 2020 and October 2020) to give us a trajectory of 360 to 370 as bottom...

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest issue with this all is the scaling of it... the 2008 crash was much slower. 2022 took 6 months to crash 25% while 2008 took 9 months to crash 25% initially. that means this crash is happening about  50% faster than 2008... so we need to bear that in mind. For reference the 2020 crash one month to crash 25% or about 9 times faster....   


so bearing that in mind when comparing charts and time frames... there is still a case to be had that the crash IS coming... the question is when and will we actually know? 

&amp;#x200B;

so what if we did know the bottom or at least knew how to predict it? 

&amp;#x200B;

it seems if we blast through 365 again we could see that 295-315  


  
In my opinion after i had 1000% expected to see a crash/ capitulation start Wednesday when that dogwater CPI came in... my best worst case scenario comes next week.   


Tesla reports wednesday night after bell... in my opinion not a big factor. It may hit or miss... i dont think markets care enough and it in and of itself can not take the markets down.   


The week of July 25th is one hell of a doozy...   

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel  


This right here is the ONLY perfect shit storm i can even remotely suspect to take the markets to the bottom... IF MSFT, GOOG, amazon all miss AND FOMC ""surprises"" (lol) us with a 100bps hike AND then GDP comes in thursday morning negative 1000% confirming we are in a recession and then APPLE tanks after bell thursday... The week of July 25th could be one of the biggest drops we have seen yet....

so how should we play this? Despite what the numbers are calling for... i am looking for SPY this week to break out to that 400 to 415 level... on the weekly chart 415 perfectly rejects the black channels resistance line AND perfectly rejects the sideways purple channel... 

IF we get the big bull run this week AND end up somewhere near 410-415 by EOW.... AND the vix unwinds down near 18-20... i think friday before market close is our chance to load up on 30-60DTE VIX calls and SPY puts...   


and then IF by some miracle the markets still rally after the week of July 25th...  then i believe the bottom IS in... i think that orange dotted line i showed you above IS the bottom....

759,1658029010,w0y0zi,1,"Most of you are like me and like to invest in scientific advancements because there's a chance for outsized gains if the tech becomes revolutionary and/or we like to encourage scientific research. However, by its nature science is difficult to monetize and only in select circumstances is any R&amp;D success repeatable over long periods.

To understand this, you must understand something about science: Engineering is applied physics and physics is applied math, but only the engineers at the tail end of it all forge marketable products. That is to say, math professors fiddling on a chalkboard produces new mathematical concepts that may or may have an application in physics. Indeed, there is a lot of ""pure mathematics"" that has no application so far. However, physicists take what can be known through math and do an experiment to learn more about the world around us. These experiments may or may not reveal some useful properties, as indeed there is ""pure physics"" where the experiments reveal nothing except how to do a new experiment. However, an engineer takes known scientific concepts and forges devises that take advantage of them.

A good example of this is the piezoelectric effect. Science found that certain crystals have their atoms in a predictable shape, and if you strike them at a certain angle the compression of the crystal forces electrons out of the atom. You ask, ""so what?"" Well, first this effect can be calculated very precisely, so these crystals make excellent digital pressure sensors. Also, these crystals produce a spark with no moving or expendable parts and are dirt cheap, so BBQ lighters have them to ignite the flame reliably.

But we all want to get into the business of science, how do you reliably produce a continuous stream of marketable inventions? We all simply copy Thomas Edison's business model of employing a modest team of engineers to make small incremental improvements to existing devices and use the royalties from those inventions to fund further work. For instance, Edison saw the Bell telephone and noted the signal faded with distance and it took two wires for every connection. Edison's team built devises that could boost signals to install at key locations, and they built devises that could hand two signals per wire, then four, then eight, then sixteen, then thirty-two, then as many as you wanted.

This process isn't necessarily the most efficient, as it requires installing devises before they're even fully invented (AKA planned obsolescence). Normally such ventures are insanely profitable for many decades and use their profits to vertically integrate every stage of selling the new product, only for the tech to mature and the venture simply becomes just another factory. For instance, gone are the days where Apple would invent a new and improved cellphone every year and people would line up at their stores to trade in their old phones for new ones. These day, people are demanding far more standardization and reliability (see the Right of Repair movement). New inventions in computers are becoming scarcer as we are near the max theoretical limit of what processors can do, although many new large and insanely complicated software applications are being forged for various purposes. It seems Apple and Microsoft are even now becoming just computer factories assembling our electronics, which is already the main source of their revenue.

This is also why a lot of discoveries are made in universities. First off because the workforce is both highly skilled and cheap, as the managers are well salaried professors and much of the work is done by grad students who literally pay to work and love it. Any equipment the college can't afford is usually provided by government research grants, and these teams do great science just so they can be known as the bad\*\*\*es that discovered stuff.

However, even knowing all this I'm sure everyone here will still invest in R&amp;D heavy companies knowing the risks and limitations. Why? For the same reason we collectively decided to spend a ten billion dollars on a giant space telescope we don't need: **Because it's fun.**",Why good science is a bad investment.,1.0,2022-07-17 03:36:50

# Elon Musk's father Errol reveals he has a child with stepdaughter

Business Today Desk - Yesterday 11:29 am

&amp;#x200B;

Arevelation by his father Errol Musk has stirred a hornet‚Äôs nest. The senior Musk claimed he had an unplanned child with his 35-year-old stepdaughter Jana Bezuidenhout three years ago. It was revealed in 2017 that Errol had a baby named Elliot Rush, now five years of age, with Jana. ¬†

üì∑¬© Provided by Business TodayElon Musk's father Errol reveals he has a child with stepdaughter¬†

‚ÄúThe only thing we are on Earth for is to reproduce,‚Äù Musk told British publication The Sun in an interview. He also said during the course of the interview that the second baby was unplanned. He said he has not done a DNA check on the second baby as of yet but her features are very similar to his daughters Rose and Tosca. ¬†

Errol further said that the second baby looks and behaves very much like Rushi, thus, making it obvious with whom he had the child. Jana Bezuidenhout is the daughter of Heide Bezuidenhuot, Errol Musk‚Äôs second wife. ¬†

Errol married Heide after separating from Maye Musk, Elon Musk‚Äôs mother, in 1979. Jana was four when the senior Musk became her stepfather. Errol and Heide were married for 18 years and had two children together. ¬†

Recently, it was reported widely that Elon had two children with a 36-year-old executive at his artificial intelligence company Neuralink, weeks before his child with girlfriend Grimes was born. ¬†

Musk is father to 9 children with three different partners, which include six children from his first wife Justine Musk, two with Claire Boucher and two with Grimes. ¬†Of the six children Musk had with Justine, one passed at 10 months due to an illness. ¬†",Elon Musk's father Errol reveals he has a child with stepdaughter,1.0,2022-07-16 07:00:07

I saw a really interesting chart today that shows the UMICH consumer sentiment vs the Russel 1000 that shows they are severely diverted from eachother. 

What does this mean? Well this is the furtherest they have ever been from eachother in the last 30 years. There is still a lot of people out there that thinks despite how far the market has come down that there is still a very long way to go. I would have thought CPI woulda started the next leg down but that is not the case‚Ä¶ lets get into that a little bit. 

https://preview.redd.it/ntef185ersb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=205de0ab1f8401b1fea3bfa422dcde6a13c58da9

Yesterday the fed went from ‚Äúwe will not be doing a 100bps hike‚Äù to wow yeah man we really just might do a 100bps hike back today where now its down to a 17% chance of 100bps hike. The craziest thing about this all is if you look at the last CPI it jumped from 8.3% to 8.6% from April to May and JPOW shit himself and the markets did too with a massive 75bps hike that was not expected‚Ä¶ now CPI is up 0.5% HIGHER than previous CPI (more than last time which was only 0.3%) and all of a sudden it doesn‚Äôt matter what we do rate hike wise and markets don‚Äôt care about 75 vs. 100bps hike? 

Confused? Me too‚Ä¶ I touch on this a little below as to what I suspect is the true thing going on. 

https://preview.redd.it/t339fnversb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79712e9d1e204460a4cb516d7c50ff700396a6fa

I mentioned on the CPI night that I think we are experiencing some psyops in the market‚Ä¶ the media is fueling this rollercoaster and we are being led astray for now. It is even more evident by the VIX that the ‚Äúfear‚Äù is being contained right now‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/86mdud1grsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6863b2f55ecccf654fd87d8426b4d53b6f5ff82e

The VIX daily chart is very telling of current sentiment and that is that nothings going to take us down. After spy had 4 days of red this week and closed out today green for this week SPY is only down $0.72 cents on the week. They were close to closing this week out as a green week. 

This is the lowest close on the VIX since June 8th. Interestingly enough June 8th was the top of the last trend before we crashed. Looking at the vix there is a case that we could see a bounce Monday around 23.9 on the VIX at that support level which would let SPY truly top before we start our next leg down. 

I am also now if we break through that 23.9 level under the impression that the markets are going to completely unwind the VIX down to 18-20 level before tesla earnings hit on Wednesday night. Tesla will be the first notable earnings that could move the markets and then the week after that is massive with MSFT, GOOG, APPLE, and META. Not only that but we also have FOMC on Wednesday the 27th and then GDP is on July 28th the next day. That GDP should confirm a recession. 

Many of you red my UVXY/ VIX calls post and I do believe I was correct. The one thing I am wondering is if I was wrong on the timing. I suspect markets to panic from CPI to FOMC like previously but I am wondering if markets are going to rally from CPI to FOMC and then once that week of earnings and FOMC and GDP happen markets then panic till the next CPI and FOMC. At this point I think watching for the VIX to hit 18-20 and UVXY to hit 11.5 again to go long on some 30-60dte calls is the way to go. This is the lowest close for UVXY since April 21st interestingly enough. UVXY also has not closed under 11.5 since January. So that will be a key level to watch for next week.

The one thing im really watching on the daily is the close of this candle. It is a hanging man LIKE candle but the wick is not long enough. So this could end up like a continuation candle similar to June 23rd instead of a reversal candle like May 17th. 

https://preview.redd.it/om58fu6hrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee04dd25917171850484aaea0cbd89b3863abb7a

Things to note here for a bull vs. bear case on daily and weekly chart. 

Bull case- despite a bearish catalyst week we managed to close it with a dragonfly doji. Despite all the craziness we saw this week we saw a bullish finish to the week. We got our weekly 372 channel support test/ bounce. On the daily we broke through the red dotted resistance line which means we made a high high. We also close above the daily 8ema AND the daily 20ema for the first time since last Friday.  

Bear case- on the weekly we saw a new lower low for the third week in a row and that was also followed by the third lower high too. While we did not confirm resistance there is a VERY large descending wedge forming on the weekly chart. We have enough of the triangle left that there is a case we see a rejection next week followed by a descent below. Despite the bullish close today one could assume the last three days of bullish volume came from OPEX and how much downward OI there was. We now have a daily gap of $1.54 on the daily (note- this gap is actually closer to $2 as the daily movement of SPY never actually hit $379.05 on Thursday despite what the candles say). While historically gaps always fill we still have a 402 gap above unfilled so that is not something you can say anymore. 

Daily supports to watch- 382 √† 379 (gap fill) √† 375 √† 370 (channel support) 

Weekly supports to watch- 372 (channel support) √† 364 (weekly 200ema)

Daily resistance to watch- 388 √† 390 (downward channel support AND sideways channel support) √† 393 √† 398 √† 402 (gap fill)

Weekly resistance to watch- 388 (ascending wedge resistance) √† 413 (downward channel resistance)

What I am watching for is whether we are going to attempt to back fill this gap Monday or Tuesday or whether we are going to break through 390. 390 is a HUGE level for Monday. IF that level is broken then we are actually hella bullish. With no major earnings to really effect the market and no real economic data to effect it either till Thursday at open we just might see a hell of a ripper early next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/5zggc0vhrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9804cfbd004521003749725d4227a650c72d2392

ES daily actually looks a little different than SPYs. I mentioned yesterday that it looked like futures was turning bullish and it appears Thursday might be the temp bottom again. We did see a rejection of that blue dotted support line at 3867 EOD today though but it closed over the daily 8 AND 20 ema for the first time since July 8th (which ironically was top). 

I am watching on the daily for Mondays open if we see a red open and we hold resistance at 3850 we will most likely be headed for a back test of that key 3744 support. Sundays night open will be very very important to watch. Anything over 3850 Sunday is bullish for the week. 

Daily supports to watch- 3793 √† 3744 √† 3672 (channel support) 

Daily resistance to watch- 3850 √† 3915 (channel support) √† 4020

https://preview.redd.it/305c46dirsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=946d2343961418ae9a82028e7630a4d59e9e8239

Futures weekly chart is probably the most bearish of anything I have talked about yet. So it will be curious to see which one plays out. 

The weekly chart actually confirmed the resistance of the descending triangle on Monday and closed with a true hanging man candle. This true hanging man candle has me suspect that we are going to see a retrace come Monday that takes us back down to that 3675 area. The futures charts are more skeptical and bearish then SPY itself. 

If we were to have a mega bull week next week we could see not only the descending wedge broken (any open over 3875 breaks it) we could see the overall downward channel and the overall sideways channel broken. It would take an impressive 7.7% move to do it but with the way the markets are running its not impossible. Or we could see a retest of that channel and rejection which could confirm further downside in two weeks for FOMC/ earnings/ GDP.

Weekly supports- 3830 √† 3675

Weekly resistance- 3875 √† 4136 √† 4165

Overall SPY/ ES I would say I am bullish next week and will be looking to position to be bearish the following week.

AMD actually had a hell of a great day and week this week. AMD looks to on the daily have established a V shaped recovery at 71.6. My pre-market plan was to go long on AMD after it back tested 79.5 support and then go long with 7dte calls for next week looking for 87 range. I should have done it but I decided to wait. I am hesitant only that the markets are a little irrational right now. Most likely will regret that next week. 

Daily supports- 79.5 √† 76.6 √† 71.6

Daily resistance- 83.8 √† 87

https://preview.redd.it/t7em8pjjrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a546f501675e7732e435ba25a37d583fd9868007

AMD weekly is in a nice descending wedge too. The weekly candle is a hanging man so that worries me but it should be able to push through if it keeps up the same momentum. Overall we are looking for 87 resistance to be tested next week and to hold that v shaped support line. If we break through 87‚Ä¶ 95-98 is on the table for sure. But any retracement below 77 would be noted as bearish omen. 

10% challenge-

I had a great but boring day today. I did not like the open today as we dumped then ripped and had some wild candles. With the massively green open and UMICH sentiment I knew I was not going to go in until closer to 1030-11. By them we were already at the probable high of day IV wise and I was not going to play anything above that. My strategy is very strict about not going long/ short when SPY hits those levels. I also noticed that IV on SPY and AMD were hella high today and my mid day we got crushed. I watched 384.6 resistance hold all day long and EOD played a nice SPX (my first one) 0dte put scalp off the breakdown and then played a SPY 0dte call once biden was done talking and the volume came pumping in. Overall GREAT day and GREAT week. 

This is actually the highest weekly WIN RATE year to date for me. This week I was EXTRA patient and really waited for my plays and waited for the chart to come to me. It made all the difference.

I look forward to a good weekend to rest. I am sitting cash gang over the weekend. I was tempted to go long on SPY calls but decided to stick to what it old myself at the beginning of the month and do no swings. The biggest loss this week came from CPI day. It came from ANTICIPATING a play AND it came from trading while SPY was at the probable IV range. I did not stick to my guns that day and I did not let the chart come to me. I also double down on that loser which became 2x as big of a loser. Doubling down can work when tactfully done‚Ä¶ but most of the time like I have said before don‚Äôt add to a loser to make it a bigger loser‚Ä¶ I also took a loss on Monday due to TOS not filling my order completely which is a logistical issue I could not avoid and is part of the risk of 0dtes in the last 15minutes. 

Overall great week for me mentally and trading wise. Look forward to the weekend with the fam and seeing you guys back on Monday!","7-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX/ UVXY and AMD weekly TA",1.0,2022-07-15 21:07:15

What‚Äôs the rumor about? Well apparently chinese people are dying to buy iphones. They are literally killing each other to get an iphone. 

But wait. Isn‚Äôt the asian market known to always want the best product configuration available for the cheapest price? I.e their iphones have dual sim slot, their androids have the fastest processors. While in the west people are happy with what they get. 

Let‚Äôs look at apple today and their future line up. Their core business is still the iphone, their next line up iphone 14 will have the old. A15 chip that‚Äôs already in the iPhone 13. 
Their new macbook air base model 256gb has a 30-40% slower ssd than the last generation but with a rougly 30% price spike. You really think the asian market is gonna buy any of these products?

Why would apple do that? Why are they selling the new air with old ssd and a huge price? Well they are sitting on a huge inventory not able to sell those parts off so they have to recycle them as long as possible. 

What are the possible outcomes: 
1. Apple beats earnings by 10%: dump incoming as people expected more and it was already priced in
2. Apple earnings estimates are correct: huge dump incoming
3. Apple misses earnings estimates completely: astronomical dump incoming 

Tldr: Smart money is putting out rumors so they can dump their stack on retail. Big dump expected even before earnings in 2 weeks.",Don‚Äôt get lured into buying aapl,1.0,2022-07-15 13:23:48
768,1657864791,vzh8hh,1,"Xerox will be familiar to many as the manufacturer of presses, copiers and printers.

 The firm has annual revenues of U$17bn and a niche in high end (U$100,000+) printers where the firm has around 70% market share. It is a reasonably profitable but modest growth operation.

 The firm enjoyed several good years in the early and mid 1990s following the introduction of a 
new generation of machines but by the late 1990s growth had declined markedly. Perhaps 
aware that Wall Street rewarded earnings growth above all other metrics, management 
asserted that earnings per share would rise by 15% per annum and the shares began to rise to 
discount the near certainty they would.

 However, 15% growth in earnings is tricky to achieve for any length of time especially from a 5% revenue growth business and management began, and indeed was egged on by Wall Street, to find growth from an alternative source.
In a cartoon carried in the Wall Street Journal two accountants sit opposite each other in a 
prison cell.

 You know, one says to the other, in accounting it is best to think inside the box! 


Xerox management would have done well to read this cartoon in 1996 or 1997 as it was about 
that time that management began to push too hard to grow earnings. One of the ways this was 
achieved was through booking profits from long term lease contracts upfront.

 It is quite possible, indeed likely, that one could have a happy and successful life without knowing about lease and sale accounting, so if the topic bores you, skip the next paragraph.
For everyone else, welcome to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 
""Accounting for Leases"".

We will try to be brief. There are two types of leases, operating and sale-type. 

Under an operating lease a lessee rents an item for a short period and the total rent payments are usually a fraction of the value of the rented item. Car rental contracts are usually of this type. 

The difference between an operating lease and a sale-type lease is a matter of scale. A sale-type lease is usually for a much longer period and in effect transfers a much larger portion of the economic value of the asset to the lessee, a contract for the use of an airplane for the rest of its economic life would be a sale-type lease. 
The former is rental contract, the latter more of a sale.

 Now for the accounting. The accountants differentiate between the two using SFAS 13 which states that that contracts which transfer 75% or more of the economic life of the leased asset, or where minimum lease payments are 90% or greater than the fair value of the asset, be treated as a sale-type lease, with lesser values treated as an operating lease.

 The crucial difference is how they are recorded in the accounts. 

Sale-type leases require the leased asset to be booked as if sold outright, in effect bringing forward revenues and profits. In contrast, payments under an operating lease are booked incrementally over the lease term. It is important to note that whether a transaction is deemed an operating lease or a sale-type lease, cash -flow is unaffected.

 The customer still pays the rental, as 
required, it is only the accounting that implies something else has happened.


When Xerox leases an expensive printer, it is often in the form of a five-year contract which 
bundles equipment, a service contract and financing. However, in a bundled contract there is some discretion as to how much is attributable to the value of the equipment and how much should be deferred to later years in recognition of financing, maintenance and service. 

One can therefore understand how management, plump with stock options and growth in earnings per share related bonuses, were strongly incented to recognise earnings up front and SFAS 13 allowed them to do this. The value of the equipment was incorrectly raised relative to service, financing and maintenance which allowed the firm to treat the transaction as a sale-type lease and required that the inflated equipment value be booked as if sold. A double whammy of inflated revenues and profits recognised early.

 This does not appear to be illegal, although it 
is hardly conservative. It may even have mattered less if Xerox had not relied upon the 
commercial paper market to fund its receivables business. When the company announced that 
earnings would be below Wall Street expectations, the SEC announced an investigation into the firm‚Äôs accounting and the auditors were replaced, the result was that the credit markets all but closed to the firm, and the shares declined to 7% of their peak price.


It is important to put this in perspective. In the five years to 2001, cumulative revenues at 
Xerox approached U$90bn, of which U$6.4bn was incorrectly booked. Cash flow and free 
cash flow, the basis of our valuation of the firm, is completely unaffected. 

Customers continued to pay their bills monthly as arranged. Operating blunders associated with product extensions, again designed to raise the growth rate, have been reversed and investment in research and development maintained at around U$1bn per annum regardless of the turmoil all around. Earlier this year the firm completed negotiations with its banks to repay the debts over the next few years in easily digested increments that should be funded from internally generated cash flow and U$1.8bn of cash on hand. 

The operating turnaround is now well 
under way, and a new product cycle, in some lines the first new products for ten years, will 
see products launched at twice the rate of the late 1990s. Even after new auditors have been 
appointed the debate about the accounting continues.

 It is with some irony that the replaced 
accountants protest that Xerox‚Äôs profit is now understated. Xerox might be alone in corporate 
America in this regard. And, as if to prove that truth is stranger than fiction, the new accounting methodology will result in higher revenues and profits over the next few years than under the previous discredited policy. This matters not a jot to us, note again: cash flow . 

So, what is the business worth? The firm has around U$1bn in free cash flow per annum after 
interest, taxes and maintenance levels of investment spending (capex, marketing and R&amp;D) which should permit the net debt of around U$2bn (U$17bn of total debts are offset against 
U$15bn of trade and long-term receivables and cash) to be repaid over the next few years. 
Indeed, if the apple cart is to be upset, it is likely to come from a dilutive share issuance, 
something we are lobbying management to resist, hopefully more effectively than the bankers who are egging them on. 

The current market valuation of U$4.5bn is just four and a half years free cash flow or four and a half years research and development spending. We estimate the capitalised value of the R&amp;D asset may be around U$7bn or approximately 50% more than the current market capitalisation. 

As a cash cow the firm may be worth around U$14 per share in our opinion, although the increase in new product launches from two per annum to four per annum during the next three years may result in modest growth as well. 

Presently the firm is valued at U$6 per share, less than half our appraisal of its real worth. Trading volume of Xerox stock implies investors own the shares for under four months on average, a time horizon which implies few investors are focused on the long-term value of the business but rather are betting on the next quarter‚Äôs outcome. Rich pickings, we suspect, for the patient.

Now this won't be that technical, because I am not a smart man. I wouldn't be here if I was. But this morning as I was watching $SPY and looking at my puts go up in price at open I was happy for about 5 minutes and then watched as they flipped and went back down. I was watching my list and trying to figure out why is this happening. Probably like most people here, or at least the other people who are highly regarded like me.

Well I found it, partly from other people smarter then me pointing it out. But I did a little work hitting print screen and making some pictures everyone can look at.

[So this was $SPY today.](https://preview.redd.it/j15efj8mygb91.jpg?width=2934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57b33aba4c6841f4a17a4fd8068cf32dcc0d8c4)

Now for the smart people here they know that $SPY is a bunch of different stocks bundle up into one stock people can trade. So if all the stocks in that ETF are doing bad then the ETF will go down. This will also cause it to go up if they are all doing good. Pretty simple right? Well it's not that simple, but it will work for what I am trying to get across.

So $SPY is an ETF and is made up of a bunch of stocks and those stocks are bunched up into sectors and they are weighted by how much $SPY has invested in each one. The biggest/heaviest one is for technology and you can look it up under $XLK.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here I did it for you, this is today.](https://preview.redd.it/kzt8so430hb91.jpg?width=2962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff161fdb9f1abdcc7c6dc1b587cef170e4ef43bc)

If you wanna check out the full list you can see it here.

If you don't check it out I will break it down real fast for you.

Tech 24.17%

Healthcare 15.17%

Financial Services 12.92%

Consumer Cyclical 10.28%

Communication Services 8.84%

There is other stuff but I am lazy, just click the link and check for yourself.

So back to $XLK and why it's important. In this group of stocks are a few everyone here knows. But the one I wanna talk about is $AAPL which is 5.90% of the total assets $SPY has invested. That not just under the tech umbrella, that is everything. It might not seem like a big deal when you see $MSFT is 5.60% of $SPY's assets. But trust me that .30% is a big deal. Here take a look at this chart.

My fellow Apes and Tards,
              Powell is in a jam, money printer is broke and it‚Äôs going to be hard to get out of this one without looking reckless and incompetent.  I think the only way Powell saves face is to announce an emergency rate hike of 100-175 basis points.  Now fellow smooth brains, please entertain my slightly more wrinkled brain for a moment.  

CPI was way over expectations, rates will rise the next FOMC a minimum of .75, the tricky part is if Powell does nothing until FOMC but wait to raise rates to the expected .75, then he is opening himself up to years of ridicule and possibly some sort of legal issues, if congress wants to make him the scape goat for all the terrible government policies and spending that has put us in this situation to begin with.  

Let‚Äôs look ahead, Microsoft has already issued warnings and Apple is apparently ‚Äúnot immune to a recession either‚Äù.  Both have earnings on the 26th, two days before the FOMC rate decision.  I think it‚Äôs safe to say they will both tank and pull the market down a bit, July earnings are historically rarely good.  After which the market recovers 2 days later and bam, FOMC raises .75 only and the market tanks because it‚Äôs not enough or possibly rallies because Powell does what he did last time and act more aggressively like he has been signaling.  In my opinion, either scenario and Powell is fukd!  Why?!

Two days after FOMC is‚Ä¶.. GDP for the second quarter, damn it man, busy week I know!  I just don‚Äôt see how Powell comes out of this smelling like anything other than bullshit.  Think about it, GDP is bad, but not negative and the only plus is we are not. ‚ÄúTechnically‚Äù in a recession.  On the whole we are not a healthy economy, why?  Powell was late to act.  Now for the likely scenario, and yes it‚Äôs the most gay scenario I could think off but not what I or the country wants, we miss GDP again and confirm a recession, well fuk!  Now, not only has Powell either acting not aggressively enough or too slow, now we are in a Recession, this would be the straw that pops this bubble we call a market and send us into a real crash!

Remember folks, it‚Äôs an election year, if this plays out, the blame game will surely start now. Honestly I don‚Äôt see a way Powell doesn‚Äôt get crucified for this other than to announce a emergency rate hike now!  at least then he can answer all the negative press and questions like a professional to save the market crash and assure the public he has a plan and that measures are already in place, thus explaining the emergency rate rise he did early.

PDD started its dramatic promotion activities "" Billions Subsidies"", which means that PPD promises that they will spend more than a Billion RMB as Subsidies to help lower price of goods sold on their platform as a strategy to attract customer and supplier, in 2019.

Interesting Things happened after i made the order.

They do not ship the product. I waited for more than a month. They just refuse to ship the product. PDD customer service guy even ask me to apply for refund.

I searched on ""Baidu"", a popular search engine in China, millions of PDD cases like this happened, most of them are related to ""Billions Subsidies"" Activity.

They just make ""Fake Sales"".

But according to account rule, if refunded, sales revenue will not be recorded, then **where PDD can play tricks? ""Transaction Service Reveunue""**

PDD will take service fee on each of transaction, about 3%-5% of amount, charged to suppliers(who sell goods through PDD platform). Even if the order is canceled, refunded or in other situations, the transaction fee is not refundable to suppliers. **This means that PDD can infinitly recogize its trasaction revenue as they want, through ""Fake Sales"".**

Is there any supplier want to infinitly give money to PDD?

What if PDD is the supplier? What if PDD has relation with supplier? I do not know.

I tried to figure it out. However, i cannot find any suppliers' company name on PDD APP.

What's more, Customer Service guy refuse to name any of their suppliers.

In this circumstances, i reseanably suspect that:

1. **PDD and their suppliers' have certain relationship that to make fake revenue.**
2. **All of Transaction Service Revenue through ""Billion Subsides"" is fake**
3. **The fake amount can be Billion RMB accourding to its title ""Billion Subsides""**

I would be appreciated if anyone can help to gather more informations or evidances.

**For More Inofrmation:**

Starting from 2019, there is one new revenue catagory appeared in ""PDD Financial Report"", which is ""Transaction Service"".

Starting from 2019 ""Billions Subsidies"" Promotion Activity appeared.

Introduction:

Hello fellow degenerates, I am back after a brief hiatus. I got way too caught up in work, holiday shenanigans, and lots of other BS. However, I am finally back on my horse and I am ready to bring some more smooth-brained DD to you all. I have been on a bit of a cold streak lately with my positions but I‚Äôve got a feeling this is the Aaron Judge 450 foot homer I have been seeking. What I will be doing with this post is simply a general DD on the current state of the market. I am going to present topics and attempt to give as objective a take as one man can. Full disclosure however in that before even diving into any research, I myself am very bearish on the markets in the short term. What I will be taking a position in come market open tomorrow is the SPY ETF. For those of you who have consumed more crayons than myself, the SPY ETF refers to the S&amp;P 500 index and is weighted accordingly to the index fund itself. It is heaviest in technology stocks (24.66%) however it is very diverse also holding healthcare (15.08%), financial services (12.86%), consumer cyclical (10.66%), communication services (9.1%), industrials (8.14%), consumer defensive (7.28%), energy (4.18%), utilities (2.99%), real estate (2.86%), and basic materials (2.19%). Additionally, the top 10 individual holdings within SPY are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Nvidia. In total they make up 27.72% of SPY‚Äôs total assets. All that being said, let‚Äôs dive into this irrational cesspool that we currently call a market.

The consumer price index is expected to come in at an annual rate of 8.8% year over year with month over month expected to come in at 0.6%. As everyone knows, inflation has been running rampant and crushing economists' expectations lately leading to the current falls in general markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

Well, if the CPI comes in at or under economists expectations I believe a massive market rally will ensue on the news that will unfortunately cause some damage to the puts that I plan on partaking in. The reason the market will rally is simply because that would show inflation has possibly peaked and therefore Jerome Powell and our central bank may consider not being as hawkish and utilizing a less aggressive rate hike at their next meeting in a few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

If the CPI comes in above already lofty expectations, I expect the market to take another dive back to previous lows set in June, quite possibly surpassing them in the coming weeks. This would be because in addition to the surprise in total nonfarm payrolls smashing expectations, this would show that the U.S. economy is still running hot currently and the 75 basis point rate hike discussed at the most recent FOMC Minutes would be more than justified. In an unbelievably red hot inflation scenario, word could spread of a possible full percent (100 bps) hike which would undoubtedly obliterate the SPY and cause puts to more than print. My evidence for this statement is to look at what the market did in June after ONE 75 basis point hike and high CPI data. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Retail Sales (MoM) - Friday 

Retail sales are expected to come in at 0.9% for the month of June. Previously, Retail sales came in at -0.3% which should in theory signal a possible coming recession due to the slower consumption of retail goods by Americans. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

If Retail Sales come in below expectations or especially if they come in negative this time yet again, this also will signal an incoming recession and again could trigger the Fed to lighten up on the rate hikes which could cause a bullish bounce of sorts or even a market rebound as investors come to expect the easy money to return to the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

If retail sales come in above expectations this will signal consumers still have money in which they are willing to spend on retail goods which will incline the Fed to be more hawkish, which again would cause the markets to dump. Should we get a high CPI in conjunction with high retail sales, a 75 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting has a much higher probability of occurring. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Michigan Consumer Sentiment

First, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment is a monthly survey of how consumers feel about the economy, personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. The University of Michigan conducts at least 500 phone calls and covers personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions over 50 questions with US consumers. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bull Take

Ironically, if US consumer sentiment drops to new all time lows this will be bullish for the market as again it will try to lean the Fed into a more dovish position and perhaps only hike rates 50 bps instead of the discussed 75 bps. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bear Take

Consumer sentiment rallies, defying expectations and shows optimism among American consumers. Again, if this and the CPI both follow the bearish take or all 3 I personally believe that this will be too much for markets and puts on the SPY will be in for some tendies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My Personal Opinion

Much of this is crystal ball guesswork my friends. I cannot tell you what will occur and if I could I wouldn‚Äôt still be giving dandy handies behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster. However, I do believe that CPI will come in higher than expected. This is due to past CPI coming in hotter than expected and most importantly this data is for the month of June. Energy prices, especially oil went berserk for the entirety of June which should carry CPI above expectations alone. Not only that but literally anything I have bought has continued to go up in price on a literal monthly basis. While my Hoosier ass is by no means a proxy for the entirety of inflation and the economy it is still telling. 

Additionally, I believe that one of the two following economic indicators (retail sales or consumer sentiment) will also follow a path that makes the Fed have to raise interest rates by at least 75 bps at their meeting in a few weeks. It is this interest rate raise that I believe will crush markets at least in the very near future. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Exit Plan:

By all means get greedy if you guys would like but I figured I would post my own thoughts for how I plan to proceed. I am going to buy 3 SPY $380 8/19 Puts at market open tomorrow morning. This is to get ahead of the economic indicators occurring this week and quite possibly make a nice 25% on my investment before the market even closes Friday. Personally I believe these contracts could do so by then and I would be happy with a \~$750 gain in a few days on a \~$3,000 investment. 

If I am wrong though and these contracts lose value as the market decides to rally, I will be doubling down on my position, putting all of my capital in and scooping up as many contracts as I can. I will more than likely do so on Friday after Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment data to hopefully get the best price per contract. 

In a worst case scenario, I will sell at a loss, selling all of my contracts on August 1st before Theta begins to obliterate my sweet cheeks more than it already will have by that point. This would be done to save some capital and have a chance at recouping my losses. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 

Higher than forecasted inflation + Higher than forecasted Consumer sentiment + Higher than forecasted Retail Sales = JPow hiking rates and sending us full speed ahead into a recession, crushing equities and therefore making lots of money for bears. If you do not comprehend the above sentence, here is a one month SPY chart, I‚Äôm buying $380 strike puts, I‚Äôm not asking for the apocalypse, just a nice short term dip, who cares what happens after.

Here my friends is the Daily Chart of the VIX for all of 2022. What do you see?

Green channel- this is where we spend a lot of the beginning of the January and February and briefly spent time in April. This range is 18.7 to 25.5.

Orange channel- this is where we peak in Feb and March and spent almost all of May, June and July until last week. This ranges from 25.5 to 34.7

You also see we just broke major ‚Äúsupport‚Äù on the black dotted line last Thursday on the VIX. You also see we have been making lower highs on the VIX since January 24th we have not made a new peak. And we also haven‚Äôt made a recent higher high since May 2nd. 

Time wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX &gt;25.5.

IF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX ‚Äúbottom‚Äù tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn‚Äôt have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. 

This means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. 

Current positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn‚Äôt properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th.

What does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the ‚Äúbig one‚Äù and see ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn‚Äôt quite seal the deal. 

If my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. 

The one question that we don‚Äôt know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. 

On Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT

On July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google

On July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.

On July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel

The week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven‚Äôt already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July.

IF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don‚Äôt see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. 

All I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC‚Ä¶ Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July.

Thanks for making dollar so strong compared to our money, my broker now shows my account just -20% when I am -40% on almost everything because the Euro has fallen 20% with respects to the dolar.

An Iphone 13 is 899‚Ç¨ and 6 months ago that would mean 1029 USD, while now it is just 907 USD. So basically the money Apple are getting for each phone sale have dropped with 14% in the last 6 months. 

I think this is not priced in the earnings calculations and estimations. I know a lot of phones are sold in the US, but any market outside will have their margins wacked because of the currency.

794,1657188905,vtf90s,1,"Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has recently been a staple of ‚Äúinvesting meme‚Äù space since early 2022. Throughout social media, she is both famous and infamous for her lucrative investments in the stock market. TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit - throughout various channels of social media, you will find investing influencers publicizing and discussing the congresswoman‚Äôs latest stock trades as a proxy to get ahead in the stock market.

According to the STOCK (stop trading on congressional knowledge) act, all members of Congress must disclose any financial transaction of stocks within 45 days of purchase, and the trades they make are accessible to the public. Discussion of these trades has especially been active on ‚Äúr/wallstreetbets‚Äù, a subreddit forum where retail investors discuss current stock market trends; the same subreddit in which retail investors banded together to influence the market through the GameStop short squeeze back in January 2021.

Part of the reason why Nancy Pelosi has garnered so much social media attention is due to her successes ‚Äì one after another‚Ä¶after another. In July 2021, she made $5.3 million by exercising call options to buy 4000 shares of google, moments before the House Judiciary Committee voted on antitrust regulation. Other very profitable stock picks like Tesla, CrowdStrike, and Apple have drawn the eyes of retail investors, even causing a debate about whether Congress members should be allowed to dabble in the stock market or not.

The multi-millionaire congresswoman has done quite well in the stock market - but she has a competitive advantage: her husband. Paul Pelosi, who was recently arrested and charged with a DUI, runs a venture capital firm and is responsible for all the trades that Pelosi files. According to the New York Post, Pelosi has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by nearly 15% in 2020 - Paul seems to be more responsible with his wife's investments than he is behind the wheel. In light of her success, young retail investors are attempting to copy her stock moves to identify long-term winners.

* SPY closed down 0.81%
* QQQ closed down 1.24%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.82%
* VIX closed up 1.95%

Today market the end of the first half of 2022. The S&amp;P 500 had its worse first half of a year since 1970 and the Nasdaq had its worst start ever. Year to date (YTD) the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 21.03% and the Nasdaq 30.34%. The current market is attempting to rally but is under severe strain and may fall back down to the previous lows. It is hard to be either long or short because of the whipsaw action like todays mini rally and subsequent selloff.

[SPY Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/ordaxm278y891.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71def4283a483b840da6e52f6f0a5ba38d69ca6e)

SPY gapped down and opened about 1.00% off of yesterdays lows. We then proceeded to see a selloff of approximately 0.75% before rallying to reach the 8 EMA (red line). If this mini rally would have held the market action would have actually been quite productive. Instead SPY sold off after reaching the 8 EMA and closed only slightly up from the open, about 0.25%. Today was slightly helpful for the market rally but not by much, the fact that SPY was able to somewhat hold its ground was good to see. There was also an increase in volume compared to the last few days.

[QQQ Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/2pawcvv78y891.png?width=2262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a580449c99bee81129718786dc9bc3bd2aa2f871)

QQQ behaved very similarly to SPY but closed below its open for the day. This is nothing out of the ordinary for 2022 since QQQ has been hit harder during this bear market. Currently, QQQ and SPY are both approximately 2.60% from their lows for the year, so one rough day could trigger new lows and a new wave fo selling.

**Recap on recent positions:**

I am not currently in any positions and am sitting in cash. I will be looking to go short if QQQ breaks below its lows for the move. I will also be looking to go long if SPY breaks Wednesdays highs. Heavy volume either direction will be needed for this trade to trigger. Ideally we would see a large increase in daily volume if either of these positions trigger.

**Potential Setups:**

Besides the potential with SPY and QQQ there are very few stocks setting up with high probability patterns.

[AAPL Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/qsrdmsv88y891.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d0ea7a3eb989248258b400e62ca352c98f1bcfc)

AAPL is forming a potential higher low setup. The low set today is higher than the low set around the 22nd of June. This setup looks promise because of todays price action closing near the highs of the day after retreating nearly 2.30% during the day. It is important to note that no setup is 100% foolproof, as we can see from earlier in the year on this chart where a higher low failed. These type of setups should also only be bought if the market is in good condition and rising, especially on megacap stocks like Apple that make up a large portion of SPY and QQQ holdings.

[AMZN Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/uqsj58t98y891.png?width=2250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb2e773159260097d587b6a2f3b33f36ecacbfc5)

AMZN has also formed a higher low similarly to AAPL. With this setup the lows are much closer together in terms of price. This may not affect the potential of this trade working but means that a small negative move will quickly invalidate the setup. Both stocks have the potential to trigger but need to have a strong market as well and large volume come through the buy points as they take out todays highs.

**Bringing everything together:**

There are very few slam dunk setups forming, although there are several higher lows that may prove promising. With this weekend being a 3 day weekend we may see low volume tomorrow. This is not the worst that could happen as a calm day may give the market a chance to relax. It is also not the best idea to go on a large buying spree tomorrow as this market is very news driven and may react sharply in either direction. If the indices or individual stocks trigger, only buy a small portion of your initial position so if a quick reversal happens it is not as damaging.",Market Outlook 07/01/2022,1.0,2022-07-01 12:18:34

When reports surfaced¬†that USC and UCLA had been in negotiations to join the Big Ten on Thursday, Apple was reportedly reinvigorated to engage in media rights involving the Big Ten, according to¬†[Sports Business Journal](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/SB-Blogs/SBJ-Unpacks/2022/06/30.aspx).

Prior to the negotiations and now approval of USC and UCLA to join the Big Ten in 2024, the Big Ten had planned to conclude its media rights negotiations in July as the league was set to surpass $1 billion in annual media rights fees.¬†

However, with Bruins and Trojans‚Äô approval to join the league, the negotiations could stretch to August and may not be completed until after Labor Day, per Sports Business Journal.

As Apple seeks to change its bidding strategy for media rights with the Big Ten, the competition from other networks will be increased as well. Prior to the league adding the two high-profile schools, Fox Sports had secured a deal to carry close to half of the league‚Äôs conference games.

&amp;#x200B;

CBS, on the other hand, was in a prime position to carry some of the Big Ten‚Äôs Saturday football games. With that, Sports Business Journal, Amazon, ESPN and NBC were all bidding for a third package to secure games with the league. Even more, Apple and Warner Brothers Discovery were not viewed as tenable bidders, per Sports Business Journal.

Thursday‚Äôs landmark move of the two Los Angeles-based programs to the Big Ten started in conversations a few months ago. Both schools have been a part of the Pac-12 for quite some time.¬†

The move furthers speculation that college sports is headed towards a ‚ÄúPower 2‚Äù system in which the Big Ten and SEC continue to poach big-name programs from other leagues. The sentiment throughout the college football world is that the two leagues could grow to 30‚Äì35 teams each, operating as a ‚Äúsemi-professional model‚Äù of the sport, per Dellenger.

809,1656647852,vordm2,1,"Apple‚Äôs former senior director of corporate law and corporate secrecy has officially admitted to partaking in an insider trading scheme. Gene Levoff was first¬†indicted for insider trading¬†in 2019, and while he was¬†initially¬†fighting the charges, he has now admitted to his role in these insider trading transactions.

Levoff started at Apple in 2008 and served as a senior director of corporate law from 2013 until 2018. The trades in question were made between 2011 and 2016, the indictment says.

As reported by¬†Law360, Levoff has admitted to misappropriating nonpublic information about Apple‚Äôs financial information; he would then use this information to make trades with Apple stock. In total, the scheme allowed Levoff to generate $227,000 in profit and avoid $377,000 in losses.

When Levoff would know that Apple had strong revenue and net profit for a given financial quarter, he would purchase large quantities of AAPL stock and sell it once the rest of the market reacted to the news.

As we‚Äôve said before, this case is incredibly ironic: one of Levoff‚Äôs responsibilities at Apple included enforcing the company‚Äôs insider trading policy. In fact, he even informed Apple employees about a trading blackout period for AAPL stock, while also buying and selling the stock himself.

The details of the punishment Levoff will face are still unclear, but each count in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.",Former Apple exec tasked with enforcing insider trading rules admits to insider trading,1.0,2022-07-01 03:57:32

Gaps- we currently have TWO gaps below us now‚Ä¶ 381.37 to 378.83 and 370.18 to 369.38 and we have one gap left above 401.44 to 395.78. The gap above is the biggest and longest over due. 

Dotted blue bull channel- we officially broke through this support channel today when we broke under 383. So lets get that one removed from the chart. 

Black dotted bear channel- we PERFECTLY rejected the resistance line at 393 today so that‚Äôs a keeper. We now have a downward target of about 370 tomorrow or 372 for Thursday for a support test. If we break this that‚Äôs a pretty big deal and should confirm we are going to see a lower low here next month.

Rising wedge (bearish)- we officially BROKE DOWNWARD from this rising wedge pattern. Hella bearish! 

https://preview.redd.it/puoap7oh9f891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0ee5a8a02bd364478253b5076ea68eec23d5400

Here we go we now have just the black bull channel and the new red dotted bear channel. 

As you can see I have highlighted a thick blue ABCDE pattern I am watching for the future. I think that pattern could take us down to 340 next month. Overall what this pattern is saying is that since January SPY has been making a lower low followed by a lower high that then brings the next lower low. This is a classic bear market pattern. 

Bulls- bulls are going to look to find support at 380 which has been pretty major support in the past and we saw a tone of resistance at earlier this month. If bulls can hold 380 we may see a bounce to test resistance of the red dotted line at 390 tomorrow. They would then look for a bigger breakout towards 402 to fill that gap. 

Bears- overall the bears have taken control. I am seeing a very bearish pattern with the big green candle, potential hanging man and now a bearish fully engulfing candle. This 1-2-3 should bring further downside later this week and into next week. 380 will be the major support to break through and fromt here we will look for the next major support test of 370.

ES futures broke through their rising wedge today also. So far they will look to test their black dotted bull channel support at 3750 tomorrow if we get another massive red day if not looking at 3765 on Thursday. 

As you can see the ABCDE pattern is the same for ES futures with a target near 3500 by end of July which would play out perfectly for the falling wedge (red dotted) we are seeing on the daily chart too.

I mentioned the key falling wedge on the VIX I saw last night and today the bears reverse the VIX hard and actually broke the nearly two week only resistance (down trend) line of the VIX‚Ä¶ we are now working our way back up with next PT for VIX of 30.

Its also got a beautiful black downward channel with nearly 5 touches of resistance now too which is going to be key to watch. 

As you can see QQQ has a very similar ABCDE pattern which brings us to 230 by August‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/xwwq6hol9f891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1830845fecc63b31ab5f37a1b86045ff63e0a19

You guessed it! Apple is looking at a PT of 100-110 by august with the same ABCDE pattern and too has established a very impressive red bear channel‚Ä¶ Apple needs to break under 125 to negate the black bear channel though which will be very important to confirm more downside. 

Overall I am bearish for next month and will consider positioning long on something but most likely will continue to play intraday as I don‚Äôt trust this market. But here is a good place to position for a 340-360 bounce.

10% challenge-

Today was a great day. Just unfortunately ran out of BP and couldn‚Äôt get in on the fun anymore. But it was a great day. Those swing calls printed nicely for me in the AM (of course ran to 100% a few minutes after selling but I never thought we woulda popped like that). 

my UVXY calls came back from -70% to -35% so I mitigated that loss today.

Worse play of the day was actually a great play BUT I didn‚Äôt take profits‚Ä¶ I played the 384 bounce expecting us to hold that and revisit a higher PT but we rejected 8ema and broke lower. Took a loss there‚Ä¶ saw a nice 10% but didn‚Äôt take it like an idiot. High risk play that worked out just poorly executed.

How is this possible and what are the odds?

Neonode owns the patent to the swipe technology and launched the first touchscreen phone in 2002.

The phone had small success at the time and the company changed focus.

In the great patent war between #AAPL and #SMSN 2016 Samsung overturned a huge verdict based on patent invalidity.

From the ruling: Samsung presented two prior art references, the NeoNode N1 Quickstart Guide (‚ÄúNeonode‚Äù) from 2004 and a video and paper by Plaisant that were presented at a computer-human-interactivity conference in 1992. ‚ÄúWe reverse the judgment of infringement and no invalidity because the asserted claim of the ‚Äô721 patent would have been obvious in light of Neonode and Plaisant.

New management in Neonode contacted IP specialists Aequitas in 2019 to se if they had a case against Apple and Samsung. In 2020 they filed suit for IP Infringment on patent 993 and 879

Samsung and Apple joined suit and challanged the patent in sept 2020 in IPR - this process will either nullify the patent or give the Neonode side a huge win.

They used the same tacticts as samsung aginst apple - Prior art in other patents.

The IPR Board agreed on one patent 993 - the Patent is up for discussion. 879 stands! To be made unvalid on grounds of earlier patents A/S argues: Combination of Hisatomi / Ren or Hansen / Gillespie

Hisatomi 2002-02-20 Ren 2000/09 Hansen 1998-10-13 GIllespi 2002-04-17

Neonode have invention date 2002-12-19.It turns out have Neon had an ace up their sleeve.

Yesterday Neonode filed for discovery in Sweden and questioning of the inventor Magnus Goertz.

They searched for the originals of 3 documents already in their posseion all proving the invention took place around May 2001. This kills Apple/Samsungs prior art argument and makes the Patent stand on merit.

And for the trial and Jury in texas they want another document: The signed licensdeal with samsung from 2005 that samsung never paid.All documentation from discussion about licensing with APPLE from 2005-2010 These documents will prove the value of the technology in 2005 - probably higher then 1 $ per unit?

They will also prove without doubt that Apple and Samsung knew about the infringment

IF IPR stands their will be a Jury trial in Texas for Judge Allan albright or settlement

How do you think a Jury would react to the licensing deal?

Or samsungs defence against apple that the patent is owned p√• Neonode and NOT paying them a cent?

The optics of this case is spectacular and the risk reward extreme.Neonode is a company now producing touchless touch for elevators and kiosks. It is just ramping up after corona and probably will turn from loss to profit in 2022. The client list include NEC and Schindler.

Canada's technology sector has grown rapidly in recent years, as homegrown startups and foreign giants set about hiring hundreds of thousands of well-educated and talented workers. But that expansion has recently slowed to a crawl, as high inflation, interest rate hikes and a downturn for cryptocurrency have taken a lot of optimism out of the sector.

Chris Albinson, CEO of Waterloo-based incubator Communitech, says the pullback in the U.S. is more pronounced because there are more of what he calls ""go for the moon"" companies with dubious fundamentals suddenly finding themselves unable to adapt to the new reality.

Canadian tech companies are faring comparably better at the moment because generally speaking they are much better stewards of capital, he says, but that doesn't mean there isn't anxiety.

""There are some founders that were 18 years old when the last recession happened,"" he told CBC News. ""There's going to be stress on the system, but I think they're ultimately going to come out of that much stronger.""

Valuations for tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Apple and Netflix have cratered in recent weeks, and where once there was a fierce war for talent, many tech giants are implementing hiring freezes and even cutting staff.

U.S. streaming giant Netflix announced Thursday it's cutting another 300 jobs, the second time in as many months it has announced layoffs of that size.

Crowdsourced website layoffs.fyi has documented more than 20,000 tech job cuts in the past two months alone, mostly in and around major U.S. technology hubs like Seattle and San Francisco.

While cutbacks in Canada are less dramatic, they are happening.

Canadian financial tech unicorn Wealthsimple laid off 13 per cent of its staff last week, citing ""unprecedented"" levels of volatility in explaining the cut of roughly 160 positions. ""Many of our clients are living through a period of market uncertainty they've never experienced before,"" CEO and founder Michael Katchen told staff in announcing the news.",Technology layoffs show high-flying sector not immune from slowdown,1.0,2022-06-24 09:52:14

So, I‚Äôm minding my own business when this article falls into my feed. Seems like the future of EV‚Äôs is this new battery. 

Right now we‚Äôre heading into a recession, maybe depression (I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so I‚Äôve got no idea, looks bad in the short run though.) EV‚Äôs and going green to save the planet is being pushed on folks and the market isn‚Äôt quite ready for it, or it doesn‚Äôt seem so. 

Enter in the Lithium-sulphur battery. It‚Äôs lighter, less likely to explode, and has 3x the energy capacity of a lithium ion battery. Wrinkle brained folks at Drexel university discovered how to make this shit work by accident‚Ä¶ and like the apple falling from the tree on good ol‚Äô Sir Isaac Newton‚Äôs noggin, this accident will revolutionize our modern world.

Sulphur is easier to mine, easier to find, and less damaging to the environment to refine. Basically all of the negative hallmarks of a lithium ion battery are nill with a lithium sulphur battery.

 **Who can challenge Tesla?**  
Infinite game. Can the competitors play the infinite game; focusing on the long-term vision, able to move fast with aggressive investment rather than meeting short-term profitability and share price expectations?  

Incumbents versus startups. Can incumbents win against startups when the industry is moving towards the early phase of a new S-curve? History shows that it is difficult.

Capital allocation. We need to monitor their capital allocation between reinvestment versus dividends payout and share buybacks. Tesla and the startups are all reinvesting as much as possible and not into dividends and share buybacks which the incumbents were doing pre-Covid.

We are still early. Tesla‚Äôs challengers can be one of the current companies listed in this post. The challengers may exist in the form of a partnership where they work with various best-in-class (Apple, Nvidia, Mobileye, Cruise, Waymo).

I‚Äôve recently begun my plunge into the investing world and want to learn how to invest in a smart way. What do I need to look for in a company to want to start investing in them?

My first venture into the investing was during the initial GME craze. The whole volatility of that was pretty exciting. It‚Äôs made me want to really learn how to invest. 

Right now Im buying full shares, but is that a smart move or should I purchase a fraction of a share? I‚Äôve heard that some people read the trend-graphs of a stock to predict where it, in theory could go. Is that something anyone would really recommend? Ideally: I‚Äôd like to understand a company and invest from there. If I am to go that route, what are some key things I should look for in a company? Is it more so about stability, earnings/growth or more about the kind of products they are creating? Id assume it‚Äôs a bit of everything.

Companies like: Tesla, Microsoft and Apple come to mind as possible stock-buying opportunities. Im not sure where to start. Reading through different sites, most are recommending to invest in companies that are delving into VR space and psilocybin. However, should I only focus on a subset of stock or diversify my portfolio and buy kind of everything?

Are there any platforms/articles I could read that go report on the investing world? Id like to find something that discussed different companies and what they are doing, or how what they are doing could affect the market?

Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven‚Äôt seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% ‚Äî down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs.

Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.

Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has [plenty of advice](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/5-top-quotes-from-berkshire-hathaways-shareholder-meeting) on what to own when consumer prices spike.

In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.

Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.

## American Express (AXP)

Last year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695.

The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.

American Express makes most of its money through discount fees ‚Äî merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.

Business is booming. In Q1, the company‚Äôs revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion.

American Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire‚Äôs stake is worth nearly $24 billion.

Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.

American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%.

 

## Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola is a classic example of a [recession-resistant](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/jim-rogers-warns-big-collapse-and-recession) business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.

The company‚Äôs entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands ‚Äî including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater ‚Äî give it plenty of pricing power.

Add solid geographic diversification ‚Äî its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.

Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ‚Äô80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion.

You can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.

 

## Apple (AAPL)

No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.

Earlier last year, management revealed that the company‚Äôs active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones.

While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don‚Äôt want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.

Today, Apple is Buffett‚Äôs largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire‚Äôs portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple‚Äôs stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%.

Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.

 

## Chevron (CVX)

One of Buffett‚Äôs big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 ‚Äî a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.

Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.

It‚Äôs not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.

Oil ‚Äî the most heavily traded commodity globally ‚Äî has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by [Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/ukraine-invasion-protect-your-portfolio) could keep that trend going.

Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022.

The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%.","Warren Buffett says these are the best stocks to own when inflation spikes ‚Äî with consumer prices still surging, it's time to follow his lead - $CXV $AAPL $KO $AXP",1.0,2022-06-13 15:37:12

Q. Is the worst over?

* Tesla's stock which is down 31% for the year, crossed into ""Death Cross"" territory on 5/26/22 where it still lingers. But today, UBS upgraded Tesla to a ""BUY"" and giving **$TSLA** a price target of $1100.

Needless to say, where goes $AAPL; $MSFT; and $TSLA, goes the broader markets.

In this mix let's add AT&amp;T (**$T**) which entered the ""Death Cross"" way back on 7/21/21 and recently emerged victorious rising into the ""Golden Cross"" on 5/26/22.

For the first 3 hours of the day SPY maintained the same $3.1 range that was established within the first 30 minutes of trading. The best opportunity of the day was the 1230 dump. From there we just consolidated within a $2.35 range the rest of the day. Overall an extremely uneventful and extremely boring day to trade. Pretty much all but about 30 minutes of the day was untradeable.

When we look at the daily chart I think the party is about to be over. We have a couple things forming here. We have that blue triangle which you can see we peaked on June 2nd at 417.44. From there we have now established a lower highs resistance line that has been rejected 4 times including today. In addition highlighted in a red dotted pattern you can see a VERY large ascending wedge which I anticipate we will break tomorrow and will lead to the downfall where we will see a retest of the 390s at minimum over the next 2 or 3 weeks. 

We also maintained that purple channel that I believe we will eventually see support break on it and that will be the time to play some longer dated puts. I think that time is coming very soon. 

I fully expect us to revisit 408 support tomorrow at a minimum if not lower closer to 405. Currently 406.4 is the support line of the current sideways channel (406.4 to 416.6). 

https://preview.redd.it/5kiimo0jbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e03677135d5eb17c2df677918483e7ccb27d34

On the weekly we are seeing nearly a triple top (double top for sure) at 416. As long as SPY doesn‚Äôt close over 416 this week I fully anticipate the weekly to break that support line at 406.5 next week if not this week. 

https://preview.redd.it/stnadtzjbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a22e2d869d89f39e94443e26e044323df73c2ce0

I mentioned that the VIX was approaching its crucial support line yesterday in my TA and today I mentioned in my server that 23.8 was the key to watch. Well the VIX bounced right off 23.74 today and EOD failed to unwind back under 23.8 closing just below 24. 

https://preview.redd.it/o27nlenkbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286dc30095dd029ac5088285f7a5e2cc05b4bac7

I will be looking for the VIX to start its way back toward 30 tomorrow. With CPI coming only two days away now I suspect markets are going to start getting the fear back in. There has been a lot of chatter about this CPI and a lot from fed members to the point I think we are going to see a bigger miss then expect on CPI. I would be surprised to not see some of that fear set in tomorrow. I will be looking to see the VIX end of day near 25.5 and start its ascent up to 30 Friday and Monday next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/ojs3am9lbh491.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c202e0ad543621988fb095091d23f9d549e70354

Looking at the last few CPI releases you can see that surprisingly the last 4 of 5 CPI eves actually were green days with 2 of them being significantly green. However, the April 12th CPI we had a massively red day. Looking at the VIX trend For the April 12th CPI we actually saw the vix the week leading to CPI rise from 18.8 to 25. The May 11th CPI we saw the VIX go from 29 to 33 the day of CPI. Interestingly enough looking at the VIX trends 7days prior to CPI this is the first CPI we have seen the VIX unwind leading to CPI. We have over the last really month (actually the last CPI on May 11th) seen the VIX steadily unwind down to where we are not at 23.95. 

We have seen the VIX go from peak of 37 on May 2nd to current day at 23.95 and SPY has only gone from 380.54 (may 20th) to 417.44 (June 2nd) a 9.6% bull run. Oddly enough the same time it took the VIX to go from 34 (March 9th) to 24 (March 22nd) Spy also moved about 9% going from 415.12 to 450.58. 

I have two working theories. The first is that the fed and markets know CPI is finna be trash and its finna scare the fuck outta the market. We then have a follow up FOMC meeting only 3 trading days later. With these two major VIX spiking catalysts I have a theory that they purposefully have been slowly unwinding the VIX knowing come Friday, and next week the VIX is gonna rocket again and they don‚Äôt want the VIX over 40+ yet and they don‚Äôt want SPY back under 380 yet. 

My second theory is we are going to see a great CPI and a reassuring fed on Wednesday at FOMC. If that were to happen we could see the VIX unwind the rest of the way from 23 to 18 (just like the March rally and VIX unwind). 

In March we saw the VIX go from 34 on March 9th to 19 on March 29th which moved SPY from 415.12 to 462.07. 11.3%. If the VIX continues to unwind we could see the last 4% of the rally which would bring us up to 424 range. Oddly enough this tracks with one of my major daily resistance lines perfectly.

Do I think we see 424 at this point? No I really don‚Äôt. I really favor that we are going to get a CPI that‚Äôs comes in over expectations (currently consensus is 8.3%). 

Last CPI we saw them for the first time predict that inflation has essentially peaked saying we would see 8.1% instead of the previous 8.5%. We DID see a ‚Äúpeak‚Äù with a 0.2% decrease from 8.5% to 8.3%. They are now calling for that same number of 8.3%. Now if and when this CPI misses not only is it a miss of expectations its also confirming that inflation has NOT peaked which is a major deal. I predict we come in somewhere near 8.4-8.5%. 

In the off chance we DO see 8.2% or lower that would be a major catalyst for the markets though as it would confirm for 2 months in a row that inflation has ‚Äúpeaked.‚Äù Now of course in reality if we look at the world its bullshit there aint no way anythings peaked‚Ä¶ But of course they look at the numbers how they want to‚Ä¶ 

10% challenge-

Today was actually a GREAT day. I didn‚Äôt make my first trade till 1230 on that big drop. I stuck strictly 100% without wavering to my 5 of 5 in agreement momentum indicator and let me tell you she did not disappoint! It saved me from taking 3-4 trades that I would normally have entered. However, EOD when we were attempting to breakout during power hour it was showing 5 of 5 bullish. However, that‚Äôs where the overall trend of the day and relationship to the 8ema and comes into play hugely. IT was against trend so I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to enter the trade and im glad I didn‚Äôt as it obviously came back down‚Ä¶ 

My only red trade today was an apple trade I attempted to enter in congruence with my SPY trade at 1230ish. It never saw about 3% and I closed when I closed my SPY put for profits.

I decided to go ahead and enter some puts over night tonight. I think even if we open green that we will see at minimum 407 tomorrow intraday. However I favor us opening under the daily 8ema of 410.92 and braking down most of the day.

I like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:

I would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.

At the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.

Bulls are pretty much do or die here though as they are back at the support line. Markets stayed pinned almost all day from 1015 am between 412.2 and 409.9. That 409.9 support was hella strong and is something to watch next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gz7cffm70h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8eb70e04adf3bda2630e2c6b3ad82e42f364ac2

The daily is really tough to get a read on here. We held that key 409.5 support today which also means we once again held the daily 8ema which is seen as bullish. The daily 8ema is now confirmed above the daily 20ema. With yesterdays big green finish and the bullishly engulfing candle we very well should have seen 420s today. However, with that market FUD this morning we took a nose dive seeing our first 1.5% red day since May 18th. 

Seeing only one bull day followed up by a bear day we should suspect to see a follow up red day Monday based off the trend. 

Bull case- Bulls need a massive gap up Monday at open to maintain the integrity of the channel. The bulls would need to open near 412.5 in order to hold support of channel and from there see nothing but green. 

Bears as long as we open under 412.5 will see this channel support broken. From there they will look to tackle the 409.9 support that just did not want to break today.

The VIX maintains its downward trend since May 20th and as long as this downward trend continues their should be further upside for SPY. However, today the VIX pretty much just sputtered between 42.9 and 25.9 all day long. The VIX was very much so disconnected from the market today.

I don‚Äôt really speak on volume much in my nightly TA but intraday I heavily rely on VOLSPD and VOLD to guide my trades. Today pretty much all day long both made new lows over and over. When volume is that bearish SPY should be following. We also saw pretty aggressive sell pressure from pretty much open to close yet we did not have the type of follow through on SPY price action wise. Today was a very odd day intraday. Pretty much every candle inversed itself and there was no continuation of trends or candles. It was very choppy. There was 11 (the most ive seen yet) 180 reversals of price action today. With he VIX under 25 that‚Äôs unnatural that‚Äôs some VIX 30+ level stuff right there. Today overall was a very odd day. It seemed like the Markets were propping it up EOD that 409.9 should have been busted through easily.

QQQ actually looked extremely strong today despite the rest of the market and actually still has its GAP to be filled from 300.92 to 302.42. 

There is a very likely scenario where we see these both filled on Monday which would mean SPY will break through that 409.9 support. 

Overall I usually have a sense of direction going into the next week but I really have no idea where they are going to take this next week.

Looking at the last few CPI you can see the two days leading up to the release of CPI have historically been VERY bearish especially if you look at the May and April release dates. Also the last 4 CPI release days have been a red day themselves. The way these fed members have been speaking this weak I am not expecting a beat at all on this CPI. I highly expect it to be a big miss. 

10% challenge-

I went into today with secured weekly profits. I got impatient and made a very costly trade on calls in the morning on one of the fake outs. From there it just never quite got better. I made an EOD put trade that I failed to secure profits on out of pure greed thinking that we would FINALLY break through 409.9 and ended up closing if for a fairly large loss. Through good and through bad im here and im transparent with you guys. Today was a bad day for me. But I look forward to money and starting fresh with a full 5 days. I don‚Äôt need to make up for these losses all on Monday. I have plenty of time to do that.

What‚Äôs up degenerates. Strap in because we are about to go to the moon and drill for some fucking space water.

Before I start my thesis let me quickly say that throughout history one thing has always stood true, people need food and water. Now one of these is much more iterated upon than the other. Not all good is similar some can be spicy some can be savory some can even be saucy. But drinks, drinks that keep you alive all have one thing in common. Water.

Water is the most important commodity in the world. I don‚Äôt give a fuck what anyone else says. Water drives economies because it drives people who in turn.. you get the point. Now, when I came to this brilliant thought that definitely no one else has ever had, I realized I needed to get in on the Water shit. Queue me googling up ‚Äúwater stonks‚Äù. Now to save you about 15 min of boring reading and 5 min of clicking out of pop up ads the basic understanding in this game of water stocks is you can invest into an individual company that deals with water acquisition (think equivalent of Apple in tech) or you can invest in the big boy ETF (less risk hopefully y‚Äôall know what an ETF is). Now the biggest problem when you look at water sticks is the lack of volume in the industry to make sizable changes and have a reliable way to get out of trades. But that won‚Äôt stop me and it shouldn‚Äôt stop you.

Unless you are under a rock the American west and many parts of the world have been under and massive fucking drought for the last like 20 years in a row and basically are having to rethink the way they get and manage water in their municipalities. Now this sets up the companies who have a large stake already in the water game for some massive fucking deals. These companies have no reason to settle for shit rate deals with these states. In fact I speculate that the water market will soon explode due to the inequality in supply and demand. And when this happens there will be a reckoning for these companies as the governments in these areas exert there force. But until then I don‚Äôt see any way but up.

As good as the show was, the creators took some real liberties in fabricating the dinosaurs actions and motives. The narrator spoke about the dinosaurs with certainty as if he personally observed them doing the things they did in the show. When it came to the T-Rex mating habits, for example, the narrator said, ‚ÄúOnce he finds his mate, for the next several weeks, they‚Äôll engage in sexual activity‚Ä¶ frequently.‚Äù How does this narrator know that T-Rexes were fuckin‚Äô for weeks straight? We‚Äôve never observed this in nature. But the narrator spoke so definitively and emphatically that I couldn‚Äôt help but believe him even if what he was saying may have been completely inaccurate. 

Li Auto‚Äôs egomaniac CEO, Li Xiang, has been doing this since his company‚Äôs IPO in 2020. This Chinese scam company IPO‚Äôd at the height of EV mania in the summer of 2020, yet miraculously, it‚Äôs still up almost 60% since its debut. It‚Äôs now valued at laughable ~$26B. The best part - this utterly shitty ‚ÄúEV‚Äù company doesn‚Äôt even make EVs. It makes one vehicle called the Li One and it‚Äôs actually just a regular hybrid that costs $50,000+. 

Li Xiang ironically dubbed his company ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Toyota‚Äù. Li Auto doesn‚Äôt have a world-class assembly line nor incredible reliability like Toyota. In fact, Li Auto actually suffers from seriously shoddy craftsmanship, a notoriously unreliable suspension system, vehicle fires, etc. The cars are junk. Li Auto is known for putting out some of the worst automotive quality in all of China. Li Xiang created this ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Toyota‚Äù moniker because he makes his employees fly coach. Literally, he‚Äôs on record saying his company will be the next Toyota because of his frugality in regard to business travel. Meanwhile, Li Auto recently significantly cut its 2022 sales targets, the Chinese government is currently discussing removing Li Auto‚Äôs subsidies altogether because they aren‚Äôt capable of building a real EV, Chinese consumer demand is dwindling, and supply chain issues persist in a massive way.

Nio,¬†Xpeng, Byd, Geely, Toyota, Tesla, BMW, VW and multiple different state-owned Chinese auto manufacturers are all direct competitors of Li Auto. To go along with its huge amount of competitors and its increasingly poor reputation as a manufacturer of bad quality vehicles, there has been speculation that Li Auto fabricated its meager ~10,000 deliveries in 2020. 

I think Xpeng is terribly overpriced too, but Li Auto is a true horror show of a company. This company isn‚Äôt worth $4B yet somehow it‚Äôs valued at $26B. Take that for what it‚Äôs worth.",Li Auto will be joining the T-Rex in extinction.,1.0,2022-06-01 03:13:39

Very low volume, fairly significant swings based off literally only AAPL. Now I‚Äôm only 12, but I know the signs of waning liquidity when I see it. However, there was a single stock that stood out from the the rest: $GEO

Now let me clarify that private prisons are the epitome of evil, and I do not give a damn that Mitchell Blueberry bought it. The analysis I did over the course of 10 minutes told me one thing: This play cannot go tits up. 

It‚Äôs fairly simple. GEO has a dickton of Short Interest. SI almost double M/M from 17.34% to 33.05%. More importantly, the Short Ratio sits at 9.99. For those of us regards, that means it will take 10 trading days for shirts to cover. 

Now in a vacuum, this could be seen as just a shitty stock that the feds are shorting. However, today Wedbush upgraded GEO from neutral to outperform &amp; raised their PT from $10 to $14. The stock proceeded to piss missile from +16.23% from $10.23 to $11.89. 

I watched it throughout the day, expecting an eventual mean reversion. From 11am to 12pm, it fell from $11.64 to $11.28, and I figured it was done. But no. It recovered. When it cleared $11.50 and kept running, I knew it was game on. After all, the shorts have at minimum 9 more days to cover. 

Position: 50 Dec 16 $13c &amp; 50 Jan 20 $14c. 

Tl;dr: GEO massively shorted, shorts can‚Äôt cover quickly enough, 80% a of shares are owned by institutions, and those chodes are going to rush to cover. It‚Äôs math.

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

Last week was almost Perfect, we almost got everything on the watchlist right on the money, no one can get all their plays perfectly obviously so the weeks where we do is cause for celebration at least for me.

For Earnings, we had $ZM puts, $DE puts, and $BBY calls. All ran in the direction we hoped for 100%-200% plays, except DE.

As for economic plays, we only had FOMC minutes and as expected, we got a little pump. I have zero clue why anyone on Twitter and Reddit would be bearish on minutes for a meeting that already happened and we say a dovish statement for. But each to his own, we made our $$$.

For those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  
**Port % Change:** 1101%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts.

Cashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out.

Averaged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March ‚Äò23 swing.

As we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.

So overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C
* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C
* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C
* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C
* TSLA 03/17/2022 220.00 C

Man last week was sleepy but this week is FULL of data, SUPER IMPORTANT data as well. Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.

**GDP Q3**

So we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.

This month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.

With USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts

**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**JPow Speech**

JPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.

A lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.

I think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.

**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**PCE**

Now we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.

**JPow play:  SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

I'm still long NFLX as long as it holds the upward trendline, if I see a clear failure of the line, will be exiting my position, but if it holds, will add more. From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.

https://preview.redd.it/0vaafsrxmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dcc6795c04099a286f3027b76883bc088928996

**- AAPL Long**

Has been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target

https://preview.redd.it/dvy6evpymo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496a4a6a6a31afe0aae0c1fc2d20e095c13e4709

**- TSLA Long**  
We got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week

https://preview.redd.it/mstw3cizmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c6cc55ed54d5d42911f8bf050743b74e73df37

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

My 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move.

I‚Äôll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.

If my assumptions are correct with this week‚Äôs events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i‚Äôll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p

https://preview.redd.it/xr65x390no2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=416cb8e5a7401db4cc374a26d62efc4024460e4d

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week‚Äôs play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

If you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.

 TA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200-day MA SPY, FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \~3490, sentiment,  inversion of the yield curve, upcoming recession, risk-free rate changing, etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally (and tells me this is just a bear market rally). Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on. 

Watchlist for downside:

Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on.

I am short 

NFLX

CMG

GS

My only long position is $ASTS right now, which I trimmed today bigly.

**But be aware, I will scale in and out of these short positions on a whim. I have a HUGE short/long watchlist, and if I sense there is money to be made elsewhere I will rotate my money.**

Stuff on my watchlist

$COIN

$AAPL

$TSLA

$TMUS

$CAT

$DE

$LI

and a ton of other stocks.

This is not financial advice, this is for the people curious about what my next move is. 

Also, I don't recommend anyone to short as the asymmetry is against you when shorting. Your losses can be infinite, while your gains are capped at 100% (unless using leverage). Good luck my fellow brethren.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words.

Before I explain my thought process, here are a few trades I‚Äôve entered these last few weeks:

**$GM long on OCT 17 at $33.42, now at $38.85. A 16.24% move.**

You can check out more of my past trades on my website [Foolproofoptions.com](http://foolproofoptions.com/)

Now, back to my analysis.

My analysis is based on TA only, the chart tells me everything I need to know.

**$SPY to $411**

$SPY had a huge resistance at $379.46 on the 3-week chart, it broke on Tuesday and got retested on Thursday. As you can see in the chart it bounced on the re test.

The next resistance/ support level to watch is $389. Which is the level it closed on Friday.

If $SPY closes above this level on hourly chart on Monday. That could be a great entry.

The previous 3-week candle on SPY was a hammer candle. Which signals a reversal back to the previous 3-week-high. $411.

**$QQQ to $311**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5raskxyzosw91.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72849b2994a967469aebe507ccd10191e622999a

$QQQ has a huge resistance at $284. Every time it touches that level, it goes back down.

But now. $AAPL is breaking out, the next resistance level for $AAPL is $164.

https://preview.redd.it/qknxogk1psw91.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=809a68f3918d33032edc19a24eb02cbbd5dc3a2e

Which means $QQQ will most likely follow all the way to it‚Äôs next resistance level.

I expect $QQQ to hit $311 within the next 3-4 weeks.

I will open my $QQQ trade after it breaks and confirms above $284.60 on the hourly chart.

**$XLK to $139**

$XLK had a hammer candle on the 3-week chart, signaling a reversal back to its previous 3-week candle‚Äôs high which is $139.

https://preview.redd.it/cb3b7ot2psw91.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87fec9d537b09f26237bcbc310d3fcbc5d76f739

It had a huge resistance at $128, which was broken on Friday.

I expect $XLK to hit $139 within the next 3-4 weeks.

**How To Trade It:**

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the trades I‚Äôm taking.

I will be using debit spreads. With debit spreads I can double my money with a very small move in the underlying. Debit spreads also reduce the effect of Theta, which is very great.

**For $SPY, I plan to take the 389/392 call debit spread expiring on NOV 27. At $1.50.**

If $SPY closes above $392 on NOV 27 I make 100% on my money.

**For $QQQ, I plan to take the $281/$283 call debit spread expiring on NOV 27. At $1.00.**

If $QQQ closes above $283 on NOV 27, I make 100% on my money.

**For $XLK, I plan to take the 129.5/132 call debit spread expiring on NOV 27.**

If $XLK, closes above $132 on NOV 27, I make 100% on my money.

Depending on market conditions. I will most likely take profits when the stocks hit my price target and will not wait until NOV 27 close.

Stocks are moving like cryptos lately, and I like to play it safe.

The analysts' rating of AAPL is trash. Only .58% returns in a year? What a rookie! Taking a deeper dive into their ratings and predictions, most of these gards put buy ratings at the top of a spike and right before the gay bears came to town!

It gets worse for AMZN! These gards are still giving advice when their track record for the past year is -30%!!!

The volumes and open interest of calls for AAPL and AMZN is also pretty high vs the volume and OI on puts!

[AAPL 1](https://ibb.co/3hzb6L7)

1. Rightnow we have 3 quarters of aapl earnings and this final quarter earnings gives us the entire 2022 year. The street is estimating something around 89b but what I am showing on the right side is a few different options. So for example: If the quarter has a 5% growth in revenue, that would imply that our entire year revenue growth was about 7%. So that is how this reads.

[AAPL 2](https://ibb.co/9ZtcSy6)

2. So this chart is showing aapl growth YOY. As you guys can see the trend is looking weaker and  
into the single digit revenue growth

[AAPL 3](https://ibb.co/P992h87)

3. These tables are showing AAPL Net income broken down into quarters and year. Take a look at  
2020 net income vs 2021 net income. Massive massive gains also amazing how in the last 3  
quarters, aapl has surpassed their 2021 net income

[AAPL 4](https://ibb.co/dMhQfcP)

4. This next chart shows several data points on PE multiples with outliers removed As you can see,  
we are well above what the average is

People pay high PE multiples for companies that have high revenue growth. What's concerning to  
me is that we're seeing a clear slowdown in their revenue growth and many headwinds and yet  
price is still very strong.

I think there's nothing wrong with the company, but I think given the macro economic situation, I think investors might be paying too much right now.

Buyers main objective is to first attempt a breakout from the daily balance and then attack the weekly balance. Buyers would prefer to hold above 3740 and not let sellers find acceptance back within the weekly value, to demonstrate strength. The most favorable scenario for buyers is to find acceptance above the weekly balance which would target 3880, where we have MA50, and the Weekly Extreme High 3935. Sellers want to negate that scenario by being responsive at the upper end of the balance areas. The first downside target would be the monthly VPOC 3690 and in case we break and hold below, 3650 and the Weekly Extreme Low 3590 comes into play. Note that we closed at the highs of the 5 day balance, meaning initiative buyers are needed fairly quickly or simply the lack of them would attract selling activity.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.",2022-10-24 Better Tasting Crayons (Mathematically derived options plays),1.0,2022-10-24 00:41:03

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Another day of big reversals on Wall Street, with stocks posting their best week since June after a treasury rout stalled. The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It‚Äôs important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It‚Äôs do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

You'll better read it before this one because I won't repeat any intro or info explanations ( I'm lazy af)

if you're looking for an essay about nothing, then you may wanna check r/stocks

[chart 1: short\/long ratio ](https://preview.redd.it/k8m382ov7eq91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61372c3cb82d5f3cba7e225414f4813677d9dd23)

COT report data: [https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm)

chart 1: MM= market makers, HF= hedge funds

In my first analysis I talked about the COT report and the fact that hedge funds were extremely net short: I was expecting 408 as the top of the last bear market rally for multiple reasons, but it actually topped at 430

 The chart 1 shows how MM were positioned for the first dump at SPY ATH

after the first bear market rally HF were net short (3.2) but then they closed most of their short positions, prob they weren't expecting the long donwtrend... meanwhile MM short ratio was stable but still high

after the second minor bear market rally ( flat channel/ were QT formally started) HF loaded short positions (2.4) and then they took profit during the dump (1.6)

MM short ratio has been stable at lower levels, while they loaded a crazy amount of long positions during the flat formation and especially during the third bear market rally (chart 2 /1)

hedge funds did exactly the opposite: they started accumulating short positions from the bottom (chart 2/1), short ratio went from 2 to 4.9

\*meantime institutionals positioning has been stable during the whole year, apparently they just try to stay market neutral (chart 2/A)

from SPY 410 to 430, HF loaded up on spread positions (long + short) (chart 2/B), they expected a final pump so they hedged themself

as soon the market dumped from 430, HF took profits: ratio went from 5.7 to 4.3 (chart 2/3) and they added some several spread positions (chart 2/2) = they expected the last mini rally, and it actually happened

[chart 2: COT report](https://preview.redd.it/hw94jgzmbeq91.jpg?width=1639&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33cad8bba2b6bdfd3a2e52d4c7f424d6c63ea08b)

now, the last COT report shows how HF closed the biggest amount of short positions of the entire year (chart 2/3) and MM closed all spread positions they've opened during the last dump (to hedge themself since they were still bullish, ratio was 0.4) (chart 2/4)

from my point of view this means that they're not positioned for a real crash in the short term, also, HF are still holding a lot of spread positions (chart 2/5) to cover themself from another momentum rally

&amp;#x200B;

[chart 3: SPX 1d](https://preview.redd.it/nbmwsij80fq91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d23cc751a09828dec05d44a7545832766ab48da3)

The first major major bear market rally ended +11% vs last one +16%, thanks to AAPL at almost ATH ( at some point it weighted 7.3%, highest in SPY history)

the last bear market rally ended  at 430 resistence( from May price action) into the lowest volume zone of the year (chart 4), that was a real signal for the upcoming dump...

after those rallies both downtrend are structured through the same standard deviations, up 2.5 / down 2 (not trendlines)

In the first downtrend every momentum rally (from 1/4h RSI oversold) ended as soon it touched the upper deviation: 3 mini rallies, meanwhile in the current downtrend we only had 1 rally...  

the last rally ended into the 410 resistence, which is also the POC of the volume profile (red line), Fibo 0.5 (Fibo retracements work perfectly though this downtrend)and same RSI levels as the flat channel QT structure

HF short/long ratio was higher than 2020 = 5.9 (chart 1)

the dump was so predictable as I warned in the daily thread...

[chart 4: SPY volume](https://preview.redd.it/ehuofawpbeq91.jpg?width=979&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c835417023dc68ea54c4bd610a8bdfb5370b77be)

**SPECULATIVE CONSIDERATIONS**

As I mentioned at the beginning HF are not positioned for a flash crash, either a major rally so I expect the market to complete the well known pattern ""pump then dump again"" to crush most of call/puts at short term

[chart 5: SPX 4h](https://preview.redd.it/pex3fwrcugq91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bcf8772587e0df4700a6694d58ae44a7b0c4c7)

The market is gonna take some days (at 4H RSI oversold) to complete the donwward  or flat consolidation before the pump (+4/5%) to the upper deviation 380, it will give the impression of a  SPY double bottom... then dump again -7% (as the other dumps) to 350 (Fibo retracement) (chart 5)

Last SPY bottom is not a real resistence, it was just a fakeout back then. The real resistence was SPY 372/374 (from 2021) where the market bounced on the 9.1 CPI day with a tremendous V reversal, then started the major rally

the market broke that resistence with a gap down like nothing

At the end it will be a -18% correction from the last top, same % as the first downtrend

Market will be oversold on the weekly RSI at 350 = flat consolidation + major bear market rally 

And as I exposed in the first post, market has never broken the 30 weekly RSI since Covid flashcrash and 2008, it takes a real black swan.

Also, the TINA effect (There Is No Alternative) for big money will pump the market again +10/15%... I will expose it in the next post.

Now, for the sake of pessimism (üåàüêª), let's imagine ASTS and their partners decide to sell at a much lower price and ASTS gets half. Say 20$ per GB, so ASTS gets 10$. And again for the sake of pessimism (üåàüêª), let's say they sell only 10% of their capacity.
 
Once the full constellation is up (likely before 2030) that means a yearly revenue of 10$x168satsx1.8M GBx12 monthsx10% = **3.63B$**

Yeah, *that's fucking right* **.** My üåàüêª case is 3.63B$ per year for a constellation that will cost about the same only once to build. They may *very well* be able to sell *a lot more* at a *much higher* price. I'll let you do the math and come up with stupidly high valuations by yourselves.
 
If we give that a 10 years valuation that's 36B$. Currently stock is trading at 10.76$ with a 1.97B$ market cap. 
 
That means a 2030 share price of **196.7$** or 18.3 times today's price share.
 
So here's the bet. **&gt;**18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.
 
Position: Long shares, warrants, 2024 leaps, and other calls.

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover

* Last week's plays and what I learned from them
* This week‚Äôs Earnings
* This Week's Major Economic Events
* This week‚Äôs Watchlist
* This Week‚Äôs lotto 10 bagger Play

There is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all this, so you can check that out if you don't like reading

Ok so let's get this show on the road

So we had 12 Plays Last Week in chronological order as they unfold

(2 No plays - 7 Wins - 3 Losses)

**$SPX dump at Open:** Went exactly as planned grabbed SPX next day puts  PM, on the pump, the market opened to a huge dump, 300%+ play.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$SPX relief rally:** Also as expected after the dump, SPX bounced off  390.6 level and as per the plan we closed my SPX Friday calls before JPow Speech at the 4000ish level, 150%+ play  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**

**$DWAC** Was a little late on this one as it was 20% down in the PM already before open. Got in after the pop at the open, when it hit the 200MA.At one point we were up 50%. But news came out before market close that the vote was delayed and the sponsor will loan them the money for an extension causing it to pump.Luckily it lost all gains the next day PM and i still held the puts. It pumped after they delayed the meeting again and puts went to 0. I'm not done with this turd, will be back for it in October for the meeting.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Getting in late is one of the first obvious mistakes. Not following my rule for selling above 50% is the second mistake. Not taking a second chance to get out of my puts was the 3rd mistake. Will need to apply my basic trading rules more strictly, got swept up in 10x potential.

**$SAVA** Absolute beast ran 15% from where we got in, but I got leaps so profit is nothing too crazy up 30% so far, but green is green.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Should have added some short-term calls, as it was getting alot of traction on reddit

**$GTLB** Beat earnings, revenue &amp; Guidance, yet still dropped in the PM. No reasons for this to happen, but this is the nature of earnings. Recovered by the open, but offcourse IV crush took 50% off its value. Averaged down at the open. Then it ran, as it should have, up 8.5% where I sold for a small 10% profit. Better than being right and selling at a loss I guess.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Should have held longer, ran up alot more for the rest of the week up 20%+ from earnings, should have placed a stop loss and let it run

**$NIO** This was straight up a bad call, missed EPS and guidance, it ran after market open went up 3%, sold for 20$ profit. I GOT LUCKY, this was a bad call.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** I mostly relied on sparse options flow for direction, it has a low PPS, likely most action would have been in shares action, not options, which were clearly selling off.

**$GME** Bought puts on Tuesday, and it just kept selling off, was up 75%ish so had to take profits. Sold and rebought with profits after it pumped a little for earnings. Got killed on earnings puts went to zero, earnings missed as expected but pumped on FTX partnership  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Stock has lots of supporters who buy the stock on any kind of news, puts would have worked if they were long-term, as it should dump hard if the market goes down.

**$SPX Dump after Jpow Speech:** We got a dump at 4017ish resistance, where i picked up puts as per plan BUT it very quickly rebounded and kept going up till stop loss hit, made 50% on this one.  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$DOCU:** Not much to say here, everybody was expecting a miss, but they didn't, puts went to 0  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$KR:** Beat earnings, didn't run too much even with a bullish market, made 15%, not bad  
**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \-

**$MSFT $AAPL** Took no plays, no triggers activated

Ok so now that we have last week wrapped up and behind us, This week is going to be pretty damn exciting with CPI numbers coming out, so we have to be prepared.

# Earnings this week that I will play

But before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time

How I play earnings:

* buy shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes
* lotto size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don‚Äôt go over 5% size on any earning‚Äôs play
* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad

So now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it

**Earnings**

**Monday 12 Sep 22**  
After Close - Oracle Corp. - $ORCL

* World's largest database management company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $1.07 &amp; Revenue $11.3B
* Unusual Options: The $75.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 1.37 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings
* My play: Not gonna lie I can't decide on this one, data/chart seems very neutral, leaning more towards puts here, taking a very small position here.

**Thursday 15 Sep 22**  
After Close - Adobe Inc. - $ADBE

* Packaged software company
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $3.334 &amp; Revenue $4.443B
* Unusual Options: $390.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 9.93 16Sep Expiry
* Options pricing in a 7.5% move on earnings
* The stock was down 14 days in a row, before getting a dead cat bounce
* My play: 23sep 395c going with the flow here on this one, with $DOCU beat, a beat here seems likely too

So this wraps up the earnings for this week, I bought last week this time to avoid high premiums from IV spikes, remember lotto size only

# Major Economic Events

We are going into CPI with a VERY interesting, very bearish SPY hourly chart. We are right at 200MA, we have a very overbought RSI, that remained overbought all of Friday, and we have a big gap that is yet to be filled.

https://preview.redd.it/9pu4yjw5y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa29a540e4f60fb1417966169bc801c324ecfdf

From a trend point of view, we are at a very critical level. For the market to continue its downward trend it needs to make a lower high here. If it breaks this level, this is no longer a relief bounce and we have a reversal on our hands.

https://preview.redd.it/gj2r0pu6y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f0dcede9e90b6e7e95dee8da72889f8679f952

From a technical standpoint, everything points to sell off on CPI print. If that is the case the game plan here are some scenarios and how to play them:

1. Good CPI Read: We can see a sell-off all the way down to fill the gap, cooling off the chart. Then a retest of the 200MA, trapping shorts and triggering a squeeze. In which case our first take profit target is 401.2 at or before the gap fills on the way down.After gap fills, We have the 21MA between the gap fill and 200MA, if it rebounds and breaks 21MA then we should switch to calls. If it fails to break 21MA and falls back then puts are still in play.
2. Good CPI Read: We can see a big sell-off Sunday overnight all the way to CPI red on Monday AM, to reset the charts and then pump back up. In which case we would just take calls after CPI read
3. Bad CPI Read: We can see a sell-off and a hard reject off 200MA like we did in August and a free fall all the way to the 50MA, in that case, I would place my stop above the gap fill level and move it down as we keep falling, first take profit target at 50MA

https://preview.redd.it/oosxz008y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e362e872c975517f0b17098a1c9c456a72bf8da

I don't see a scenario where we don't dump to reset the charts at the very least, that's why I took a starter position of Sep14 SPX 3990p on Friday. And will be religiously taking profits and managing stop losses.

The rest of the week is where it gets very tricky, why? These are the last 5 CPI reads and what happened afterApr. 12, 2022 (Tues) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week

May 11, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Jun. 10, 2022 (Fri) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week

Jul. 13, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week

Aug. 10, 2022 (Wed) - Pumped on CPI read day and pumped for the rest of the week

As you can see the data is very inconclusive, as matter of fact it seems to be alternating every month, so if this trend continues we should reverse whatever happens on the CPI read day, for the rest week. Offcourse this is not reliable so we won't be looking at that for direction.

Luckily since we are at pivotal levels, I expect an overall follow-through, last 2 CPI reads showed inflation decreasing, we are actually expecting, deflation for august at -0.01% read and the headline read of 8.1%.

https://preview.redd.it/6rpu4pfay7n91.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9550ccaa78dcb53e08ac18bd1a7f447271d2550c

At or below these levels and 75bps is off the table completely which is what the market has already priced in. Not only will we pump this week, but we will also probably pump for the rest of Q4 22, as fed pivots in Q1 23. If you see these numbers or below, you might want to get yourself some calls, cause we are pumping hard.

If you see anything above these numbers prepare yourself for a new low this year and load up on puts. We have:

**Monday 09/12**

08:30 AM CPI/Inflation Rate Aug

**Tuesday 09/13**

08:30 AM PPI Aug

**Wednesday 09/14**

08:30 AM Retail Sales MoM Aug  
08:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims MoM Aug

**Thursday 09/15**

10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment Sep

I'm leaning towards a drop and pump but no need to guess here, we have our levels and plays ready.

# Watchlist

**$NVDA** has a small gap to fill up to $149.8, if the market continues its run on Monday this gap could fill and would take Calls at open if the market is bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/bcw2djfcy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51cfd2ae890782af83646dc37af1807a10ccab08

**$TSLA** has been going sideways for a while now and we are at a pivotal level, should make a big move whichever way the market breaks, if sentiment is bullish and we can break $315 expect a move to $364 quickly. If the market is bearish, we go back quickly to 50MA, lose that and $207 is my next target

https://preview.redd.it/aq0zbuady7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360ce4bd6b83a37d3c174c140135fa6141854930

**$UPST** is another gap fill play to $30, that's a 15% move from current prices. Same-week calls would print hard if the market is bullish

https://preview.redd.it/ujxh8m6ey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f70bfe2292752888cf3f7b904322fbaac87807

**$QQQ** if the market trend is bearish after CPI while everything will fall, the biggest losers will be tech stocks. I will be loading QQQ puts here if the market sentiment is bearish

https://preview.redd.it/jkqz99xey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6738acf2da414a7382de7c54aadaa97540ba9ab

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

  
**$NFLX -** This play is only valid if the market trend is bullish, we have a $100 gap to fill from here. We have been channeling between $217 and $249 for the last 2 months, sooner or later this gap will fill. Once we break out of the channel, the gap could fill in 2-3 days. We have 2 scenarios for when the gap would fill, but both would require the market trend to be bullish.

https://preview.redd.it/j1i6s9fgy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1406fe8ebea6c658e3baf944283f9791c14a2936

1. The market is bullish starting at CPI all the way through FOMC, we can see the gap fill
2. We get great earnings on 17Oct and gap fills

In all cases looking at the chart, this gap is begging to get filled. This is a 10+-bagger opportunity, but market conditions will dictate the timing of the play.  If we dump on CPI we can revisit the play in October.

If the market is bullish, im getting Oct28 260c and Sep30 245c, even if doesn't gap fill, big market run should push NFLX up alot. Risk to Reward is excellent on this play, as long as it fulfils our criteria.

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week‚Äôs play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

1109,1662754961,xa5ikj,1,"Way back in 2012, WSB had actual DD written up by actual traders. Yes, there were always memes and loss pr0n, but the circus monkeys hadn't quite overrun the circus yet. Then a fellow, I forget his username, wrote a post about why he was buying calls ahead of an AAPL earnings release. He had  figured out that AAPL was a good company -- this was controversial at the time -- but his logic was profoundly stupid. He seemed enamored with how AAPL could increase EPS while having decreased Earnings. But he made a lot of money and his post got a lot of attention.

Then a few months later, he decided that AAPL was done and decided to short. What changed? Seemingly nothing. The mind of a circus monkey was indecipherable. His posts once again gained him notoriety, so he live streamed his trades. I never watched them, but the description painted a rather vivid picture of a dystopian reality tv show. Stephen King's The Running Man came to mind.

He lost a lot of money. And his stupidity put him on the front page of Reddit and he was the subject of actual articles in actual news publications. More circus monkeys joined WSB by the tens of thousands. But even still, your typical WSBer knew it was all in good fun. The mostly sane majority laughed and looked down upon the circus monkeys.

Then DFV wrote up his DD. His tremendous work made him millions, garnered national news, and created a cult out of being a circus monkey. These cultists thought that the game was rigged and that buying stock in that particular company was the best way to fight the corruption. They may have succeeded in bankrupting a hedge fund or two, but mostly these cultists pulled the same trick that circus monkeys always pull: they lost money. 

The press has moved on and DFV has stopped posting, but the cultists are still out there. They believe -- like Haley's Comet -- that the Mother of All Short Squeezes is coming.  And the circus monkeys of WSB have spread like a cancer to other investing subreddits. Instead of sane people laughing at the circus monkeys, there is now only more circus monkeys. Laughing and throwing their shit at each other.

DOCU is one of the Covid stocks that has already fallen alot (75% YTD) but it still sports a P/S of 5 on a negative GAAP operating margin and EPS. This segment has very low barrier of entry and cost of changing to a competitor. There are very strong (potential) competitors that can leverage huge platform effects (MSFT, AAPL, ADBE etc.). Currently DOCU has very attractive gross margins which likely will be eroded by competition. If they cannot be GAAP positive now, it will only get worse.

Growth is slowing substantially, so far the CAGR and YoY growth numbers look quite but soon will deteriorate based on recent quarters. If the growth trajectory has slowed further in Q2 which is likely, the stock will drop.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth:**

Top line growth has almost halted over the last months, down to only $8m in Q1 FY23. Moreover, Billings which take into account contract liabilities have declined in Q3 FY22 and Q1 FY23 already.

[The bar chart on the right is not to scale. Source: Docusign investor relation presentation](https://preview.redd.it/1mav8mi0ucm91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26c83d624e98262ceaa35bc555ea41ec200c1a)

Customer Growth has decelerated substantially, only growing 6% in Q1

&amp;#x200B;

**Profitability**

DOCU sports very high non-GAAP Gross Margins of &gt;80%. While this is an impressive number, it is not surprising as it sells a pure non-customized SAAS solution. Currently DOCU benefits from a very advantageous marketing approach where it charges customers on a per-signature model. A key risk is that competitors may offer a flatrate model which would offer six or seven figure savings to large MNC customers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7jwsgj1ovcm91.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dda1929caa241f2a79346796de2978f29522769

DOCU is FCF positive

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3kq8ilq1wcm91.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c82b314909d08ca2f54b773d8dbb8ccecc3b364e

However the core issue is stock based compensation and other cost that Management excludes in Non-GAAP results. overall, this results in negative GAAP operating margins

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dj6up53jwcm91.png?width=1447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589881588f3a06a91b28126b850b1c6d574ad74e

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion DOCU currently is investing heavily in growth on a steeply diminishing returns basis. It seems that customer acquisition cost are increasing rapidly and Sales is consuming most of the FCF generated by the business

&amp;#x200B;

**Stock based compensation (SBC)**

in 2021 DOCU paid its employees ca. 245m SBC while this has increased to 350m in FY 2022. In Q1 FY23, SBC has increased to 95m which results in a minimum of 380m if Headcount &amp; compensation stays flat. However, HC has increased 25% over FY 22 so it can be expected that growth will continue and thus SBC.

SBC is a helpful tool to manage cash burn for a growth company with expanding market capitalization and rising stock price. However, on declining market cap it poses additional dilutive downward pressure on stock price. 

Example: 

At the current market cap of ca. 10bn, an annualized SBC of 500m will represent a dilution of 5%. The same SBC would have only meant a 1% dilution one year ago when the market cap was circa 50bn. Should the stock decline further towards 5bn, SBC will dilute by 10%.

**Summary:**

While DOCU is as fundamentally profitable (non-GAAP) venture without debt and a robust balance sheet. Currently it is the leader in this field, however the hurdles of entry are low and competitors like MSFT could offer the product as part of their existing platform (MS Office) which would make DOCU obsolete for many customers. 

Further, it seems the current pricing model where customers pay per signature seems very advantageous for DOCU as the marginal cost of each signature tends to be zero. However, it can be expected that competitors will offer flatrate models (as is customary with more mature SAAS solutions) which will put high margin pressure on DOCU.

Therefor I rate this a sell. I will open a short position today as I expect this stock to trend towards a 5bn valuation which would put it at a 25 FY22 FCF multiple. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**:

The company is not fundamentally flawed and could convert into a profitable business if Sales and SBC cost are managed. 

The company is still relatively small with 2bn revenue and may be able to recover its growth trajectory.

If growth stocks experience another rally, DOCU will certainly be one of the potential winners.",Why I believe DOCU will tank following earnings this week all the way into 2023,1.0,2022-09-07 03:49:22

I'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)

I'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:

1. Earnings
2. Major Economic Events
3. My Watchlist
4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play

There  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading

Ok so let's get this show on the road

**Earnings this week that I will play**

But before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time

How i play earnings:

* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes
* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don‚Äôt  go over 5% size on any earning‚Äôs play
* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad

* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)

**Major Economic events this week**

https://preview.redd.it/fqgg3wooz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cbe5492878cfebe6c452aeda9fd851dd42d08d2

So  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have

Tuesday

10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug

Wednesday  
8:30 am - Balance of trade July

12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech

Thursday  
8:30 am - Initial jobless claims  
9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech

Friday

10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories

12:30 - Fed Walker Speech

As  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.

Market  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:  
I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.  
Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.  
My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.

**Watchlist for this week**

* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target

https://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26

* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly

https://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a

* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.

https://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29

Taking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.

So  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!

**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**

So  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.

Now  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.

Not only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.

So my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!

As  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.

Alright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week‚Äôs play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

1133,1661805304,x0z441,1,"  **Reason #5:** You don‚Äôt know math or don‚Äôt take advantage of it.  
This one is not on the radar for most of you. What is the probability of a person who buys options at any time of expiration to be profitable? Well, it depends on the IV. Now let‚Äôs assume that IV is around 100% which is normal, the MMs don‚Äôt expect crazy volatility so if you‚Äôre right with the direction you‚Äôll be in profit. The chances of you being right are 33.33% How do I know that? Because the market only moves in 3 directions, **Up, Down, and sideways/flat.** That is why the only 3 ways you‚Äôll profit are through buying calls, puts, or through theta. So 33.33%. The only difference between 0DTE and long expiration dates is you have more time to **POTENTIALLY** recover if the stock price went into the other 2 directions. But nonetheless, just because you have 3 months till expiration calls **DOESN‚ÄôT** mean that your contracts will recover. For all we know, the stock price will tank and go flat line for a very long time and the price will recover only 6 months later if ever. Let‚Äôs take it up a notch and go beyond 1-day movement. So if on the first day of buying a contract or a share you have 33.33% of being right, the chances of the same direction price movement are less and less each day goes by since there are other 2 directions the price can move. 

  
So **lesson #5**: Use math to your advantage. As a rule of thumb for me, if I want to buy a call and already see that the stock price went up by $3+ I take it as a loss, or missed boat, and move on to a different play.   
 **Reason #6**: You think the whole world is against you and believe in every conspiracy theory.  
The stock market is a dog-eat-dog world, even though anyone would love to sell you a piece of trash stock for an overvalued price, everyone is on the same boat just on the other side. There are bulls and bears who are actively making the same bet as you, you‚Äôre not the only one who is rooting for a stock. You buy a stock, and so do many others. And let me break down the stigma behind the Technical Analysis aka TA. People love bashing it, saying it is all nonsense, horoscope signs, leaf reading, etc. Truth be told, they are wrong...well not entirely right. There is a reason why we can spot clear and obvious resistance or support levels because that is where many people either buy in or sell out. It is not to say that T.A is always accurate, but it is worth looking into because it just might increase your chances of being profitable. The patterns can fall through or ‚Äúpredict‚Äù the next movement, which leaves you with around a 50% chance, it is just up to you to figure out when to pull out. Also a warning, there could be fake breakouts or falls so keep that in your consideration.

 **Lesson #6:** T.A can be helpful but go in with an exit strategy in case you‚Äôre wrong and expect the pattern to fail. It is much better to lose 10%-20% of your contract, take a step back and change your strategy than just hoping that stock will either recover or dip‚Ä¶ It can, but the chances to have the exact movement that you need to recoup your losses are very small.

1137,1661713772,x03bv9,1,"**Reason #3:**  
You are pumped up on **GREED**. That is something everybody struggles I get that, but many of you don‚Äôt even see that you have it or struggle with it. If a got a penny for every post I came through that said something about ‚ÄúI was up over 500% and now down 98% within x amount of hours, I don‚Äôt know how that happened.‚Äù Because **YOU GOT GREEDY**, you ape. How do you think the stock market works? Stock price only goes up, up, up, and only up? If that was your thought process, quit the game for some time and go back to the drawing board, and learn the basics. I swear you crayon eaters will see over 10,000% gain and still won‚Äôt sell. Do you realize what that means? No? That means you are meant to lose around 99% of your plays, you‚Äôre not meant to win with this mentality. Ever heard of the saying ‚Äúslow one wins the race‚Äù? This saying is 100% true, when people try to get rich quickly they usually get too blind by quick gains and lose their heads.  
This brings me to **lesson #3**: learn the value of money, it is hard to get. There is a quick way to obtain some like behind wendy‚Äôs dumpster, but overall it is hard and takes a lot of effort and time. Be very careful. Just because you can turn $1,000 into $25,000 overnight with stocks doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy, it is very hard and rare, so be very careful with your plays.  
 

**Reason #4:**   
You listen to some schmuck online and take that ape for a profit. Nobody has a magic ball that can foresee the future, it is all chance. This game is so much better than straight-up gambling at the casino because you have significantly more chances of succeeding but still at the end of the day it is still a gamble and just a chance, calculate one but still a chance. I see so many posts saying that ticker **X** will reach **Y or Z** number by the end of this or that date, and you losers buy into it. Nobody knows what the future holds and if somebody says ticker **X** will reach a certain number by the end of someday, **RUN!** They don‚Äôt know what they are talking about, they talk straight out of their ass. Anything is possible in the stock market, the share price can go from $1 to $50 in a day, or can fall over 25% nobody knows what will happen, people just put their bets, which is gambling and that is a very different mindset. If you want to have steady gains and not be hit off guard, do your own research and learn more about the stock market.  
That brings me to **lesson #4:** Never believe what anybody says regarding the price and date of a stock, take into consideration that the future is unpredictable. Do your own math and homework.

1138,1661654307,wzkdry,1,"  What‚Äôs up retarded apes, I‚Äôve been mostly a lurker here and just watch it all burn from the bench. I haven‚Äôt been too long in the game, but I learned a thing or two that I want to share with you banana eater what I learned from my mistakes and just speculations. I hope this will reach at least some people and save you some money. This post is long, so I broke it down into a couple of parts since your attention span is shorter than clownfish's. There will not be TL: DR at the end, so scroll at your discretion. **So why do so many of you lose money consistently?**  
 **Reason #1**: You have 0 ideas about what you are doing.  
 This shouldn‚Äôt even be said but this is WSB so here you go. A lot of you apes have no idea what you are doing, making risky plays, and then go to WSB for advice which is like asking an alcoholic how to stop drinking‚Ä¶You play with options like it has 0 consequences and just cannot go tits up. You guys are buying 0DTE FDs without any research, any considerations, and without reading the news. Your only thought process is something along these lines ‚ÄúI see green/red candle so I think it will remain that way‚Äù and then you go and burn your cash. Please go and learn what options are, the greeks like delta or theta, IV, etc. There are plenty of good youtube videos that explain everything in detail. Once you start applying basics and consider them like High IV, that will stop you from purchasing options and losing money even if you‚Äôre right. For example, you might see a stock price skyrocketing for days and see that options‚Äô IV is over 300% and many of you will look at it and not think anything of it, but if you‚Äôre smart you‚Äôd walk away, accept that you missed the boat and look for another trade. This brings me to a very important **lesson #1**: **learn to walk away, do not fall into a FOMO circle jerk.**   
 **Reason #2:** You have no idea what the point of a stock market is and how to profit from the game.  
 To dumb it down Barnie style, the whole premise of a stock market is to buy shares or options for a specific price and then sell it to somebody else for more, sometimes much more. Which means **nobody here is your friend**. Sure, we can give advice, dd, or words of encouragement here and there but the second we get the chance to profit off you, we will. That is just the game, nothing personal and I have no guilt about selling you shares or options that ran up over 200% for the past 2 days because I don‚Äôt want to be the one left with a bag. So, **lesson #2**: take everybody‚Äôs words with a grain of salt and don‚Äôt look at them like they are your buddy who will throw in their retirement money to ‚Äústick it to the hedges.‚Äù Whenever I see people ‚Äúteaming up‚Äù on this subreddit just makes me lose brain cells that I can‚Äôt afford to lose.

Greetings apes, while this sub‚Äôs attention skyrockets, I figured it would be nice to spread some love for my favorite little EV stock: Fisker (FSR). Before we really get started, I‚Äôd appreciate it if you‚Äôd read [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvvalp/fisker_inc_fsr_dd/) DD from a year ago. It explains a bunch of the positive catalysts that give Fisker extreme potential to become a big player in the EV game soon enough. Just letting you know, literally NONE of them have fallen through since. Fisker is on track to meet all of its old goals, especially one critical one coming up in November.

Now looking back 1 year ago, Fisker was at $14. A few months later, it ripped to $24 with some positive news. Shortly thereafter, the market collapsed and the big fish forgot about speculative investments. They crawled back into their holes and continued to get paid to invest other people‚Äôs money in bonds and AAPL. 

Why does this matter you ask? Well, let me give those of you who didn‚Äôt read the previous DD a quick rundown:

Well, since they last ripped 100%, they‚Äôve managed 50k 250$ reservations and sold out on 5000 down payment pre-orders. That‚Äôs quite a few sales and should help their balance sheet pretty significantly. Given the amount of reservations and selling all of their down-payment pre-orders, they‚Äôve got what they asked for and  what they need to succeed.

Now looking at their short interest, they‚Äôve got a short interest of 35% and a darkpool short interest of 58%. So far they‚Äôve stated they‚Äôre on track to meet all production deadlines, and there doesn't appear to be undisclosed turbulence. If they produce in November and this stock jumps a little, it‚Äôs going to jump A LOT with all that short interest. With that will come a ton of capital for the company, significantly boosting their balance sheets and  allowing them to THRIVE in the future.

I see this as both a solid investment for both the short and long term.

Good evening everyone, today we saw the positive market action from the last few weeks continue on. The major indices opened slightly down from Fridays close but soon rallied and closed higher. Many big name stocks are also continuing to advance and setup for potential new entries.

https://preview.redd.it/eetudt7eazh91.png?width=2276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0f1c674268d999aa774daddb8eac87f1a340c6

SPY broke through its base and has advanced on somewhat decreasing volume. Ideally we would like to see a large volume spike as SPY pushed through that base. The declining volume is something to take note of but is not something to be overly concerned about. We are fast approaching the 200 Exponential Moving Average and a base that was formed in April. This may be a spot of resistance in coming days.

https://preview.redd.it/aww8lrqeazh91.png?width=2281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8950372dd41965339fffb204a134c6a0307760

QQQ pushed through its base today and provided an opportunity to open a position. Similarly to SPY, more volume would have been nice but we are still seeing decent price action. QQQ is a bit further from the 200 EMA and its April base, so there may be more room to advance.

**Recap on recent positions:**

Since the markets have been acting decisively more positive I have taken on several new positions.

QLD is 2x bullish ETF that tracks the NASDAQ 100. For every 1% move the NASDAQ 100 has, QLD will move 2%, positive or negative. I opened this position Friday as QQQ broke through its base. Even with the overall markets behaving better I was still cautious and bought a small starting position of 20% of what I want my final position to be. For example, if my total position of QLD will be 100 shares, I opened this position with 20 and will add more if QLD continues to advance. By doing this you are able to keep your loses smaller since you have a smaller position.

ELF is approaching a short base and may push past the trigger prices of $38.20. ELF is on the list because Sales are up 26% and Earnings Per Share are up 71% year over year. ELF also has 3.9 days of short interest. If we see a push through $38.20 with good volume and a good market this could be a buy.

CLR is approaching a slightly longer base with a trigger of $69.50. Similarly we would need to see a good volume increase through the trigger price and a good market overall.

Lastly, NVDA is approaching a long base from early June and has a trigger price of $192.80. NVDA is a large cap stock and can really move once it gets going.

With all of these potential setups it is important to remember that overall market sentiment can impact how individual stocks behave. If the market is in a bad place it is best not to buy. Also do not go heavy on your exposure, I would only purchase 20% of what you want you final amount of shares to be.

**Bringing everything together:**

The stock market is in a healthy rally and many individual stocks are setting up for potential buys. It is important to keep watching for new stocks that may be breaking out. If a stock is breaking out do not heavily increase your exposure at once. Carefully plan out you buy points incase the market or stock reverses suddenly. Also FOMC minutes are being released Wednesday and that may add some extra volatility to the markets. Overall, we can begin to add exposure but should still have a slightly cautious mindset in case the market turns around quickly.",Market Outlook 08/15/2022,1.0,2022-08-16 01:29:07
1165,1660506269,woevt0,1,"Listen, I didn't mean to offend you, she's a nice lady but don't let that distract from what I have to say:

Everyone wants to know what is going on with the market and ""did we hit the bottom"".  If it pleases the court of angry apes I will attempt to demystify:

Pandemic:  The Fed adds between 5-8 trillion dollars in currency, while the whole world is closed created a falsely unaffected market while the supply chain tightens and shatters and reorders all behind the scenes.  One of the most primary markets remains open, real estate and home buying, during the whole pandemic and sky rockets (or can the apes all say INFLATES).  We get a vax and come out of quarantines and suddenly inflation hits everything.  

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html)

&amp;#x200B;

This scares everyone.  Shit dicks and Nozzles de bagga de douche (it's french) talk about runaway inflation as if the dollar is backed by Madagascarian oil (ridiculous, the dollar is the standard, we'll need bazookas not bucks if the dollar goes under cause we in WWIII) and that covers the big money thinking it's time to reorganize the old folio and reinvest their tendies in all the old money places.  This was always going to happen.  

The market ran faster than Harambe towards the light and you know eventually everyone wants to take a taste of the money life.  So hedgies and everyone else took a haircut roughly six months after the last stimmies were sent out.  Bonds had gone back up so why not put a little something away for the rapture.  I aint pretty so I gotta date seniors and Granny gonna need a new set of titties.  They expensive but tendie titties are the only reason my hands stay diamond.  I tell my ladies ""you gotta pick up what gravity put down"".

Now it turns out that inflation is subsiding and being reabsorbed as the Fed has the opportunity to return some of it's balance sheet and oil is becoming more reasonable.  Everyone is realizing that this isn't 2010 crash,  THERE ISN'T A SUBSTANTIAL MARKET EVENT LIKE A BUBBLE THATS BURST.   Everyone that bought a home during the pandemic has a historically low rate NOT AN ADJUSTABLE RATE THAT CAUSED THE LAST IMPLOSION.

# BUT HERE'S THE KEY:  DURING THE PANDEMIC A SHIT TON OF COMPANIES OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT.  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE GREAT JOB NUMBERS AND STILL HAVE JOB AVAILABILITIES FOR AIRLINES AND NUMEROUS OTHER FIELDS, ETC. 

This means that we have a larger retirement class and a burgeoning, suddenly higher earning (because businesses have raised wages to entice and compete) young middle class.  SP, DOW, NAS all turned back near the 2020 plateaus we were at and here's the kicker.  When you pour 5-8 Trilly into a market only so much can spill out and hold outside.  YOU HAVE TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE.  The vig has been working and those divies are begging the oldheads to get planted.  Look at AAPL, it's up almost to ATH and if Eve weren't such a needy bitch it would be passed it (why do chicks only want to eat what isn't theirs?).  The shorts are ready to call it quits and BBBY is proof of that, clearly there is some reversal energy and just like when I see a little 100 pound gymnast walking a bull mastiff the blockchains and NAS makes me scream out the window ""WHO'S WALKING WHO?"".  I don't know but theyr'e both looking to retrace.

I give this an 80% chance of bull market given the present conditions so where to go?

Personally, I got 1000 shares and 3 modest contracts (I am humiliated at this number and I beg you to roast it as I deserve) of BBBY.  

VUZI (3000 shares and 200 contracts) is the next runner 28% Short of the float with almost 12 days to cover and they already are working with Amazon, just a matter of time till the big order comes then fuck the moon I'M GOING TO MARS.

[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6bx6d3rm2fg91.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb3d24bf0a0bd8446e2a29b44a9c7bc945165041)

...My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. The following  is a summarization of my answer.  


My Thesis on this Play is as follows -  
I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..

  
After the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.

  
‚Ä¶Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it‚Äôs lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- ‚ÄúBuy Buy Baby‚Äù. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.

  
With GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC‚Äôs cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)

&amp;#x200B;

[RC VENTURES BBBY HOLDINGS](https://preview.redd.it/6fyertmk3fg91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478d80696050b72babda6908d275b968acd075ca)

  
As GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  
That said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.

  
Again, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I‚Äôm glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.

  
So again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of ‚Äúmeme basket‚Äù and bed Bath &amp; beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.

  
So back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME‚Äôs stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.

  
I waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time‚Ä¶ either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.

  
As things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  
Then last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.

&amp;#x200B;

[BBBY Short Percentage of Float](https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8705b60271ccf02b2958658978c4855929a5d279)

  
After watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post‚Ä¶ I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)‚Ä¶.  
Anyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.

  
The stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  
So yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  
Eventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.

  
Thursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.

  
Friday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  
So yeah‚Ä¶ I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  
Again, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of ‚ÄúMOASS‚Äù like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.

  
As one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  
 It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.

  
In closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).

So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and subsequent -50% day - the CEO stepped down, and the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.

‚Ä¶Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in march) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it‚Äôs lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- ‚ÄúBuy Buy Baby‚Äù. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated. 

With GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies  with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces on Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which she is just about flawlessly executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market. Especially considering RC‚Äôs cost basis is $15. In addition he holds millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options expiring January 23.

As GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon. 

That said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen‚Äòs factor.

Again, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I‚Äôm glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August. 

So again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of ‚Äúmeme basket‚Äù and bed Bath &amp; beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop. 

So back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME‚Äôs stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.

I waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time‚Ä¶ either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here. 

As things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.

Then last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.




After watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post‚Ä¶ I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)‚Ä¶.

Anyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.

The stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.

So yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.

Eventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.

Thursday it closed at 6.12, and if it were to be able to close above 6.50, The entire float would be in the money via derivatives. That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.

Friday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.

So yeah‚Ä¶ I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.

Again, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of ‚ÄúMOASS‚Äù like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.

As one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.

Hopefully this comment gets pinned in this post. It is my hope that it can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering this trade.

In closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, you could not be more incorrect, in my opinion. As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion nothing else) I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022. I wouldn‚Äôt go  as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it.

In regards to the Yolo‚Ä¶ 

I Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, &amp; the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight. 

I decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why‚Ä¶.

Local and provincial Governments incomes depended on the land sales which in turn would create more infrastructure with debts attached to the banks. With the halt, many provincial governments are financially crippled with **hidden debts suspected to be up to 50% of Nationwide GDP** ( [LINK](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160566/chinas-hidden-corruption-problem-behind-local-debts-goes-hand?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article&amp;campaign=3160566)) .

Increasing Debt to GDP from [bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-06/china-s-debt-to-climb-to-record-in-2022-government-adviser-says) too cheap to pay for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bh40aoqxk1c91.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1ad51969a09933c5b41f59586902fb9e1f08997)

China‚Äôs banks are deeply intertwined with local governments. Many banks offered retarded investment packages instead of actual bank accounts to citizens. These investment packages either included the suspicious provincial government‚Äôs land rights as debt or were outright scams. Consequently many citizen‚Äôs money were not picked up by China's main bank. With zero liquidity, banks closed online access and became really hostile to anyone who was asking for their money. The subsequent bank runs are creating unprecedented demonstrations to force the regulatory commission to release frozen funds ([link](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/banking-waves-china-release-frozen-bank-funds-after-rural-protests-203568)). These bank runs are deeply systematic and need government intervention and will no doubt cause further strain on Chinese incomes. 

Speaking about their infrastructure projects, their water dams are partially to blame for the massive floods throughout China. China currently has thousands of Dams, both active and abandoned. Some active Dams are in deep disrepair due to lack of provincial resources([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07136-0)). With increased rainfall reported throughout the region, the integrity of these Dams are threaten. These officials will suddenly open the flood gates to claim no fault. These floods are specifically pushed towards the rural towns and destroying food production in the South. 

&amp;#x200B;

These food shortages are recognized by the Government. China implemented a Great Leap Forward in food production by forcing local governments to make more food([link](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-seed-industry-seeks-better-laws-support-innovation-318341)). China is also encouraging citizens to limit food waste through either subtle messaging or ordering restaurants to limit the amount of food given. 

Food Shortages have been compensated by the increased import of food. China currently projects to import **100 Million Metric Tons of SOYBEANS** from the Global Market ([link](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/060722-china-climate-change-food-security)). This and other crops imports will increase despite China‚Äôs policies to increase local food production and limit food waste.

Even if the invasion never happens, a ticking time bomb is occurring with the NYSE investigation on China companies audits with even $BABA not passing scrutiny ([link](https://fortune.com/2022/07/08/us-china-companies-stock-exchange-listing-audit-papers/)). These Reports indicate many Chinese companies will be de-listed from the NYSE by 2024 without China giving into demands. 

# Big Elections in November 2022

While Xi removed political term leadership limits in 2018, he still needs to look good for his people. Their ‚Äúelection‚Äù is in November with numerous concerns of fighting off his political Rivals. The humiliation he has been experiencing with his COVID Zero Policy and his Trade War with Australia and USA has been damaging to China economically. 

Xi is unlikely to lose however he does need to show strength within his party soon. He needs a solution that can give him absolute control over the country when you cannot simply print expensive infrastructure bills and ignore rural workers. 

# Their Solution? Taiwan. (But not what you think)

Nothing brings people together like a time of war.

**(Insert American Patriotic Theme)**

We all know the memes and shit posting. We also know China has significantly increased military spending for the past two decades ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China)). However people believe that China will simply attempt to blitz over the 180km strait to invade without a plan. I suspect China will want a quick victory that the West will hopefully ignore and give the Party including Xi a propaganda win at home. 

I do not believe Taiwan itself is in immediate trouble, its islands it controls nearby China are in trouble. Taiwan‚Äôs Kinmen islands are less than 10km (6 miles) from China‚Äôs shore. Recently China has been increasingly harassing Taiwan by invading their airspace([link](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-chinese-military-is-flying-more-combat-aircraft-near-taiwan-2022-7)).  This required Taiwan to respond with their air force in a fight of maintenance attrition from Taiwan repairing their planes. I would not be surprised if it's a psychological tactic similar to some bargain brand Operation Desert Storm. 

Stolen Picture from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China).

The West will not go to war over some rocks near China. However they would increase pressure for a peaceful resolution via Sanctions and weapons deliveries to Taiwan similar to the Russian-Ukraine War. Eventually leading down towards artillery bombardment and sea blockades to starve each island out similar to the first two Taiwan Strait Crisis-es. However I suspect they could leverage their dealings with Russia and their Belt and Road ‚ÄúPals‚Äù to compensate for the sanctions. Regardless this will lead to a globalization breakdown filled with panic and massive sell offs.

The real question comes as China begins to eat up islands belonging to Taiwan. I suspect a positive feedback loop of further investment away from China and China slowly eating up the Islands closest to them and using conquered islands as launching bases. This can increase Nationalistic Fervor within China regardless of how poor the citizens will become.

* Citizens discontent in passive aggression.

*  The QUAD Alliance of Japan, India,Australia, and the USA is the NATO of Asia for military cooperation and encouraging trade deals. Already increases in trade deals are occurring through India and Australia due to China-Australia Trade War tensions for political reasons ([link](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-india-trade-deal-open-biggest-economic-door-morrison-2022-04-02/)). It is also worth noting that Western Countries are starting to realize they prefer to keep their intellectual property rather than constantly looking for cheaper workers. 
* China has been trying to become self-sufficient in recent times. Made-in-China Policy is designed to achieve independence from foreign supplies by 2025 ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025)).  Concerning especially when you remember the US Audit Investigations threaten black listings of Chinese companies beginning in 2024/2025. 
* There is already a noticeable counter-influence towards the Chinese debt traps. The partnership for infrastructure  and Investment (PGII) is a $600B investment scheme for developing nations([Link](https://www.axios.com/2022/06/30/g7s-600b-infrastructure-bid-to-counter-china)). This could scare China into being more aggressive as NATO and other Western Democracies create their own debt lending programs for undeveloped and developing nations. 
* The Data leak is definitely a complete embarrassment to the Party and the Security Forces. I wonder if the data will be an insight to the rotten panda in the zoo. I question the income and expense costs reported in China.

Overall I am expecting the ‚ÄúWe got a Cold War at Home‚Äù version of a Cold War. I believe the Global market is going to lose **1.4 Billion or more people** (China, Russia, Belarus, possibly more) within the following years. 

* Shares in $YANG (3x Bear Market) --&gt; This shit decays so buy shares around $10.
   * I had some shares of Yang before I sold it at $12, I plan to buy more as it decays back down.
* $SQQQ Shares --&gt; US Hedgies and boomers are still praying for a happy Commie China if they could ‚Äújust get rid of Xi somehow‚Äù.
   * Aim for a price of less than $45-50 a share. 
* Shares into India and Mexico ETF --&gt; These are the next closest cheap manufacturing AND closely linked to Western allies. I cannot discuss tickers cuz many are below $500M. Look it up yourselves Retards.
   * Here are some that I currently have: 10x of $EWW Shares ( iShares MSCI Mexico w/ $800M Cap ) , 20x of $EPI Shares (WisdomTree India Earnings ETF w/ $650M Cap).
      * I plan to continue buying more as the weeks continue. I just prefer to lower my cost basis. I can't gamble like some people on here.  
* $AAPL Puts ‚Üí No particular reason, just betting on a decreased nation‚Äôs incomes for one of Apple‚Äôs largest demand of their products. 
   * (Spread Price: Near the money strike with a 10% put debit spread, Date: Mid August) 
      * I suspect you can also bet on other companies that are heavily tied into China but I am not going to list every single one for you. Plus $AAPL has EA on July 28th.

For everyone else, here's what I'm seeing in the charts, if you're into that sorta thing.

**SPY:**

https://preview.redd.it/xp44b7g01ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44f2b518fbe0f3da341b79eebe6a61892e2f6a49

Still have some work to do if we're going to fill that $400 gap.  Rejecting $390 this week may have some of you concerned but checkout the Weekly chart

This weekly chart just further outlines the trend reversal that the daily divergences have been showing leading into this rally.

&amp;#x200B;

**QQQ:**

https://preview.redd.it/7xigs6v63ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b21aa5cff8d8d35acb8c7c6c382e2146a93c5dee

Going to use QQQ this week because some of you are so smooth-brained that you didn't know there were any other NASDAQ ETF's and were so proud of yourselves trying to call me out about it.

Anyway, looks like we've officially broken out of this falling wedge thanks to the big guys waking up (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT), the others are close behind.  I'd be looking for the $300 gap to fill leading into CPI, then a pullback because it's fucked, possibly down to around $285 support, maybe lower.  Ideally I'd be looking for re-entry / entry / adding to longs at a completed back-test of the trendline we just broke this week.  Regardless of what the Fed does this month, this rally has some legs and will continue for a while, or so the technicals are indicating...

For context of the reversal manifesting in the Weekly charts, QQQ's look just like SPY 

https://preview.redd.it/s1hg8thp2ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ff23ad7fe76267e16139bdc1f522c1b3dda2932

Here's a quick look at the put/call ratio, focus on the blue line (9-day MA).  Notice how June 14th we put in a lower high which coincides with the higher low in the indices this week, then crossing down below the 0.95 line breaking trend and confirming that people are becoming more bullish on the market.

&amp;#x200B;

**10Y**

https://preview.redd.it/s10fttq16ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d685f1cc31199945aca3240ca54df8d0acc62b

Still inside this rising wedge pattern on bearish divergence in the PPO and somewhat in the RSI.  Will still need to wait it out but it looks like a reversal is coming in both the 10 and 2 year, keeping in mind, we're STILL inverted since like Thursday of last week.

Let's talk BANKS since we're coming up on earnings next week!

**BAC:  Earnings 7/18**

https://preview.redd.it/58ma3p1f8ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc928df6038897136505e52b56ce61ed524752a4

Bank of America has been in this falling wedge for a while and has recently started to show some bullish divergence in the RSI, not so much in the PPO though.  I think we have a pretty solid floor under us at around $31 which was resistance back in 2019.  We have a gap just above some potential resistance around $34 which I think we hit easily, will deal with the gap when we get there.

**JPM:  Earnings 7/14**

https://preview.redd.it/lsz06oej9ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab06934305b15c42978ca614eaf8f5808cfddb7

JP Morgan Chase!  
JP Morgan Chase!  
JP Morgan Chase!  
JPM has also been inside this falling wedge for a while with a bit better defined bullish divergence.  Again a solid floor under us with a nice rejection off of a previous gap left open since Nov. 2020.  Overhead resistance at $117.50-ish I think will be pushed through pretty easily and likely won't see much push back from the bears until the $125 gap.

**GS:  Earnings 7/18**

https://preview.redd.it/r68xe8pnaha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0192b4927c8aa6793a16e89c8c6d94c5b29dd6

I think I'm less confident in this one.  The falling broadening wedge is bullish but I'm not seeing as solid footing as the others at this point, we're kind of in the middle of support/resistance right now and the divergences in the RSI and PPO aren't really as convincing as JPM.

**VIX**

https://preview.redd.it/85h8p64abha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5767b1fb31bcea6b4c71c31b66f28aa58f36e553

Yah, so what, i do TA on the VIX, wanna fight about it?

Showing the 1-hr chart on this one to keep everyone on their toes.  Today we fell out the bottom of this falling wedge with bullish divergence still intact on the RSI, BUT burned through on the PPO, hopefully that trend continues into the PPO.  Lately the money glitch has been buy puts at VIX $25, buy calls at VIX $35 and I'm here to tell you that didn't work today.

Keep an eye on this bastard though, if it claws its way back into this wedge then look for a big fat stinky dump shortly there after.

**Conclusion:**

I think Bond investors are flooding into equities right now so we're likely going to see continuation of this rally much to the perma-bear's chagrin.  I wouldn't get too comfortable though if you're long because at any moment they could decide to flood back into bonds as a safe haven, it really depends on that the Fed does at the July FOMC, till then however, I'll be buying the dip.

* SPY closed up 0.19%
* QQQ closed up 1.71%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.42%
* VIX closed up 3.07%

The major indices gapped down quite a bit today but recovered and were mostly able to close positive, with the exception of the Dow. However, the Dow isn‚Äôt as important as the Nasdaq or S&amp;P 500 but I include it in these write ups just to be complete. Today‚Äôs price action was very constructive towards the overall market rally as it showed that early selling was quickly overpowered with buying. Even with today ending positive it is still a time to be cautious and limit exposure, especially since FOMC minutes are being released tomorrow. Typically when there is a Fed announcements the markets are quiet and tend to have low volume until the announcement is over.

[SPY Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/64utvdihxx991.png?width=2252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1a2a1e85e72fb3921fece86dc5fee2653426512)

SPY gapped down 1.40% to start the day and continue to drop and undercut Fridays lows. Volume dried up after breaking the lows and we did not see anymore downside. SPY then rallied throughout the rest of the day to close above Fridays highs. Volume today was slightly higher than Fridays but was still lower than than the 50 day moving average. Overall today was still productive towards the general market rally.

[QQQ Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/hjm5xv0ixx991.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b174bcc9a18d525447571346e2f74540885f997)

QQQ gapped down 1.10%, slightly less than SPY, and quickly gained back is losses and closed well above Fridays highs. There was also an increase in volume but still below the 50 day moving average. QQQ also closed above the 8 day EMA (red line). Overall QQQ had a much stronger day than SPY and may be looking to mover higher in the next few days.

**Recap on recent positions:**

SSO opened approximately 2.20% lower than Friday and continued to drop. I sold half of my position as SSO broke below Fridays lows. I then sold my remaining shares as SSO approached Thursdays lows. Looking back now it would have been nice to hold but there was no way of knowing that in the moment.

As we broke into new highs I opened two new positions in both QLD and AMZN. QLD is a doubly leveraged ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100. I made two buys as QLD advance into new highs to avoid buying all of my shares at once. I also bought AMZN since it appeared to be acting stronger than other stocks

**Potential Setups:**

Since I am in two positions I will mainly be monitoring those and looking to add on the my existing shares.

[AAPL Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/th4lubtixx991.png?width=2263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=015310bc6bff9cb2eae0fe53fa8678ae37cdfa61)

However, if AAPL is able to break its recent high I would consider adding a small position. Breaking these highs would be another trigger showing the higher low setup is working.

**Bringing everything together:**

Yesterday was a constructive day in the overall market rally. We still have a long way to go but have to start somewhere.

So the top brokers receiving money from Citadel, Susquehanna &amp; Company all suspended trading...... Focus stays on Kenny (Which is should) but Jeff Yass of Susquehanna seems to fly under the radar. Dont forget he was absent from the Gamestop Hearing....

 I noticed that Citadel, Susquehanna &amp; Peak 6 Investments all have very similar 13F's filled with puts and calls on what would be considered ""blue chip"" stocks. I have noticed these stocks running in similar algo patterns. See here:

This picture above is *even more* bearish. More confirmation of a major reversal coming, even if it's the 1 minute chart.

When the prices were closing on Friday, the price action of all the stocks freaked me out. There were several anomalies that made me [exit all my AAPL call positions:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vjxutl/a_modest_3k_gain_in_3_days_from_11k_to_14k_this/)

1. All stocks across the board exhibited consolidation, which is normally quite bullish, but not all stocks had the same pattern.
2. The volume was too consistently high for a lot of them.
3. There was actually too little volatility that day for my liking.

Put those points together, and there is actually a good chance that players were getting out of the game and exiting, instead of accumulating. 

So out of impulse, in addition to closing my my positions, I took a small risk and bought some 0DTE SPY puts 388 strike.

Back in part 1 I said that tech (faang) is cheap and going to breach its ATH when everyone calms down from the mess (rate hikes, war, oil, covid, inflation)

Well since then everything  became ""more cheap"" and ""more mess"" has surfaced, here's a brief update 

Old mess

rate hikes priced in (still believe SPY year end in the green)

war priced in (Everything is stalled out and I believe that we will have war end by the end of the year, also a catalyst for SPY) (puts on Lockheed martin)

oil priced in (gonna fall by the year's end as production has already ramped up and 180$ oil calls not printed)

Covid gon (sigma male variant not yet priced in so that might still cause some problems(but prob not))

Inflation (the rise of it has slowed down considerably and in my case it will fall cuz everyone's talking about it)

So now the ""new mess"" 

Recession talk - you know that it's already priced in and there has never been an instance when everyone knew and talked about it before it actually happened, so yeah it might be hard to believe but the economy is still strong (LEI)  and we are in for a massive bull run by year's end 

Remember the quote? ""When everyone's scared shitless, buy OTM calls on SPY"" - Warren Buffet

Houses? bro you dont even own one and never will why do you care just go live behind a dumpster and execute trades from your 2012 lenovo laptop with macdonalds wifi

summarized, strong economy (Leading economic index), Everyone scared shitless, obvious correction (look at 2018,1998,2012) Strong yield curve (10 year vs 3 month)- these are the variables you need

Why would something like this happen? First of all, when did the mods suddenly care about our money and well-being? This a casino, and WSB is the casino-iest of casinos. Not only that, OP refused to post his positions.

**Let's look at this with some critical thinking shall we?**

* A. Why would mods give financial advice.
* B. Why would OP be so adamant about a bearish position and ALSO refuse to post positions?
* C. Why would mods allow no positions to be posted?

# There's only one thing that makes sense to me. This is what my wrinkly brain tells me is happening.

1. WSB really is bought out by big money.
2. They are paying for ""DD"" writers.
3. Like MSM, they believe the opposite will happen, and therefore will not post positions.

Otherwise, there is literally no reason for points A, B, and C to exist. Some random guy making a claim? Sure, downvotes away. He's super bearish? Sure, post your position and get upvotes. But for all of these weird coincidences to happen, which usually NEVER happens in WSB (mod-stickied financial advice plus refusal of positions on a big claim), this is the stinkiest shill I've ever seen.

I'm awaiting my ban to verify my claims. If this isn't true, then mods should just be ignoring me and calling me a dumb shill. Here are my positions, calls on AAPL.

I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news.

Key things from today:

1) Price held continuing the sideway shafting for day 7

2) Bollinger Band has now curved up indicating a slight early bullish action in the short term.( see screenshot)

3) $ES certainly wants to test the high 4185-4200 range and see if it can break out

4) A break of 4200 on ES will certainly test the 4300 resistance and eventually work its way to 4380-90 range where there are a lot of trapped bulls . All this can happen before FOMC on the 17th.

A better strategy for tracking Pelosi is to only copy her trades of companies headquartered in California and DC, because those are the companies that feed her that good good insider information.

**Background**

We all just wanna trade like Pelosi and ride that sweet insider information to glory. But as I noted in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uu6hc6/if_pelosi_cant_beat_this_market_what_hope_do_we/), Nancy has had a disappointing reversion to the mean after several years of outperformance. Did she get greedy? Was it a classic game of telephone where the information was distorted and led to bad trades? Is she human after all?? Who can say... But it's up to me to figure out how to get our dear Speaker back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

**The New Strategy**

If the opposite of Pro is Con, then the opposite of progress is... This is the kind of high level logic I used to determine where ole Nancy wen't wrong. Surely she's getting insider information from companies, but she has to mask that with some garbage trades (probably sourced from WSB). How can we identify  the good trades from the bad?

Location, location, location.

Pelosi is a powerful figure in California and Washington D.C. It makes sense that she would be connected with companies headquartered in those states. The tech giants of Silicon Valley and legacy companies headquartered in D.C. that keep Congress' pocketbooks full in exchange cost-plus government contracts. **So I made a new Pelosi tracking strategy that follows her trades, but ignores any companies headquartered outside California and D.C.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Results**

That's more like it! This Pelosi tracker is back on top with a 50% outperformance over the S&amp;P 500 in the past 2 years. Even with the massive drawdown to start 2022, Pelosi would be killing it in the market if she just stuck with the companies she's connected to.
